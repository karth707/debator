Teaching creationism in US schools A new Tennessee law will permit teachers to discuss creationism alongside theories of evolution , writes Casey Selwyn .<-->N
The case On April 11 2012 , Tennessee passed a law that protects teachers who choose to explore the merits of creationism alongside theories of evolution in public school science classes .<-->N
Governor Bill Haslam claimed that the legislation would not change scientific standards in schools and refused to sign the bill .<-->N
However , he refused to veto it either , so the bill became law .<-->N
Tennessee thus became the second US state to enact such legislation , following the academic freedom law of Louisiana in 2008 .<-->O
It purports to support teachers wanting to help students understand , analyse , critique and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories .<-->O
Its scope is not limited to evolution , as global warming and human cloning are also open to critique .<-->N
These three theories are widely accepted in terms of scientific merit .<-->N
Critics named the bill the Monkey Bill after Tennessee s 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial , in which John Scopes was convicted under state law for teaching evolution and later exonerated on appeal .<-->N
The law has attracted criticism , and some fear that it will inspire other states to pass similar bills in addition to acting as a backwards move in the fight to improve science and maths education in the US ; others claim it violates the principle of the separation of church and state .<-->O
Its supporters believe that it encourages healthy scepticism among students and that critical thinking and analysis fosters good science .<-->O
Author opinion While the principles of academic freedom and critical thinking are of vital importance in fostering good science and education policy , I do not believe this Tennessee bill encourages these principles .<-->O
Firstly , Tennessee undermined its own free speech credibility in education policy when that state s House Education Committee passed a Don t Say Gay bill on 18 April 2012 , which prevented teachers from discussing homosexuality .<-->N
Secondly , despite a provision in this law that claims that it does not promote any religious or non-religious doctrine , it clearly provides space for a religious creationist agenda .<-->O
While scientific principles uphold free speech to the highest standard in the practice of rigorous theory testing and the questioning of unproven facts , providing space in curriculum for children that promotes discredited theories while not truly subjecting them to rigorous scientific analysis provides them with a distorted view of facts versus fiction .<-->O
So , while critical analysis does foster good science and is necessary to uphold principles of free speech , it seems that an alternative , an unchallengeable defence of creationism seems to be a cover for the promotion of ideology over science , even while it is being presented as an example of free speech that should be protected .<-->O
If parents want to teach their kids about creationism , or the church does , that is absolutely acceptable , but to promote it as science in a secular public school setting is inappropriate .<-->O
Otherwise it seems to violate first amendment principles of freedom of religion , as demonstrated by the 1987 supreme court ruling that requiring creation science to be taught alongside evolution is schools is unconstitutional .<-->O
Should teachers have free speech in schools ?<-->N
Ehh I m not sure .<-->N
I m on the fence about this one .<-->N
I think it depends on what the class is . .<-->N
And what exactly the teacher is saying .<-->N
I think it is fine if the conversation or discussions is in some type of relation to the class .<-->N
Freedom of speech does not apply in the classroom ; students are not allowed to stand up and discuss whatever issues they want and neither should the teacher .<-->O
Both have to stick to a syllabus that ensures that the children are taught the basics of each subject .<-->N
-LRB- idebate.org http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/freespeechdebate/house-believes-tennessee-correct-protect-teachers-who-wish-explore -RRB- -LRB- for -RRB- I don t completely disagree that teachers shouldn t have free speech I think it should only be to a certain extent .<-->O
A class like yours Noblitt is completely okay because for the most part we stay on topic or we talk about current events .<-->O
Creationism should remain in religion classes and evolution should remain in science classes .<-->N
-LRB- idebate.org http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/freespeechdebate/house-believes-tennessee-correct-protect-teachers-who-wish-explore -RRB- -LRB- against -RRB- Anything that has anything to do with personal beliefs or sensitive subjects such as religion or something of that nature should stay in classes that are related to that certain subject .<-->O
Teachers should not be able to have free speech in schools if they are trying to force their beliefs on students or making them feel pressured into talking about something they don t feel comfortable talking to a teacher about .<-->O
Overall I don t really have a side I m 100 % sided with .<-->N
I agree with both arguments .<-->N
EXTRA CREDIT .<-->N
Constitutional protection if they are speaking about issues of a public nature , rather than those things about which they have a personal stake .<-->O
-LRB- http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/Main-Menu/Public-education/The-law-and-its-influence-on-public-school-districts-An-overview/Free-speech-and-public-schools.html -RRB- I agree with what most of this website says about teachers freely doing things .<-->N
They should be able to have free speech but only to a certain extent , they shouldn t be able to speak of things to a student that doesn t want to about personal beliefs and personal life decisions .<-->O
Judge said the school district was within its rights to terminate Mayer because of various complaints it received from parents about her teaching performance .<-->N
-LRB- http://www.progressive.org/news/2006/03/3210/judge-rules-teachers-have-no-free-speech-rights-class#.dpuf -RRB- I thought this article was kind of interesting because it talked about a teachers actual experiences about her free speech with her students .<-->O
Obviously the students and parents were offended by what she talked about and clearly didn t like it so since it causes so many issues with parents and students teachers should have to watch what they say when teaching in school .<-->O
Yes , teachers should have freedom of speech .<-->N
Teachers are looked at as role models or mentors .<-->N
If they put creationism into their lesson then I think it would be awesome .<-->O
But that s from a person that believes in creationism .<-->N
For people who don t believe in it then it will be controversial .<-->O
It would make more sense , then , to keep separate studies separate .<-->N
-LRB- http://ncse.com/cej/2/1/why-creationism-should-not-be-taught-as-science -RRB- -LSB- outside source -RSB- Some people agree with my point of view , I am not saying discussing this in schools is the best idea in the world , but it is certainly not the worst and it could be beneficial -LRB- http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/freespeechdebate/house-believes-tennessee-correct-protect-teachers-who-wish-explore -RRB- I think it should be taught and information given but teachers shouldn t push their own beliefs on to students .<-->O
If the student wants to know more then they could talk about it but they shouldn t criticize skeptics .<-->O

Tennessee passes law allowing creationism in the classroom Well , that s it then .<-->N
Tennessee s governor , William Haslam , allowed a clearly antiscience bill to pass into law .<-->N
It is now legal to essentially teach creationism in Tennessee public school classrooms .<-->N
You can read about the background of all this in an earlier post .<-->N
The TN House and Senate both passed this terrible , terrible bill , and Governor Haslam allowed it to beome law , saying , I do not believe that this legislation changes the scientific standards that are taught in our schools or the curriculum that is used by our teachers .<-->O
However , I also don t believe that it accomplishes anything that isn t already acceptable in our schools .<-->N
This is , to not to put too fine a point on it , a crock .<-->O
The legislation is designed specifically to allow creationism to be taught in classes , something the courts have clearly stated is against the law , and which just as clearly is unacceptable in our schools .<-->O
Governor Haslam , I ll note , didn t actually sign the bill into law .<-->N
In Tennessee , a bill passes by default if the governor takes too long to sign it .<-->N
By not vetoing it directly , he allowed it to pass .<-->N
That action , combined with his wishy-washy statement , makes it clear he is doing this for purely political motives .<-->N
This way , it s a law and the creationists are happy , and if people accuse him of weakening the Constitution and allowing a specific religion to be taught in public schools which he s doing then he can say he didn t actually sign the bill .<-->O
Nice , huh ?<-->N
So instead of doing the right thing , he has allowed students in classrooms across Tennessee to undergo religious indoctrination , despite a prior and clear Supreme Court ruling making it illegal .<-->O
And for this those of you who will want to split hairs and say this law only makes it legal to teach scientific weaknesses , and doesn t make it legal to teach creationism , I call baloney .<-->O
There is zero doubt zero that this will be used to teach creationism in the classroom under the guise of demonstrating -LRB- what they claim , wrongly , as -RRB- weaknesses in evolutionary science .<-->O
-LSB- Update : Steve Novella at the NeuroLogica blog has more details on this . -RSB-<-->N
So , unless and until someone fights this law and takes it to court to preserve the scientific integrity of the Tenessee public school classroom ------------------------ 4 .<-->O
Bill would protect teachers who teach creationism A Billings legislator has reintroduced a bill that would encourage high school teachers to present evolutionary biology as disputed theory rather than sound science and protect those who teach viewpoints like creationism in the classroom .<-->O
House Bill 321 is drafted by Republican Clayton Fiscus , who put forward a nearly identical bill in 2013 to emphasize critical thinking with regard to controversial scientific theories on the origin of life .<-->O
The supposed controversy doesn t exist among scientists , say advocates and educators .<-->N
It s all bunk , said Glenn Branch , deputy director for the National Center for Science Education based in Oakland , Calif. -LSB- Fiscus -RSB- thinks that these whole fields are scientifically controversial , and that s not true .<-->O
There is nothing controversial about the biology of evolution , he said .<-->N
There are controversies within biological evolution .<-->N
Fiscus bill does not mention alternative theories by name , but states that teachers must be permitted to help students review the strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories .<-->O
Branch said the anti-evolution law would mean teachers who elevate fringe ideas couldn t be held accountable by principals and superintendents .<-->O
It s inviting the teachers to go rogue , he said .<-->N
Fiscus , who represents HD 43 in the Billings Heights , did not respond to requests for comment .<-->N
But in the taped 2013 committee hearing , Fiscus said his bill would protect academic freedom , not attack science .<-->O
What we want to emphasize is critical thinking , he said .<-->O
It s no different than being on the farm .<-->N
When you re raising animals , you got ta think , you got ta do .<-->N
There s no boogeyman in this bill , he said .<-->N
Fiscus appeared to express personal skepticism toward accepted science during the hearing , however .<-->N
During his concluding remarks , he said evolutionary history involves a monumental leap and said the U.S. suffers from global warming creep .<-->N
And that s going to be in the schools , he added .<-->N
Fiscus also sought to illustrate the progression of human knowledge , saying that we re getting smarter faster than we ever did before .<-->O
Seven hundred years ago , there was critical thinking , he said .<-->O
Everyone was looking around , and the world was flat at that time .<-->N
Then about three or four hundred years later , Columbus proved it was round .<-->N
The idea that the explorer Christopher Columbus , who reached the Americas in 1492 , disproved flat Earth theories is a well-documented myth .<-->N
Branch said the way HB321 is drafted would allow teachers to espouse virtually any belief as scientifically valid , from herbal medicine to geocentric theories of the universe .<-->O
There s nothing ruling that out of this bill , he said .<-->N
A 2004 U.S. District Court case involving schools in Dover , Penn. , ruled that a policy requiring intelligent design be taught as an alternative to evolution violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .<-->N
One in eight high school biology teachers said in a 2007 survey that they include creationism as a valid scientific alternative to Darwinian evolution .<-->N
Craig Beals , a Billings science teacher and the 2015 Montana Teacher of the Year , isn t one of them .<-->N
The topics have long been debated not because scientists disagree but because the topics don t always agree with people s beliefs , he wrote in an email .<-->O
Beals said he doesn t shy away from evolution , climate change or the Big Bang in his classes .<-->N
Nor does he discourage students from expressing their opinions .<-->O
The discussions and debates allow students to showcase their opinions and allow students to hear alternate ideas from classmates .<-->O
And , because I teach chemistry and biology , we always conclude with the latest accepted scientific findings in order to separate opinion from science , Beals wrote .<-->N

5 Crucial Reasons to Teach Creationism in Public Schools Should creationism be taught alongside evolution ?<-->N
Is it fair to give students only one theory to believe ?<-->N
Is it legal to do so in the public schools ?<-->N
There are No Criticisms of Evolution There are no criticisms of the theory of evolution in any of the textbooks or course materials , despite the fact that evolution can not be stated as a scientific law and remains , for well over a century , a theory .<-->O
For one thing , evolution can not be validated to be factual because it can not be proven through scientific testing .<-->N
How can evolution ever be established to be conclusive by empirical scientific methods ?<-->N
Can evolution be observed in a laboratory ?<-->N
Is evolution repeatable ?<-->N
Is it predictable as to what will mankind look like in a million years from now ?<-->O
How can it be falsified ?<-->N
The classic historical structure of having scientific beliefs pass from theory to law is by having something be observed , repeated , to make predictions based upon those observations and have a repeated outcome and then falsify that the results .<-->O
Evolution is a historically based theory based upon assumptions from what took place millions of years ago .<-->N
What are missing are the gaps of transitional fossils that establish one specie evolving into another , new specie .<-->F
When there is yet another claim that a missing link has been found , the question arises , where is the chain in the first place ?<-->N
How can we claim to have found a missing link while there isn t even a chain ?<-->N
Maybe you ve seen the images or pictures of man evolving from apes in textbooks .<-->N
What are missing are transitional fossils between the ape and man so educators have to depend upon images and drawings to try and establish a connection .<-->O
It s because there are no fossils that they can take pictures of to display as proof .<-->N
Scientists have at their disposal , hundreds of millions of fossils and fossil samples , yet not one set of transitional fossils revealing specie evolving into another has ever been found .<-->N
Despite untold millions of categorized fossils their remains no set that establish a new life form evolving from another .<-->N
This fact was not lost by Darwin who said that he was troubled by the lack of fossil evidence showing that new species arose from previous ones .<-->O
Critical Thinking Skills It seems that public schools value critical thinking skills yet they are cramming an unproven theory down the student s throats and so it appears that they won t even consider other possibilities .<-->O
These educators are like dictators who essentially spout It s my way or the highway .<-->N
Since educational leadership want students to think outside the box in the other disciplines , why aren t they allowed to do so regarding the theory of evolution .<-->O
They say that they want the students to use their minds to solve problems , analyze issues , to critique thesis s , but how can a student do this if they are taught that the theory of evolution has no alternatives .<-->N
There are no other options , no other possibilities .<-->N
They are taught that there are no exceptions to the theory of evolution .<-->N
Even the educational textbooks are silent on the problematic areas of evolution .<-->N
For example , evolution does not address the question of where did the universe come from .<-->N
How did the universe come into existence ?<-->N
How did life arise since we know for a fact that life can not arise spontaneously ?<-->O
The theory of evolution is like coming into a movie that is half way through to the end .<-->N
What happened before life got here ?<-->N
How was non-living , inorganic matter able to come to life ?<-->N
The theory of evolution only deals with the fact that life had already existed and that life forms evolve into new species .<-->N
It seems to me that they are leaving out some crucial components .<-->N
It doesn t address the cause of these effects , how a universe from a singular point began or what forces were involved and necessary to have that first spark of life occur .<-->N
What about the Cambrian Explosion , a layer where almost every single life form is found in fossil form with few ancestral fossils before it or no new life fossil life forms above it ?<-->N
This sounds more like a philosophy than it does a science .<-->N
Children should be at least exposed to or taught other views and be allowed to make their own decisions based upon the information or the lack of information that they have .<-->O
Give Parents What They Want A 1991 Gallop Poll -LRB- Nov 28th , 1991 -RRB- , which was the last time a comprehensive polling results on a national scale was undertaken , indicated that 47 % of Americans believe in creation over evolution and 40 % believe that God used evolution as a process of creating life .<-->O
A few had no opinion and so that left only 9 % of Americans who believe that God was not involved and that only naturalistic means were the cause of the origin of life .<-->O
Since almost 9 out of every 10 Americans believe that God was involved in creation and just under half of those believed that the origin of life was not naturalistically caused , why do almost 100 % of college professors and staff teach that evolution is the only option possible ?<-->O
These professors and the colleges seem to be in the minority , yet they do not tolerate differences of opinion or belief , even though the theory of evolution has never been comprehensively established as a fact .<-->O
Why not let people choose what they want their children to learn ?<-->N
Don t these professors and colleges work for the students who pay their salaries or the parents who educate their children ?<-->N
Why is there no tolerance for those who differ in opinions and hold to a different belief than an unproven , untested theory ?<-->O
Good question .<-->N
Children should be taught that evolution is only a theory and to see that a theory is not the same as a scientific law like Newton s Three Laws of Motion .<-->N
Freedom of Speech I believe that students should have the option of stating their own beliefs and base them upon what findings they gain in their education .<-->O
Former President George Bush once said that Both sides ought to be properly taught so people can understand what the debate is about .<-->O
Part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought -LSB- and -RSB- people ought to be exposed to different ideas .<-->O
Academic freedom is what brought the theory of evolution to the classrooms in the first place and so what is wrong with the idea of allowing others to provide their views on how life came into being and if it did evolve or didn t evolve .<-->O
Shouldn t we let them freely express what they believe and provide the reasons for why they believe what they do believe ?<-->O
Good science has always allowed for controversy in the classroom and so educators should allow for rational scientific discussion and criticisms of the theory of evolution .<-->O
By the way , educators should not state that evidence for Darwinian evolution is overwhelming and indisputable .<-->O
Evolution is Bad Science Mankind used to believe that the earth was flat and that if a ship sailed too far it would end up falling off the edge of the earth .<-->O
That is because we believed only with our eyes .<-->N
The theory of evolution is much like this in that a theory or belief is taught as scientific fact because of what they perceive even though nothing could be further from the truth .<-->O
Teaching evolution as fact is just plain bad science .<-->O
Evolution is closer to a philosophy than it is a science .<-->N
One example is that mutations are a good thing .<-->N
I heard about a dairy farmer who had a dairy cow that gave birth to a calf with two heads .<-->N
That is a mutation .<-->N
The problem was that the calf died since it was sending different signals to its digestive system and survived for only a few days .<-->N
If you had asked the dairy farmer if that mutation was an advantage , he would have said no because the calf died .<-->N
I have never seen or heard of a mutation where it helped the specie propagate or survive and become a better organism .<-->O
If you asked biologists if mutations are a good thing , they might give you a funny look because mutations are basically a change that takes place in the nucleotide sequence within the genome of an organism .<-->O
These mutations are the result of DNA or DNA genomes that were unrepaired and will lead to errors in the replication process of additional cells .<-->N
Even so , evolutionists claim that mutations are how life forms eventually evolve into a new life form .<-->N
Evolution requires positive mutations , which are so rare that scientists have problems finding them in nature .<-->O
What they do find are mutations that are extremely harmful and sometimes fatal to the organism .<-->O
In order for evolution to work it needs an increase in information by means of positive mutations .<-->N
The only problem is they can t find where this occurs by natural means .<-->N
Another good example of bad science in the theory of evolution is that they keep claiming to find missing links and that these links are the smoking gun of evidence in the fossil layer .<-->N
The only roaring evidence is the roaring silence in the fossil record .<-->N
This was exactly the reason that Darwin had great doubts in his theory because he couldn t find any transitional fossils showing evidence that specie evolved into other life forms .<-->O
And how do they explain the Cambrian explosion or the Cambrian rock , where there are exceedingly few fossils that come before the Cambrian layers .<-->N
There are primarily only three such fossils and they lay adjacent to the Cambrian layer , as close in fact as to almost appear in that layer .<-->O
One example is the Cloudina and Namacalathus mineral tubular fossils .<-->N
Despite the claim that they are millions of years old they remain virtually unchanged today from when they first appeared !<-->F
Then there are the Mollusc-like Kimberella and its trace fossils -LRB- also unchanged as of today -RRB- and then the Mollusc-like Kimberella and its trace fossils .<-->N
Needless to say , these too have not changed at all .<-->N
Why haven t they evolved or changed by increased information as a result of positive mutations ?<-->N
Incidentally , the Cloudina are the oldest known evidence in the fossil record of the calcified skeletal formation in metazoans , a prominent feature in animals appearing in the Early Cambrian and not before .<-->N
There is also good fossil evidence that exists for the appearance of gastropods , cephalopods and bivalves which are classified as Mollusc-like Kimberella and its trace fossils , which by the way , are also found in the Cambrian period .<-->N
Recently , the fossil record of the earliest animals from the Ediacaran to the Cambrian was made but the dating and interpretation of these remain controversial .<-->N
As Wikipedia has stated , The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian fauna , seemingly abruptly and from nowhere , centers on three key points : whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian ; what might have caused such rapid change ; and what it would imply about the origin and evolution of animals .<-->O
Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence , based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks .<-->O
So , it is not only up to interpretation but this interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence and it is based mainly on incomplete fossil records and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks .<-->O
The words interpretation and the fact that there is a limited supply of evidence due to an incomplete fossil record sound highly speculative and subjective at best .<-->O
Conclusion Part of the reason that creationism or at least , intelligent design should be allowed to be discussed in the classroom is because evolution presents a world view without God and that there is only survival of the fittest and that there is no real purpose for mankind other than eat , drink , and be merry for tomorrow we die .<-->O
The theory of evolution portrays mankind as only a collection of molecules as a result of blind , accidental chance with the only reason we were born was to survive .<-->O
God did create us for a purpose and it wasn t to be moved up to the highest order on the food chain .<-->N
It was to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever .<-->N
We have a purpose in life and God s will is that we believe in the Son of God .<-->O
To reject God as Creator is to imply that God did not create except by random chance or blind occurrences by way of evolution or that there is no Creator at all which denies reality -LRB- Rom 1:20 Psalm 19:1 -RRB- .<-->O
Creationism should be taught but it should begin at home .<-->N
Those who claim that God used evolution to complete His creation are robbing God of glory and God will not ever share His glory with another -LRB- Isaiah 42:8 -RRB- .<-->O
----------- 6 .<-->N
The Bible v. the Constitution Politicians , school boards , principals , and teachers are pushing creationism on kids .<-->N
T hen a student in Louisiana opens her textbook in biology class , she might not have the standard Miller and Levine Biology with a dragonfly on the cover , and she might not ever learn about evolution .<-->O
For some Louisiana public school students , their science textbook is the Bible , and in biology class they read the Book of Genesis to learn the creation point of view .<-->O
Through a public records request , I obtained dozens of emails from the Bossier Parish school district that specifically discuss teaching creationism .<-->N
Shawna Creamer , a science teacher at Airline High School , sent an email to the principal , Jason Rowland , informing him of which class periods she would use to teach creationism .<-->N
We will read in Genesis and them -LSB- sic -RSB- some supplemental material debunking various aspects of evolution from which the students will present , Creamer wrote .<-->O
In another email exchange with Rowland , a parent had complained that a different teacher , Cindy Tolliver , actually taught that evolution was a fact .<-->O
This parent complained that Tolliver was pushing her twisted religious beliefs onto the class .<-->N
Principal Rowland responded , I can assure you this will not happen again .<-->O
Another email was sent by Bossier High School assistant principal Doug Scott to Michael Stacy , a biology teacher at that school .<-->N
I enjoyed the visit to your class today as you discussed evolution and creationism in a full spectrum of thought , Scott wrote .<-->N
Thank you for the rich content as you bring various sources to bear in your curriculum .<-->O
The Louisiana Science Education Act , passed by the state legislature in 2008 , permits science teachers to use supplemental materials to critique evolution , opening a backdoor that these teachers are using , as intended , to teach creationism .<-->N
Such lessons are allowed under this Louisiana law , but they are illegal under federal law .<-->N
We know that one in eight high school biology teachers advocate for creationism , even though it 's unconstitutional , says Josh Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education .<-->O
These emails make clear that many teachers are interpreting the Louisiana Science Education Act as allowing such unconstitutional and scientifically-misleading lessons .<-->O
On April 22 the Louisiana Senate Education Committee voted on a bill to repeal the Science Education Act , referred to by many on both sides as the creationism act .<-->N
This was the fifth vote since 2010 , and legislators voted 4 3 to keep creationism in Louisiana classrooms .<-->F
In April , here at Slate , I published evidence that creationism was being widely taught in Louisiana schools .<-->F
During the Education Committee hearing to repeal the Science Education Act , I provided that research to the chairman of the committee , Sen. Conrad Appel .<-->F
It included a letter from more than 20 Ouachita Parish science teachers who said they were teaching the discrepancies of evolution .<-->F
I guess Appel ignored the evidence , because he cast the deciding vote for creationism .<-->F
After the hearing I followed up with the Ouachita Parish school system to learn how the discrepancies in evolution were being taught .<-->F
I obtained a PowerPoint about the origin of life that is used in Ouachita Parish Junior High School s life science classes .<-->N
It presents evolution as just a theory and says that theories are possibly true but not known or proven to be true .<-->O
Creationism is also presented as a theory and given equal footing with evolution .<-->N
Students are taught that the -LSB- b -RSB- asis for creationism is founded in Genesis of the Bible , and Creationism relies on the claim that there is a purpose to all creation known only to the creator .<-->N
Louisiana politicians have supported the Science Education Act because they intended it to allow creationism in the classroom .<-->N
Gov. Bobby Jindal , who signed the Science Education Act , said it was for creationism .<-->N
What are we scared of ?<-->N
Jindal asked .<-->N
State Sen. Ben Nevers said he sponsored it in the Senate because creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin 's theory . ''<-->F
In April state Rep. Frank Hoffmann , a state House sponsor , confirmed the law was for creationism .<-->N
The Ouachita Citizen reported that Hoffmann told it that Louisiana science curriculum policy recommended a scientific discussion in the classroom of scientific theories including creationism and evolution .<-->N
Legislators have used the act to pressure school districts into teaching creationism .<-->N
In repeated emails to the Bossier Parish school district , state Rep. Thomas Carmody -LRB- who co-sponsored the Science Education Act -RRB- asked how the district was complying with his law .<-->N
I appreciate your expediting the confirmation of your district 's effort to comply with the stipulations outlined in the Louisiana Science Education Act , Carmody wrote .<-->N
School boards have also used the act to push for creationism .<-->N
At a 2010 Caddo Parish School Board meeting , board member Steve Riall said he knows the Governor has granted permission for districts in Louisiana to give equal value in teaching evolution and creationism , according to the meeting s minutes .<-->N
And creationism certainly is being taught in Caddo Parish schools .<-->N
Charlotte Hinson , a fifth-grade teacher at Caddo s Eden Gardens Magnet School , wrote a column for the Shreveport Times in which she declared : My job is to present both -LSB- evolution and creationism -RSB- because God made science .<-->N
In an email to a Bossier teacher , Hinson said that despite a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union warning against teaching creationism , she had the support of local lawyers , her principal , and the school board .<-->O
The principal and school board reminded me I did nothing wrong , she wrote .<-->N
Times are getting harder and harder ... . .<-->N
I feel the end is near .<-->N
Be blessed !!!<-->N
The Bossier Parish teacher exchanging emails with Hinson was Carolyn Goodwin , who teaches at Stockwell Place Elementary and is also a creationist .<-->N
Bossier -LSB- school district -RSB- has it s -LSB- sic -RSB- problems but there are so many awesome Christians from the top down , Goodwin wrote to Hinson .<-->O
We pray at school functions and probably break the law all the time !!<-->N
Louisiana school districts are clearly breaking the law all the time , but the Louisiana Legislature still refuses to repeal the Science Education Act .<-->N
These newly released emails , from districts across the state , show that this law is being used systematically to teach creationism in public schools .<-->N
This puts Louisiana on a collision course with a First Amendment lawsuit .<-->F
I asked Andrew Seidel , a lawyer for the Freedom From Religion Foundation , which litigates separation of church and state cases , about the legal situation surrounding the law .<-->N
It was clear when the -LSB- Science Education Act -RSB- was passed that it was just another shameful attempt to circumvent the First Amendment , Seidel told me .<-->O
He went on to warn teachers against teaching creationism , and said , No state law , including the Louisiana Science Education Act , can shield public schools and public school teachers from liability for violating the U.S. Constitution .<-->O
Several separation of church and state advocacy groups , including the FFRF and the ACLU , have their eye on Louisiana .<-->N
All it will take is for one Louisiana parent or student to sue the state for endorsing religion in public school , and teaching creationism will become illegal again .<-->O
But for the moment , because Louisiana politicians refuse to take action , Louisiana students are reading Genesis in science class .<-->N
Zack Kopplin is a science education activist who has fought against creationism being taught with public money .<-->N

Why Creationism Should Not Be Taught As Science Part 2 .<-->F
The Educational Issues One can ask a number of questions about creationism : Is it a religion ?<-->F
Is it scientific ?<-->F
Is it legal to teach it in the public schools ?<-->F
Would it be practical to include it in the science curriculum ?<-->N
This article deals with the last of these questions , looking at the educational consequences of creation teachings being given `` equal time '' in public school science .<-->N
The legal , scientific , and , especially , religious issues are not ignored , however , for they have a direct effect on this very pragmatic issue of insuring an adequate education for public school students .<-->O
The Importance of Religion Religions play a significant role in our society , particularly those relying on the Judeo-Christian Bible .<-->N
Furthermore , those faiths promoting various literal interpretations of that book are becoming among the most vocal in the nation .<-->N
To neglect this fact in the public school curriculum , to give religion no place whatever , would imply either a myopic or anti-religious outlook .<-->O
Therefore it is only reasonable that religion , the Bible , and , yes , even Special Creation , should have its place in the education of our youth .<-->O
This idea was well expressed by Jerry Bergman in the February , 1980 Acts & Facts , published by the Institute for Creation Research .<-->N
He wrote , `` The very fact that we usually do not mention religion or religious issues means that we are teaching very definite ideas about religion , especially that religion is not important ... To say that the schools can teach the entire world of knowledge but must exclude religion is censorship of the worst sort ... There is no academic freedom where every area of knowledge can be taught except one ... '' Dr. Bergman then went on to add , `` If schools are to be a place where students can debate important questions , it would seem that eliminating religious questions would shelter students from an important area of debate which is crucial for living a well-rounded life . ''<-->O
- page 7 - It is refreshing to see such a liberal -LRB- dare I say humanistic ? -RRB-<-->O
idea appear in one of the most radical creationist journals of wide circulation .<-->O
Dr. Bergman seems to be advocating classes in comparative religion , comparative anthropology , comparative sociology , or their like .<-->N
So am I .<-->N
A Category Mistake Since religious liberals and conservatives both agree that comparative religion belongs in the public schools , where is the point of contention ?<-->O
It is simply this : Creationists , including Dr. Bergman , would like to see religion , at least in the form of Special Creation , brought into the science classroom .<-->O
And though some creationists have attempted to demonstrate that `` scientific '' creationism is not religious , Dr. Bergman apparently has not .<-->N
In the aforementioned article he wrote , `` Religion is a belief structure , and all fields of knowledge are based on belief structures , even though some fields of knowledge include more empirical content than others . ''<-->O
This would seem to mean he thinks any religious implications should be forthrightly discussed in every subject area .<-->O
Certainly Christian Heritage College -LRB- a division of which is the Institute for Creation Research -RRB- does this .<-->N
There is n't one course of study offered where the Bible is n't a textbook , a point the college boasts of in its catalog -LRB- Christian Heritage Courier , 1979 -RRB- .<-->N
But is this effort to religify every subject , from physical education to wood shop , practical for the public schools ?<-->N
Not unless our idea of practical includes pinpointing the religious differences between students so they can form their battle lines and create campus strife .<-->O
And there is an interesting contradiction here , too .<-->O
If Bergman is trying to deny that a line can be drawn between the sacred and secular in education , we must ask if he is using the Constitution to support this .<-->O
Most creationists cite the Constitution for their own ends .<-->N
But the very Constitution cited draws just the sort of line between sacred and secular that Bergman seems to deny !<-->O
It would make more sense , then , to keep separate studies separate .<-->N
Religion , including various creation stories , should be taught in a suitable context of its own and not miscategorized in the science curriculum .<-->N
And within that context , each creation myth and each philosophy of origins should get equal time with the others .<-->N
This would successfully meet the creationist demand for equal time on religious grounds , and ought to end that part of the battle .<-->O
Theories of Education But what about the demand for equal time on scientific grounds ?<-->N
Assuming , for the sake of argument , that creationism is non-religious , that it attempts to offer evidence in support of its conclusions , and that it is a competing theory to evolution , should n't it be heard ?<-->O
- page 8 - How one answers this question is determined by how one views education .<-->N
If the purpose of the public schools is to be a forum for every possible scientific and non-scientific theory , if the job of teachers is to merely expose students to the various trends in our society , and various fringe theories , then creationism definitely has a place in the science curriculum .<-->O
But this implies there is no such thing as knowledge , or at least there are no reliable experts who can be depended on to tell us any facts .<-->O
After all , if the student is left to sort truth from falsehood , fact from fallacy , then there must be nothing the teachers feel confident enough about to forthrightly teach .<-->O
If schools are to be debating societies , then the administration must take a totally non-committal position on what is true , and merely give equal time to all competing opinions .<-->O
This would be an exercise of radical skepticism or insecurity .<-->O
On the other hand , if education , in large part , amounts to passing on the discovered knowledge of one generation to the next , and if there is such a thing we can label as `` knowledge , '' and if we accept there are some people who have more of this knowledge in certain areas than other people , then creationism could not be included .<-->O
This is because , at present , the consensus of knowledgeable scientists in the fields related to evolution maintains there is simply no serious ground for holding creationism to be true .<-->O
The evidence creationism is based upon has been found insufficient .<-->N
Now , parents have a right to choose , through the ballot box , the sort of public education they want for their children , the quality of school officials they will support in office .<-->O
But , if they accept the `` back to basics '' model of education , if they want their children learning facts and not merely toying with opinions , then there is no ground for them approving `` equal time '' for creationism in the science curriculum .<-->O
This is a bitter pill to take for many .<-->N
They see `` equal time '' as something American as apple pie .<-->N
And it is , around election time .<-->N
But education which imparts factual knowledge is not a political campaign , it is a learning experience .<-->O
And truth is not determined by majority vote , but by the merits of the case .<-->N
Creationists , however , have two ready answers to this point .<-->O
They either claim creationism is being discriminated against in the scientific community and so is not given a fighting chance to get its voice heard -LRB- evolutionists are narrow-minded bigots -RRB- , or they charge that evolution is actually not accepted as much as people think -LRB- it is a `` club secret '' among scientists that evolution is bankrupt -RRB- .<-->O
To answer these charges will require a separate article on the science issues .<-->N
Suffice it to say here that this is the same tactic used by most all the pseudoscientific charlatans in the business .<-->N
If their views are rejected , usually because of poor evidence , they shout `` conspiracy '' and go directly to the public .<-->O
It is an easy thing to reject standards when one 's theory does n't measure up .<-->N
It is an easy step to take the political route when one 's theory is n't hearty enough to make it over the rocky road of science .<-->O
- page 9 - So , in the context of a basic education system that recognizes the existence of knowledge and a body of professionals who have a consensus on some subjects , the introduction of `` scientific creationism '' into the science classroom would only open a can-of-worms .<-->O
Soon every crackpot theory that had adherents enough to start a lobby would have to be included .<-->N
Here 's a probable list : 1 .<-->N
Astrology would be granted equal time with astronomy .<-->F
Pyramid power would be matched side-by-side with modern physics .<-->O
Divining rod technology would be taken seriously for the benefit of future oil geologists and hydraulic engineers .<-->O
The toxemia theory and Christian Science `` negative thinking '' theory of disease would get equal time with the germ theory .<-->O
The flat earth theory would get equal mention with the space program .<-->N
It would be easy to go on , but let 's stop and detail this last one just to show how serious the issue really is and how similar the demands of these other theorists might be to those of the creationists .<-->O
Leveling with the Geographers Charles K. Johnson is president of the International Flat Earth Research Society , an organization of 1500 members , many of whom are doctors , lawyers , and other professional and educated people .<-->N
He holds that scientific evidence supports the flat earth hypothesis , and , like creationists , appeals to `` well known '' and `` easily observable '' facts .<-->O
One sample bit of observable evidence for his position is the flatness of water .<-->N
Anyone can see that water is flat .<-->N
Therefore , if you expand on what you see right in front of you , the only possible conclusion is a flat earth !<-->O
Experimental evidence for this disc shaped plane also abounds .<-->N
For example , when Columbus sailed to America -LRB- and Columbus is one of the heroes of the flat-earthers -RRB- , he did n't fall off like his men thought he would .<-->O
This is because the earth is not a globe .<-->N
Johnson 's wife , Marjory , comes from Australia , and Johnson declares , `` She 's sworn out an affidavit that she never hung by her feet in Australia .<-->N
She sailed a ship over here , and she did not get on it upside down and she did not sail straight up .<-->O
She sailed straight across the ocean .<-->N
We consider that a very important proof that the world is flat . ''<-->O
To further complicate matters , Johnson sees the flat earth idea as a religious issue too .<-->O
No doubt he can quote chapter and verse to show that the Bible , properly understood , supports his position .<-->O
`` The Bible is a great tangle of history and corruption and so forth , '' he says , `` but the aim of it all is a one-world , flat-Earth society , for honesty and decency and that sort of thing . ''<-->O
Certainly his view could be mentioned in comparative religion .<-->N
Although Johnson is n't hard at work lobbying or fighting court cases , he has gotten his view heard in the public schools .<-->O
For example , he addressed students at Beverly Hills High School on at least one occasion , and with the continuing good press he is getting he is likely to have other opportunities .<-->O
NBC and the National Enquirer , not to mention local radio talk shows and newspapers all over the country have given his Society coverage .<-->N
- page 10 - The reason why so many believe the world is a globe , Johnson notes , is because science is promoting `` a fraud to keep the common people in the dark . ''<-->O
The Apollo moon program was just a movie .<-->O
`` Arthur C. Clarke wrote it and directed it .<-->N
But he knows the Earth is flat . ''<-->N
It seems the only redeeming feature of the globular theory is that it provides jobs .<-->N
To get the truth out , Johnson publishes the Flat Earth Quarterly `` with the objective to restore the world 's sanity . ''<-->O
`` We consider this the world 's most superstitious age , '' Johnson states .<-->O
`` We try to get people to use their minds logically . ''<-->N
-LRB- Schadewald , 1977 ; Ashland Tidings , 1978 . -RRB-<-->F
Theories of Origins Obviously , the creationists do n't have the only alternate science in town .<-->N
But let 's narrow our focus a bit and concentrate on just the teaching of scientific hypotheses about origins .<-->O
Here the creationists maintain there are only two basic views : creation and evolution .<-->N
Because many would disagree , let 's list some of the other possibilities : 1 .<-->N
Sudden appearance of chaos from nothing , and out of chaos come the gods who create man and the animals .<-->O
-LRB- Hesiod 's Theogony is an example of this . -RRB-<-->N
Sudden appearance of something superior which is now in a state of decline .<-->O
Gradual growth of something inferior into a state of perfection .<-->O
Cyclical fluctuation between perfection and imperfection .<-->N
An eternal and unchanging universe in which all apparent changes are only local and minor .<-->O
When faced with a list like this , creationists attempt to label everything listed as being evolutionary in some way , usually noting that all have some sort of gradual change present .<-->N
The same criterion , though , would place Special Creation in the evolution pile as well .<-->O
This is because Special Creation is like number 2 , particularly in how the theory requires a declining cosmos in its interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics .<-->O
Nonetheless , whenever the point is raised that there are other theories of origins , and particularly other Biblically based theories , the creationists disagree .<-->O
They regard the various efforts to `` harmonize science with scripture '' as acts of surrender .<-->O
It is their position that the harmonizing theories say nothing scientifically different from modern evolution .<-->N
That is , they make no unique predictions and appeal to no unique evidence ; they are simply efforts to fit the Bible into the theories of modern science .<-->O
For this reason , Special Creationists refuse to call these theories creation theories at all -LRB- there is only one true creation theory -RRB- .<-->O
- page 11 - Dr. Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research made this plain in a debate on the religious issues with Dr. Jerry Albert in 1977 , when he said , `` We can drop this term ` Special Creationist ' and ` Theistic Evolutionist . '<-->N
You are either a creationist or you are an evolutionist , you ca n't be both . ''<-->N
That Dr. Gish 's way of viewing these theories is inaccurate can be shown if we approach each Bible based theory in its turn .<-->N
Alternate Views from Genesis The Day-Age Theory : This is the position that each `` day '' of creation in the Genesis account actually represents a `` long period '' rather than a typical 24hour solar cycle .<-->O
Some denominations give specific lengths of time to these periods , quoting II Peter , 3:8 , which says '' ... one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day . ''<-->N
However , most Day-Age theorists prefer to be less specific and allow for millions of years .<-->O
What makes this theory unique is its predictions regarding the fossil record .<-->N
To be verified , it would only have to be shown there was evidence in the rocks of six separate creation epochs , coinciding with the events of each of the six days of scripture .<-->N
This means six separate and distinct creations -LRB- which may or may not have been followed by subsequent evolutions -RRB- .<-->N
It is clear this theory does not harmonize with evolutionary geology .<-->N
This is so because it requires a different order of events than evolutionists posit .<-->N
Even creationist Henry Morris sees this .<-->F
On pages 56 to 62 of Biblical Cosmology and Modern Science , he lists 25 discrepancies between Genesis and the evolutionary sequences .<-->N
So serious is this problem , it has caused Day-Age Biblical theorist Davis A. Young to propose that the `` days '' of Genesis actually overlap each other .<-->O
`` If such overlap exists , then all apparent discrepancies between Genesis 1 and science would fall away . ''<-->O
-LRB- Young , 1977 . -RRB-<-->N
The Day-Age theory also does not harmonize with creationist geology .<-->N
This is because it does n't require that most all the fossils be laid down in a single year of world-wide flooding .<-->N
Therefore , in the light of all this evidence , it appears the Day-Age theory is indeed a unique hypothesis deserving as much public school time as does Special Creation .<-->O
The Gap Theory : This is the position that there is a gap between the first and second verses of Genesis .<-->N
The result is two distinct creations .<-->N
The first creation involved all the now extinct life forms , like the dinosaurs , and the second , occurring in six solar days six thousand years ago , involved all the life forms we see today .<-->N
Since the prehistoric animals were destroyed in a catastrophe other than Noah 's Flood , flood geology is not as important in this model as it is in Special Creation .<-->N
However , since they were not destroyed by the normal processes of change and gradual extinction , evolutionary theory plays an even smaller part .<-->N
- page 12 - This makes the Gap Theory unique .<-->N
And the fact that it has two creations , rather than the six of the Day-Age Theory , proves it even more distinctive .<-->O
It predicts that no fossil animals should be found this side of the second creation of six thousand years ago unless there is evidence that such animals were separately re-created .<-->N
Special Creationists do n't like this theory because it accepts the idea of an old earth .<-->N
However , like Special Creation , it accepts fixity of species and uses the standard creationist arguments to prove organic evolution is `` impossible . ''<-->O
Its flood model differs scientifically in one major respect from that of Special Creation .<-->O
That is , it claims only `` modern '' animals died in the deluge .<-->N
Adherents of this unique viewpoint include the Jehovah 's Witnesses and Armstrong 's Worldwide Church of God , both being religions that claim to be truly literal in their interpretation of scripture , and both being strong propagandizers against evolution and for creation .<-->O
If Special Creationists get equal time , so should these people .<-->N
Progressive Creation : This is the theory that God continually creates new things .<-->N
There is no evolution .<-->N
The evidence creationists constantly cite about gaps in the fossil record actually supports this theory better than it does that of Special Creation .<-->O
This is because unexplained gaps seem to point to the Creator intervening in each gap , not to a one-shot recent creation .<-->O
In fact , this theory can accommodate the existence of the geological column much better than can Special Creation -LRB- which depends on a turbulent flood to stack up the strata so nicely -RRB- .<-->O
Frequent evidences of catastrophism over time are another support for this theory which runs against the grain of the Special Creationists ' singular catastrophic flood .<-->O
But this also puts it out of step with evolution , which rejects the notion that catastrophes coincide with every gap , and that all gaps are unexplainable without divine intervention .<-->O
So , both Special Creation and Progressive Creation interpret the scientific evidence differently from each other and from evolution .<-->N
Furthermore , both religious models also differ in theology .<-->N
This can only mean that Progressive Creation , too , must be heard in any discussion of origins which introduces alternate models .<-->O
An Old Earth The `` compromise with evolution '' these theories really seem to make is the acceptance of a very old earth ; nothing more .<-->O
Is this grounds for the ICR creationists to take adherents of these theories to task ?<-->N
Not at all , because ICR creationists have , on other occasions , shown apparent tolerance for these viewpoints , indicating they are `` open '' to this old earth option .<-->O
- page 13 - In particular , the narration that goes with slide 48 of Creation and Evolution : A Comparison of Two Scientific Models -LRB- an audio-visual aid for public schools put out by ICR -RRB- , declares : `` The creation model does not require an immensity of time .<-->N
The Creator could have accomplished creation in six days , six billion years , or instantaneously .<-->N
A young age for the earth and a recent creation are thus options open for consideration by creationists , who are not committed to evolutionary uniformitarian geology . ''<-->O
This seems to imply that evolutionists are dogmatic , but creationists are flexible and able to consider more than one option .<-->O
Do they mean it ?<-->N
Is this why they rarely debate the age of the earth , but prefer to ignore that point and get on to other things ?<-->O
Or is this deceptive ?<-->N
If they are open , they should n't criticize `` theistic evolutionists , '' who are also open and offering an option .<-->O
But if their model requires a young earth , they should always say so , and slide 48 should n't say what it does .<-->O
One thing is clear , however .<-->N
They ca n't have it both ways in the public schools .<-->N
They ca n't be `` open '' to `` options '' and still dogmatically declare there are only two possibilities .<-->N
They ca n't throw `` theistic evolutionists '' in the evolution category simply because these people are willing to accept an old earth .<-->O
But Dr. Morris , the Director of ICR , seems to settle this question on page 71 of Biblical Cosmology and Modern Science when he vigorously proclaims , `` It is high time that Christians face the fact that the so-called geologic ages are essentially synonymous with the evolutionary theory of origins .<-->O
That latter in turn is , at its ultimate roots , the anti-God conspiracy of Satan himself ! ''<-->N
-LRB- Morris , 1970 . -RRB-<-->N
This quote , however , is ten years old .<-->N
To be fair , what has he said lately ?<-->N
Well , in a cover letter to the March , 1980 Acts & Facts , Morris writes : One of the greatest obstacles to the return of real creation teaching in our nation is the indifference of so many Christian people to the issue .<-->O
They often justify this attitude on the basis of their assumption that people can believe in theistic evolution -LRB- or progressive creation -RRB- and still believe in the Bible .<-->O
They feel that the evolutionary ages of geology can somehow be accommodated in Genesis , by means -LRB- usually -RRB- of the `` local flood '' interpretation of the Noahic Deluge and the `` day/age '' interpretation of God 's week of creation .<-->N
That honest and consistent Biblical exegesis excludes this interpretation is clearly demonstrated in ... the enclosed March issue of Acts and Facts .<-->O
I hope this study will encourage large numbers of sincere Christians everywhere to take a more forthright , Scripture-honoring stand on true creationism .<-->O
In analyzing this general creationist attitude Dr. Richard Haas , in a statement signed by six other biologists at Fresno State College in 1972 , hit the nail right on the head .<-->O
- page 14 - He wrote : `` It seems clear that the attempted inclusion of creationism stems from individuals convinced that not only is creationism a viable alternative doctrine equivalent in scientific validity to the concept of organic evolution , but implicit in the requirement is the assumption that the Judeo-Christian fundamentalist approach is the sole such alternative ... It seems clear to us that this requirement reflects an arrogance that supposes that Judeo-Christian tradition is the sole valid framework within which one answers questions of ultimate cause while the myriad of other theological systems adhered to by men past and contemporary are not worthy of consideration .<-->O
This is clear , for , if it were not the assumption , obviously any teacher would be obliged to consider all alternative creationist doctrines , a task that would occupy all his time . ''<-->O
-LRB- Haas , 1972 . -RRB-<-->N
Alternate Religious Views But it does n't stop there .<-->F
Other religions have theories of origins which also make scientifically testable predictions .<-->F
Let 's look at a few of these : The Hare Krishnas are creationists of a sort .<-->N
They have their own creation research group , called the Bhaktivedanta Institute , which sends out periodic blasts at evolution and gives arguments in support of their theory of `` production . ''<-->O
As Jnana Dasa -LRB- 1979 -RRB- in Back to Godhead magazine explains it , `` This theory proposes that biological forms do not arise from the spontaneous self-organization of matter , but rather under the direction of a superior intelligence .<-->O
Furthermore , it suggests that life and consciousness are not material phenomena , the results of physiochemical reactions .<-->N
Instead , they result from a distinct , irreducible , nonphysical principle or entity , which is present within the material body during an individual 's lifetime , and whose departure from the body leads to the change called death . ''<-->O
This nonphysical entity , the `` Supersoul , '' is indestructible and eternal , a `` particle of spiritual energy '' that has neither birth nor death , but simply passes from physical body to physical body in a process of reincarnation .<-->O
Some of the evidence used to support this view is much the same as the negative evidence Special Creationists use against evolution .<-->O
Krishnas talk about probability , `` living fossils , '' lack of transitional forms , lack of conceivable transitional forms , necessity of design and intelligence in nature , and the inability of scientists to turn matter into consciousness .<-->O
On the positive side , however , are appeals to quantum physics .<-->N
Here the Krishnas are looking for consciousness amid the subatomic particles , as are authors Fritjof Capra -LRB- The Tao of Physics -RRB- and Gary Zukav -LRB- The Dancing Wu Li Masters -RRB- .<-->N
They bring the evidence of modern physics into play in order to demonstrate their agreement with British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington , who declared `` the stuff of the world is mind-stuff . ''<-->N
- page 15 - The Krishnas , after satisfying themselves that `` the nonexistence of intermediate biological forms implies some kind of absolute information or guidance that transcends the categories of ordinary science , '' go on to propose how contact with this `` transcendental source '' can be made .<-->O
The avenue `` consists of an elaborate scientific method for establishing a personal relationship with the Supreme .<-->N
This method , called bhakti-yoga , is quite similar to modern science , in that it depends on clearly specified procedures leading to reproducible results .<-->O
It is experimentally verifiable , for it is based on direct personal experience attainable by anyone who carries out the procedures correctly . ''<-->O
-LRB- Thompson , 1979 . -RRB-<-->N
Whether most scientists would find this approach scientific is not to the point .<-->O
Obviously the Krishnas and other mystics think it is , and therefore would probably want it seriously considered in the science curriculum .<-->O
A similar position is held by Scientology , giving mysticism even more clout .<-->O
Scientologists reject evolution as a view that `` promotes man as nothing but an animal evolved from mud . ''<-->O
But they also reject traditional Christianity , saying , `` Man does not have a spirit - he is a spirit . ''<-->O
-LRB- Rev. Wolery , 1977 . -RRB-<-->N
Buddhism presents an interesting paradox because it is an eastern religion which easily accepts biological evolution .<-->N
This is because Buddhists reject the notion of an immaterial soul and tend in many ways to be materialists .<-->O
Most Buddhist sects also reject notions of God .<-->N
Yet the discoveries in modern physics interest them as much as they interest the Krishnas , though they might put somewhat different interpretations on them .<-->O
The main cause of life , they maintain , is desire , and this could conceivably be understood in some physical , and hence testable , way .<-->O
The Mormons have a special problem all their own .<-->N
In addition to being Day-Age theorists -LRB- God lives on the planet Kolob which rotates on its axis once for every thousand years of earth time , hence a day to God is a thousand years to us -RRB- , Mormons are also rejecters of ex nihilo creation .<-->N
Joseph Smith made it plain in the King Follett sermon when he said , `` Now , the word create came from the word baurau , which does not mean to create out of nothing ; it means to organize ; the same as a man would organize materials and build a ship .<-->O
Hence we infer that God had materials to organize the world out of chaos choate matter , which is element , and in which dwells all the glory . ''<-->O
-LRB- Swyhart , 1976 . -RRB-<-->N
This view might also require equal time in science classrooms .<-->O
Because House Bill 690 of the Georgia State Legislature defined `` scientific creationism '' as '' ... the belief , based upon scientific principle , that there was a time in the past when all matter , energy , and life , and their processes and relationships were created ex nihilo and fixed by creative and intelligent design . ''<-->O
If other bills attempt to do the same thing , then the Mormon position will have to be viewed as a specie of evolution , a view Mormons surely will not tolerate .<-->O
-LRB- They are among the leaders in the effort to get creationism into the public schools . -RRB-<-->N
Therefore , creation from nothing and from something will both have to be considered .<-->N
- page 16 - Other Classroom Subjects So far we have only been dealing with the science curriculum .<-->N
Yet the issue goes far beyond that .<-->F
In 1976 , Creation Life Publishers put out a creationist school history textbook .<-->N
One of the authors , Mary Stanton , wrote in the March 1977 Acts & Facts that teleology , or God 's guiding purpose , must be included in history studies .<-->N
She sees history and the Bible as `` two of God 's media for revelation . ''<-->N
An advertisement for this Public School text , which is called Streams of Civilization , says the book offers : `` Sound Christian teaching of history .<-->N
The great men of the scriptures take their rightful places .<-->O
Presents Noah and the flood as historical fact .<-->N
Shows Jesus as more than just a man . ''<-->N
-LRB- Institute for Creation Research , 1976 . -RRB-<-->N
Yet , as if this were n't enough , Stanton opens up the biggest can-of-worms of all by pointing an accusing finger at historians who `` continue to make Rome the first center of the Church , '' and who `` give credit to Rome for establishing the solid foundation of Christianity and for spreading the Gospel during the first centuries after Pentecost . ''<-->O
-LRB- Stanton , 1977 . -RRB-<-->N
Her book , of course , changes the emphasis to the Byzantines , a fact that will guarantee a counter equal-time demand by Roman Catholics .<-->O
What may be good religion to the protestant fundamentalist is clearly not good secular history for public schools in a pluralistic society .<-->O
The Creation Explanation by Robert Kofahl and Kelly Segraves is another creationist book that talks about history .<-->N
Although this volume is n't intended for public school use , and although it is primarily about science , it does illustrate the creationist position on historical matters .<-->O
On page 116 it speaks about the origin of human language in this wise : `` Scientific data from the languages of many tribal peoples reveal form as highly developed and structured as our own .<-->N
This suggests that while language has obviously changed with time , it has not necessarily been evolving upward from primitive simple language .<-->O
The biblical view is that man has had complex language from the beginning of the race . ''<-->N
On pages 117 and 118 the book goes on to challenge the idea of cultural evolution .<-->N
In typical creationist fashion , `` authorities '' are quoted to show the impossibility of early man developing from the hunting and gathering stage through the agricultural village stage to city-state civilizations .<-->N
`` In other words , the factual evidence for the evolutionary transition has not been discovered .<-->N
That it took place is , therefore , a matter of faith , not historical evidence . ''<-->O
To the creationist , civilization springs full blown on the scene from almost nowhere , leaving the Ark as the only possible explanation .<-->O
- page 17 - As creationists begin demanding a two model curriculum in history , as well as science , two novel alternate views of history immediately come to mind : 1 .<-->O
Erich Von Daniken has gained fame , and wealth , for his `` Chariots of the Gods '' theory .<-->N
In his view , `` ancient astronauts '' from other worlds were the source of most human societies and were instrumental in their development .<-->O
Another author , physicist Dr. Irwin Ginsburgh , goes even further and maintains that Adam and Eve were astronauts who landed on earth 6,000 years ago .<-->N
In his book , First , Man .<-->N
Then Adam !<-->F
, Dr. Ginsburgh maintains that the coming of Adam and Eve from another world pulled man out of the stone age .<-->F
Interbreeding between humans and these `` astronauts '' answers the age old question : `` Where did Adam 's sons find wives ? ''<-->F
-LRB- McCandlish , 1979 . -RRB-<-->F
Should this get equal time ?<-->F
Dr. Maxine Asher rejects Van Daniken 's hypothesis in favor of her own view that early civilizations sprang up from the remains left by the sinking of Atlantis 92,500 years ago .<-->O
This idea could easily appeal to the same historical evidence Kofahl and Segraves cite in The Creation Explanation .<-->O
In the view of Asher and other Atlantis searchers , modern civilization has not yet caught up to the level that was present on Atlantis in its heyday .<-->O
We could go on and branch out into still other subjects of study .<-->N
Then it would be necessary to have psychology students learning exorcism and spell casting .<-->O
Law students would have to get all the details on trial by ordeal and how to apply the water treatment for the detection of witches .<-->O
And , of course , let us not forget the stork theory of human reproduction as a requirement in sex education .<-->N
When Bette Chambers , president emeritus of the American Humanist Association , was asked in a recent TV interview why she would not favor teaching creation and evolution side-by-side , she replied , `` Because creationism is religion and evolution is science .<-->O
It 's mixing apples and oranges and coming up with fruit salad . ''<-->N
Of course we can see now how the introduction of creationism will lead to a fruitier salad than most people suspect , one that will have the schools teaching everything from primeval soup to nuts .<-->O
Startling Views of Creation Scientists At this point , some people will sneer incredulously , `` All that weird occult stuff is n't factual knowledge .<-->O
There 's no chance it will get into the school curriculum .<-->N
Who are you trying to kid with this alarmist scare tactic ? ''<-->O
But there is no kidding going on when one realizes that most of this material can already be found in most high school libraries , and when one sees that Transcendental Meditation , astrology , psychic phenomena , and UFO research have already been taught in some schools .<-->O
These ideas are all around us , students are thinking about them , as are their parents .<-->N
It is thus an easy thing for such subjects to find their way into the regular curriculum unless a decided effort is made to confine them to the library and possibly to classes in social science .<-->O
- page 18 - But even if we stick our heads in the sand and imagine such problems do n't exist , that such studies have no chance in the public schools , we must still face up to the `` weird '' teachings of the creationists themselves !<-->O
None of the fringe ideas previously mentioned can hold a candle to creationist astronomy .<-->N
The proof is in the reading .<-->N
On pages 66 and 67 of Remarkable Birth of Planet Earth , Dr. Henry Morris offers his explanation for the existence of certain astronomical oddities `` the fractures and scars on the moon and Mars , the shattered remnants of an erstwhile planet that became the asteroids , the peculiar rings of Saturn , the meteorite swarms ... reflect some kind of heavenly catastrophe associated either with Satan 's primeval rebellion or his continuing battle against Michael and his angels . ''<-->O
He adds ... `` Angels , both good and bad , can be shown Biblically to have considerable knowledge and power over natural processes and , thus can in many cases either cause or prevent physical catastrophes on earth and in the heavens .<-->O
In any event , this type of cause warrants further research as a potential explanation for apparent disturbances in the stars and planets since their creation . ''<-->O
-LRB- Emphasis added . -RRB-<-->N
Dr. Morris says objects in our solar system would behave oddly due to these star wars , `` in view of the heavy concentration of angels , both good and evil , around the planet Earth . ''<-->O
Morris even suggests that astrology is true due to `` evil spirits '' who live on the stars and use their demonic forces against the earth .<-->O
However , outside these angels and devils , Morris does n't believe in extraterrestrial life .<-->N
He explains it in this wise on page 63 : `` This possible association of angels with the stars , incidentally , is the only suggestion that Scripture makes concerning intelligent life on other worlds .<-->O
There are definitely no men , or man-like intelligences , living on other planets or , stars ... '' Perhaps this is why creationists often feel the space program is a waste of time .<-->O
Now , will creationism require equal time for this in astronomy and science courses ?<-->N
Must we keep our telescopic eyes peeled for Michael and his angels ?<-->N
And must we teach anti-science in the science classroom , inculcating apathy toward the space program and other scientific research that goes against the grain of creationists ?<-->O
Yes we must .<-->N
And we will also have to consider Dr. Duane Gish 's position that certain dinosaurs breathed fire .<-->O
And , since dinosaurs lived at the same time as man according to creationism , this accounts for the dragon legends that are mentioned in the mythologies of various world peoples -LRB- Gish , 1977 -RRB- .<-->N
- page 19 - One could list a whole catalogue of creationist oddities or `` weird ideas , '' ones that put pyramid power and the Loch Ness monster to shame !<-->O
-LRB- Oops , I forgot .<-->N
Creationists believe in the Loch Ness monster too .<-->O
The proof is in the 1979 Films for Christ production called The Great Dinosaur Mystery . -RRB-<-->N
A Matter of Academic Freedom In our day and age , classroom time in the sciences is at a premium , particularly in the secondary schools where the entire field must be covered in one junior or senior high school year .<-->O
With so much to teach , there is simply no room for side-issues , controversies scientists do n't take seriously , wild new proposals , and the like .<-->O
The student has his or her hands full just mastering the basic material .<-->O
Can you imagine losing half the time in two-model education ?<-->O
Can you imagine losing much more in the necessary multi-model education that would include astrology , Atlantis , the human aura , and the creation story of the Hopi Indians ?<-->O
So much time would be robbed placating these various pseudoscientific and religious groups that little time would remain for providing the learning necessary for students who wish to pursue careers in science .<-->O
The basic question is , should generally rejected theories about science get equal time with established positions which have the weight of evidence behind them and the consensus -LRB- or near unanimity -RRB- of scientists ?<-->O
Put another way , should any unestablished generally unaccepted theory get equal time with theories that had to go through the long process of proof and production of evidence ?<-->N
Creationists argue that giving their view equal time is just `` fair play . ''<-->O
But the idea of applying a `` fairness doctrine '' to science education reveals a lack of understanding of what science is about .<-->O
Science does n't work on `` fairness '' but on merit .<-->N
The position that has the best evidence , has withstood a long barrage of criticism , has been modified in the face of new data and is in harmony with it , and has the most support from knowledgeable workers in the field is the theory that should be given the emphasis in education .<-->O
Any other approach would imply that science is simply a matter of capricious opinion , and that one theory is just as good as another .<-->O
This may be true in religion , where the ideas can not be verified , but science is quite another matter .<-->O
This is why science can neither be treated on a `` fairness '' system nor mixed with religion .<-->N
Furthermore , it is contrary to the idea of academic freedom to attempt to mandate one minority group 's ideas of `` fairness '' in the public schools .<-->O
In some of the proposed `` two-model '' legislative bills , teachers not conforming to the creationist idea of fairness could expect fines or loss of jobs .<-->O
But the teaching of evolution is not similarly required or enforced .<-->N
As Mayer -LRB- 1978 -RRB- argues , `` It is a feature of academic freedom that the content of a discipline is not prescribed by law . ''<-->O
- page 20 - But , as with their approach to science , the creationists have an alternate view on academic freedom too .<-->O
To them , academic freedom means telling teachers what to do , where to do it , how to do it , and the degree to which it must be done .<-->N
But there is nothing free about setting such requirements or using intimidation in order to get a particular view added to the curriculum .<-->O
Nor is it academic freedom to force the teaching of every possible view on a subject .<-->O
Correctly defined , academic freedom is the freedom of the scientific community to establish by research and consensus what the most reasonable position is , and then to be allowed to present that position , without coercion or censorship , in the schools .<-->O
A Matter of Honesty But , aside from freedom there is the issue of credibility .<-->N
Jerry Bergman , in his booklet advocating equal time for creationism -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , correctly notes : `` Establishing teacher credibility requires presenting material in non-dogmatic ways according to the merits of the facts . ''<-->O
But this is not what equal time for creationism would do .<-->N
The `` merits of the facts '' happen to favor evolution .<-->O
But the two-model approach implies that informed scientific opinion is equally divided on the issue of origins .<-->N
To teach that this is the case when it is not , and when the evidence for evolution is clearly demonstrable , is to dishonestly mislead students .<-->O
Such an act is unethical and the betrayal of a public trust .<-->O
Furthermore , it is an irony when one considers that creationists profess to do this in the interest of increasing morality in society .<-->O
-LRB- Evolution supposedly promotes amorality . -RRB-<-->N
If we take Bergman at his word , and go by the `` merits of the facts , '' then we will operate on a merit system in science and give every theory its just due -LRB- and no more -RRB- .<-->O
This means creationism would indeed have a place in the science classroom - as a discredited theory on a par with Lamarkianism , or as a minority fringe theory on a par with Velikovsky 's Worlds in Collision .<-->N
That would be honest .<-->O
And while we are on the subject of honesty , it would be wise to appraise creationist textbooks and audio-visual aids on how they live u , p to that virtue .<-->O
Let us begin with the Creation-Science Research Center 's Science and Creation Series .<-->N
Richard M. Lemmon , when reviewing this series for the California State Department of Education -LRB- 1975 -RRB- noted that , `` The discussions of protein accumulation on the prebiotic Earth -LRB- pages 63 to 66 of the ` Handbook for Teachers ' -RRB- is a bad and , I fear , deliberate , distortion of the scientific research of the past two decades . ''<-->O
He also noted : `` The ` Handbook for Teachers , ' page 27 , says that ` genuine science gives no firm evidence that the earth is more than several thousand years old . '<-->N
One hundred years ago that statement may have had some credence among educated mankind .<-->N
Today it is only laughable .<-->N
The world 's libraries are full of books that give overwhelming evidence to the contrary . ''<-->O
His overall conclusion was : `` These books are totally unfit for adoption in our schools .<-->N
Any use of these books in any school will cripple the students ' understanding of science . ''<-->O
- page 21 - The Institute for Creation Research in their audio-visual aid , Creation and Evolution : A Comparison of Two Scientific Models , make a number of statements that scientists in general would regard as false or misleading .<-->O
Here are just a few : `` As a matter of fact , however , neither creation nor evolution is a valid scientific theory ... if the evolution model is a true model , we would expect to discover living things evolving from non-living , inanimate substances ... Creationists maintain that the Second Law of Thermodynamics thus directly contradicts evolution .<-->O
Evolutionists believe , however , that there must be a way out of this apparent dilemma . ''<-->O
Evolutionists are represented as being Lyell-style uniformitarians who believe that `` most geological formations have been caused by present processes ... acting at essentially present rates . ''<-->N
It should be no surprise , then , that many scientists find this audio-visual aid , and most other ICR two-model materials , a gross misrepresentation of the evolutionary position .<-->O
So , if creationists wish to talk about `` fairness , '' something should be said about the fairness of having creationists author the two-model materials without consultation from evolutionists .<-->O
And should n't Hari Krishnas be allowed to author some two-model textbooks , and Day-Age theorists as well ?<-->N
Clearly , it is dishonest to falsely imply that -LRB- 1 -RRB- scientific opinion is equally divided on creation and evolution , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the case is equally good for both models , -LRB- 3 -RRB- there are only two models possible , -LRB- 4 -RRB- the evidence supports creationism , and -LRB- 5 -RRB- evolutionists believe absurdities .<-->O
Yet most creationist school materials make these implications .<-->N
Therefore , one can only conclude that the two-model approach , as now advocated , is not suitable for the public schools .<-->N
A Matter of Courtesy Besides honesty and quality of education , there is such a thing as courtesy .<-->O
Nell Segraves of the Creation-Science Research Center said in an interview , `` Most of the creation science is anti-evolution , showing the flaws in the evolutionary thinking . ''<-->N
This would seem to mean that creationism is mostly polemical attack and denunciation .<-->O
Such has been a common criticism leveled against creationist textbooks , particularly Biology : A Search for Order in Complexity .<-->O
Marvin Moore , a creationist writing in Liberty magazine -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , had this to say about the book : `` The three factors that raise a question about its appropriateness as a textbook in a public school classroom are its defense of Biblical creationism , sometimes with religious language ; its attempt throughout to discredit the evolutionary theory ; and its occasional belittling of scientists who believe in evolution . ''<-->O
- page 22 - Dr. Conrad Bonifazi , Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley , California said , `` The art of teaching itself is brought into disrepute by the introduction into it of denunciatory elements . ''<-->N
-LRB- 1972 . -RRB-<-->N
Since evolution is not taught in that way , why should creationism be ?<-->N
There are , however , non-creationists who would enjoy having the two model approach in the public schools .<-->O
Many of them are atheists and freethinkers who see such two-model teaching as an opportunity to `` debunk religion . ''<-->N
They want to bring back the good old days of the 19th century when orators like Robert Ingersoll criticized religion at large public gatherings and newspapers published the complete text of the speech the next morning .<-->O
They enjoy a good fight , and wish for another Darrow to battle another Bryan in a rousing fracas .<-->O
They feel such opportunities in the public schools will bring about a reduction in the effects of religion on society .<-->O
And there is a basis of validity in this .<-->N
After all , since the Bible is at bottom the basic source of creationist beliefs and the ultimate authority appealed to in every jam , then the Bible can not help but be part of the creation model .<-->O
Therefore , where the Bible makes testable claims , it would be fair in any two-model course to test them .<-->N
Where those claims do n't stand up to the test , religion based on them would be effectively `` debunked . ''<-->O
Is this desirable ?<-->N
A concern over such possible debate in the public schools led Herbert Stern -LRB- 1972 -RRB- of the University of California at San Diego to declare : The teaching of divine creation as a scientific theory demeans religion and I therefore oppose it .<-->O
For most people in this society religion is the highest form of spiritual expression which carries with it perceptions of truth that are unknown to the empirical searches of science .<-->O
To treat a religious vision of -LSB- origins -RSB- on the same footing as a scientific one is to drag religion into a spiritual gutter and to stimulate a fake conflict in the youngster between a system of thinking which has over the centuries sought to cultivate the loftiest of motivations and a system which has sought to bring meaningful order into the immediacies of human experience .<-->O
Any educational program which seeks to make these utterly different human concerns into a single and conflicting search for meaning is one which has declared bankruptcy in its own confidence .<-->O
A scientist who must prove the wisdom of evolution by arguing the absurdity of special creation is as unwelcome to me as the minister who must prove the wisdom of religion by citing the absurdities of science .<-->O
Zoologist Richard D. Alexander -LRB- 1978 -RRB- warned : `` When creation theorists strive to introduce creation into the classroom as an alternative biological theory to evolution they must recognize that they are required to give creation the status of a falsifiable idea that is , an idea that loses any special exemption from scrutiny , that is accepted as conceivably being false , and that must be continually tested until the question is settled .<-->O
A science classroom is not the place for an idea that is revered as holy . ''<-->N
- page 23 - Science Teaching Creationists , however , argue they will only be teaching the `` scientific '' creation model , not the religious one .<-->O
What many fail to remember is that most believers in creationism tie their whole religious value system to that very `` science . ''<-->O
Therefore their religious morals , sense of meaning in life , and many other things will rise or fall with the rise or fall of `` scientific '' creationism .<-->O
If this were not so , if creation `` science '' were not so important to creation religion , the creationists would not be making such vigorous moves in the direction of getting more religious schools to teach it , in addition to the public schools .<-->O
And Dr. Morris would not write statements of the type he does in his Director 's Column in Acts & Facts to wit : `` We do not know what the future may hold .<-->O
Unless the Lord returns first , however , we believe the case for scientific creationism is so sound that , by His grace , we may yet see a real nationwide reintroduction of creationism as a viable alternative into our schools and colleges .<-->O
The ultimate results , in terms of a revival of Biblical Christianity in our national life and in individual lives , are exciting to contemplate . ''<-->O
-LRB- 1974 . -RRB-<-->N
Some freethinkers find it exciting to contemplate too , as an opportunity to create a rise in atheism .<-->O
But Dr. Morris and other creationists are confident that the efforts to Christianize America will win out over the opposition .<-->O
Is this confidence well-placed ?<-->N
Yes , because equal-time teaching of creationism does n't end with just two model textbooks .<-->N
The next step is to demand that at least half the science teachers be creationists in a sort of `` affirmative action '' program for fundamentalism .<-->O
The Creation-Science Report , put out by the Creation Science Research Center , notes that efforts in this direction are already in progress .<-->N
1 , No. 2 -LRB- 1980 -RRB- says , `` Luther Sutherland has been working with the New York Board of Regents to have included questions on the creation model in the Board of Regents exam for teachers .<-->N
This would force a change in teacher training . ''<-->N
Mayer -LRB- 1978 -RRB- knew it all along .<-->N
`` A hidden premise is thus revealed .<-->N
If creationism is to be taught in science classrooms , then teachers must be trained to teach it not in a general or Christian sense , but in a manner acceptable to a small , fundamentalist minority .<-->O
It is not simply the textbooks that creationists strive to control , but teacher training as well . ''<-->N
-LRB- And , one might add , teacher certification . -RRB-<-->N
You see , the end result is the thing the creationists are concerned about , not just the process .<-->O
Morris has indicated in debate and in writing that an atheist or liberal Christian teacher would probably not do justice to the teaching of creationism or the two-model approach .<-->O
His opponents agree , in a way .<-->N
Biologist Richard Haas of Fresno State College -LRB- 1972 -RRB- put it plainly : `` Whatever the merits of creationist points of view such arguments clearly do not belong within the public schools except in courses devoted to theological subjects taught by persons specifically trained in these areas . ''<-->O
- page 24 - In other words , if creationists demand special teachers for creationism , let them be religious teachers , because science teachers are n't qualified to deal with this issue .<-->O
Stimulating Learning Richard Bliss of ICR , however , feels he has research to show that the two-model approach is ideal for science teaching .<-->O
He thinks teachers trained to use it will be better teachers and their students will be better learners .<-->O
He summarized his research in Impact No. 60 in the June , 1978 issue of Acts & Facts .<-->N
Let 's look at the data presented there .<-->N
Using the `` Pre-test , Post-test , Control Group '' design on high school biology students in Racine , Wisconsin , randomly divided into classes by computer , and using teachers all trained in two-model instruction who were equally divided in their preference for either creation or evolution , Bliss began his experiment .<-->O
Normal `` traditional '' material in Biology : Living Systems , by Oram , Hummer , and Smoot , was taught to the control group .<-->N
Origins : Two Models , Evolution / Creation , by Richard Bliss , was involved in the experimental group 's instruction .<-->N
The pre-test prior to the course showed no significant difference between the control and experimental groups .<-->N
Thus both started at basically the same level .<-->N
After the instruction , the post-test results showed a significant gain -LRB- at the .001 level -RRB- by the experimental -LRB- creation/evolution two-model -RRB- group .<-->N
They did better in learning both the evolutionary data and arguments , and those for creationism .<-->O
They had more positive attitudes toward the subject of biology in general .<-->N
Furthermore , `` those students in the experimental group in the middle and high IQ range showed a significant increase in preference toward the creation model after they had examined all the data .<-->O
In other words , they became more creationistic in their point of view and less evolutionary . ''<-->O
And finally , the two-model group `` seemed to develop more critical thinking habits than those who studied origins from an evolutionary model only . ''<-->O
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
It seems , then , that the student virtues inculcated by the Bliss two-model method are higher motivation , better grasp of the data , more ability and inclination to think critically , and more open mindedness , making students `` willing to change their views when new data arrive . ''<-->O
Dr. Jerry Bergman -LRB- 1979 -RRB- praised this study , adding that `` the strongest pedagogical argument for teaching both theories is that it permits comparisons and contrasts .<-->N
Teaching by contrasts helps the student to integrate new knowledge within the total framework of the subject .<-->N
Also , by teaching with an open-ended approach where problems are not solved or ` closed ' and students are left on their own , students are stimulated to continue searching . ''<-->N
- page 25 - To the average person , or school board member , this sounds highly desirable , and may even make it seem `` unconscionable from a pedagogical and scientific point of view , to teach only evolution to students in the public high schools . ''<-->O
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
But is the teaching of evolution alone really that backward ?<-->O
Let 's use some of the critical thinking Bliss praises and take a closer look at his study .<-->O
Bliss had two advantages which make his experiment unfair .<-->N
First , he designed the supposedly fair and balanced two-model teaching .<-->N
Second , his own two-model textbook -LRB- 1976 -RRB- was involved .<-->N
Apparently no evolutionists took part in either the training of the teachers in two-model instruction , or in the writing of the two-model textbook .<-->F
All this was done by Bliss , a creationist at Christian Heritage College .<-->N
Previously , I explained how creationist two-model instructional materials are unfair , imbalanced , and inaccurately portray evolution .<-->O
This is particularly true of Bliss ' two-model textbook used in his experiment .<-->N
It is no wonder , then , that more students became creationists after such a course of study !<-->N
Creationist two-model teacher training is probably no less inferior .<-->N
Richard M. Lemmon 's previously mentioned review of the teacher 's handbooks in the Science and Creation Series published by the Creation-Science Research Center , seems to clearly show this .<-->N
But there is another challenge possible .<-->N
Normal `` traditional '' material in biology , like that used by the control group , generally does n't put as much emphasis on origins as does creationist material .<-->O
This means a student getting a `` traditional '' biology education will know less about origins than one getting a two-model education .<-->O
We are thus forced to ask , is education in origins as all-important as the creationists make it out to be ?<-->N
And , if it is , what would be the results of more concentration on origins in the `` traditional '' curriculum ?<-->N
Surely , in this latter case , the control group would do much better than it did in Bliss ' experiment .<-->O
All the above points indicate that a new study may be necessary .<-->N
But this does not clear the air .<-->N
There is still the thought that a new experiment , of a fairer design , will still show a significant benefit for those learning under the two-model system .<-->O
Would any criticism then be possible ?<-->N
Dr. Bergman is quite correct in his advocacy of teaching by `` comparisons and contrasts . ''<-->O
This is why this has been done in textbooks on many subjects such as history .<-->N
Students get more involved when teachers inspire them to think for themselves rather than just memorize by rote .<-->O
But since when is it necessary to teach pseudo-science side-by-side with legitimate science in order to stimulate thinking ?<-->O
Since when is it necessary to give students the option of believing fallacies and misrepresentations of facts in order to get them to think ?<-->O
There are enough real and genuine controversies in science today without dragging in controversies from the 19th century , such as creationism .<-->O
- page 26 - Though students would certainly benefit from learning why creationism was rejected , there is no point in deceiving them into thinking it is a live scientific controversy today .<-->O
-LRB- It is indeed a live social and religious controversy today , which is why it belongs in comparative sociology or religion classes . -RRB-<-->O
Creationists are constantly citing scientists who challenge various aspects of evolutionary theory in the scientific journals .<-->N
Where these challenges are not outdated , they could be useful instructional tools for aiding students in the better understanding of evolution in particular and biology in general .<-->O
This material would supply the valuable `` comparisons and contrasts . ''<-->O
Controversy is part of science , and a necessary ingredient of its self-correcting operation .<-->N
Students should be made aware of this so they will learn to appreciate the primary virtue of science that creationists seek to obscure : namely , that science is not dogmatic and not a creed laid down in advance of the data .<-->O
Students should also work with the sorts of evidence and reasonings scientists use .<-->N
This will allow them to learn not only the facts , but the method of science .<-->O
Then , and only then , will they be ideally suited to forge new scientific revolutions in the future .<-->O
But to confuse students with generally rejected pseudo-science would not only be a waste of time , it could have harmful effects .<-->O
Students trust their teachers to deal in facts .<-->O
When teachers do not , or combine fact with fallacy in a mixed presentation , students can easily fall for the fallacy .<-->O
This was made clear in Scot Morris ' article `` Believing in ESP : Effects of Dehoaxing '' -LRB- 1980 -RRB- in which he deceived 80 % of the university students in his classes into believing in ESP by giving them a deceptive presentation of `` evidence . ''<-->N
Obviously , if creationism is legitimate science , students should have a fair chance to learn its evidence .<-->O
But if it is as nonsensical as Von Daniken 's `` ancient astronauts '' -LRB- which is not included in history studies that give alternate viewpoints -RRB- , it should be left out .<-->N
The consensus of knowledgeable scientists today , and the science articles published in Creation/Evolution , demonstrate why creationism should be left out .<-->O
Fundamentalist Christian Schools Still , creationists believe truth is on their side .<-->O
That is their right .<-->N
And they can therefore teach creationism as much as they please in the Christian schools .<-->O
But here is where we can test their sincerity .<-->N
Do creationists really believe two-model education is superior from a pedagogical standpoint ?<-->O
Do they really value the teaching of critical thinking ?<-->O
If so , then we would expect them to use only the two-model approach in the Christian schools .<-->N
We would expect them to set an example of `` fairness '' and `` balance '' so at least their students would have the opportunity to have their minds stimulated by this superior teaching method .<-->O
- page 27 - And , of course , Christian Heritage College , a division of which is the Institute for Creation Research , ought to be leading the way in this .<-->O
Dr. Gary Parker , Professor of Biology at Christian Heritage , explained in the Christian Heritage Courier of November 1979 how he teaches biology .<-->N
His article is entitled `` Bios-Logos : Bible-Based Biology '' ; here is part of what he had to say : In our introductory course -LRB- Biology 101 -RRB- , concepts and examples of `` skin in '' and `` skin out '' biology are presented as reflections of God 's power as Creator , Sustainer , Judge , and Redeemer ; and students are challenged to live as responsible stewards and ministers of God 's reconciliation ... Pathological processes -LRB- disease , aging , and death -RRB- are presented in terms of the Fall and our mandate following Christ 's example to bring healing and restoration wherever possible ... In Biosystematics , we contrast the evolutionary concept of species origin with the concept of variation within created kinds , and we try to give students the background and interest to proceed , should the Lord so lead them , with the development of a taxonomic system that will be true both to God 's Word and to God 's world , the twin criteria for true progress in science .<-->O
In other words , Dr. Parker teaches creationism , loading in the religious doctrine of the college , and brings up evolution only to knock it down .<-->N
But maybe this is because these college students have been `` brainwashed '' by evolution in the public schools before they get to the Christian college .<-->N
We need , then , to carefully examine the Creationist attitude toward Christian primary and secondary schools .<-->O
Scientific Creationism , edited by Henry Morris , is frequently sold to Christian secondary schools .<-->N
This is a book that gives only the Creation side of the question .<-->F
Christian schools are encouraged to use it as a central science text , supplemented only by general science material , not by books giving the opposite viewpoint .<-->N
In the September 1979 issue of the Christian Heritage Courier , Dr. Morris criticized the progressive education of John Dewey because it caused `` the concept of education from kindergarten to graduate school '' to be `` reoriented from the teaching of a fixed body of knowledge to the teaching of methods of inquiry to be applied to the continually changing facts of existence . ''<-->O
He noted that this concept of education was not always part of American education .<-->N
`` There was once a time when a search for truth could lead to truth !<-->O
... This meant , of course , that there were absolutes to be discovered , in both science and Scripture , and that man 's duty was to find and teach the truth in both . ''<-->N
Therefore , when progressive education came in , `` human experience and opinion , expressed democratically through the state , became the ultimate arbiter of ` truth . '' '<-->O
- page 28 - The result of all this was a rise in drug addiction and sexual promiscuity , not to mention the confusion and despair of existentialism .<-->O
Therefore : `` Today , the ideal of a wistful search for truth by a community of scholars operating in academic freedom has an air of unreality , to put it mildly , or futility , to put it bluntly . ''<-->O
To Morris , the solution is simple .<-->N
Bring back the Biblical-based education of the past .<-->N
After all , in its proper and primary role , `` education is concerned not with discovery of truth , but the transmission of truth already discovered . ''<-->O
Furthermore , `` true education is responsible under God for the transmission of truth - not the transmission of untruth !<-->O
True education is conservative ... '' -LRB- This last quotation was printed in red in the original . -RRB-<-->N
We ca n't forget , however , that some non-fundamentalist educators challenge aspects of progressive education too .<-->O
They favor more teaching of facts , and a `` back to basics '' approach .<-->O
But this is not all that Christian Heritage creationists are saying .<-->N
Neal Frey of the Department of History and Social Science at the college develops the idea further -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , leaving no doubt on where he stands .<-->O
He writes : Only two types of knowledge exist humanistic knowledge , whose view of being is not Christ-centered and whose center of value is nature or man , and Christian knowledge , whose views of origins and value are Biblical and Christ-centered ... `` Neutral '' knowledge does not exist .<-->O
There are no value-free facts , nor fact-free values : . . .<-->N
There can be no knowledge without values , no education without initiation into some value system .<-->O
From the standpoint of value , all education is moral training .<-->N
The momentous question is not , Shall education inculcate value ?<-->O
but , Shall education inculcate man-centered value or Christian value ?<-->O
... All branches of true knowledge are subdivisions of theology , dealing with various spheres of life under an absolute Trinity ... If students are merely exposed to rival systems of knowledge hence to mutually contradictory assumptions of value without having Christ-centered , Biblical truth rigorously defined , organized , and persistently brought to bear on the subject in question , those students will commonly select from each system the elements which to them seem most plausible , and will amalgamate them into a world view labeled `` Christian . ''<-->O
... Christian education should not insulate students from humanist scholarship .<-->N
It should keep humanism at bay , at arm 's length , while repeatedly and faithfully inculcating intellectually consistent Christ-centered knowledge based on scripture .<-->O
It should not deprive students of a truly Biblical liberal arts education by merely giving the Christian side `` equal time '' with humanism .<-->O
- page 29 - There it is .<-->N
The alleged education benefits of equal-time two-model instruction are not really accepted by creationist educators .<-->N
In fact they are rejected as inferior !<-->O
These further comments by Neal Frey show why .<-->N
Nor will Christian truth triumph in competition with humanist error in the disciplines ... The delusion that Christian truth could so triumph unaided is based on an unscriptural , over-optimistic reading of human nature .<-->O
It ignores original sin , which predisposes man against the truth .<-->O
Man has a vested self-interest in error and in the self-centered organization of knowledge ... Truly `` free thought '' is the liberty to think in Christ-centered terms .<-->O
Thought which has slipped out of militant subservience to Christian truth which has become man-centered is no longer free .<-->O
But in the current intellectual climate , humanist scholarship passes for enlightened free inquiry , while consistently Christian intellectual enterprise is stigmatized as `` biased '' and `` narrow . ''<-->O
Added to this Christian Heritage College seems to have rigid requirements in the hiring of teachers to go along with the above philosophy of education .<-->N
Dr. James J. Veltkamp , professor in Education at Christian Heritage lays it down -LRB- 1979 -RRB- : In the Christian school , college , or university , the instructor does not have the right to teach or publish without supervision .<-->O
-LSB- In red in the original . -RSB-<-->N
And when such supervision is exercised by the authorities appointed and empowered by God , that direction is not inconsistent with true liberty ... Let us not fall into the snare of much secular thinking about academic freedom which insists that there be no standard of faith and character , of doctrine or life , for faculty members ... We must also be alert and resolute to bar from our classrooms all those in the bondage of humanism who question the inerrancy of the Bible , who doubt the literalness and historicity of the first chapters of Genesis ... and who promulgate uniformitarian evolution under the sanctity of the adjective theistic .<-->O
Dr. Veltkamp , a challenger of what he calls `` intellectual libertinism '' minces no words : What right have these instructors to such academic freedom with its tremendous potential for influence ?<-->O
... Who supervises those thinkers and teachers to whom we entrust so much , while , in the name of academic freedom , safeguards are multiplied to free them from supervision ?<-->O
These questions themselves epitomize the monopolistic power of the national liberal-arts religion of secularism , with its mythological quest for the truth .<-->N
-LSB- Emphasis in red in the original . -RSB-<-->N
- page 30 - The illustration with this article includes a communist hammer and sickle under the words `` Academic Freedom . ''<-->N
A profile of Darwin is to the right of it .<-->N
This should leave no doubt that bringing creationism into the public schools is a straightforward effort to eventually remove evolution and bring dogmatism back into education .<-->O
Appeals to more stimulating education through the two-model approach are nothing but pretense .<-->O
Pleas for `` equal time '' are nothing but emotional ploys .<-->N
And the whole thing is just a stop-gap maneuver on the path to a far more radical solution .<-->O
Public Opinion Nonetheless , who can deny the public has strong opinions on this matter ?<-->O
Regardless of the legal , scientific , and educational issues , many people seem to want .<-->O
creationist doctrines taught in public school science classes .<-->N
Do n't their voices count for something ?<-->F
That these voices may be in a majority is indicated by a few polls which have been taken .<-->F
For example , in 1973 , a random survey was made of 1,346 homes in the Del Norte County Unified School District in California .<-->F
Residents were asked the question , `` Should evolution be taught in the public schools ? ''<-->N
The results were 58 % answering yes , 34 % answering no , and 8 % undecided .<-->N
When these same people were then asked , `` Should creation be taught in the public schools ? ''<-->N
89 % said yes , 8 % said no , and 3 % were undecided .<-->N
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
In the same year , creationists surveyed 1,995 homes in Cupertino , California and found that 44.3 % believed in creation , 23.3 % believed in evolution , 3.5 % believed in both , 10.6 % believed in neither , and 18.3 % were undecided .<-->F
When asked the question , `` Should scientific evidence for creation be presented along with evolution ? ''<-->N
84.3 % of these people said yes , 7.8 % said no , 6.3 % were uncertain , and 1.6 % said neither .<-->N
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 ; Weinberg , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
The Midwest Center of the Institute for Creation Research conducted a random telephone survey asking , `` Should evolution only , creation only , both evolution and creation or neither evolution or creation be taught in the public schools ? ''<-->F
The predictable answers came : 5.2 % saying evolution only , 18.9 % creation only , 64 % both creation and evolution , and 11 % neither .<-->N
Bliss -LRB- 1978 -RRB- concluded , `` While these data are limited , they nevertheless provide a good sampling of what adults feel is fair and proper for public schools . ''<-->O
Weinberg -LRB- 1978 -RRB- added in his article , `` Yet if these very limited investigations reflect anything like the actual situation as I believe they do then their results are a tribute to the poor job we have done in teaching evolution . ''<-->O
University students , as well as the public , seem to share this approval of two-model education in origins .<-->O
This was brought out in a paper published in Origins in 1979 by Jerry Bergman .<-->N
In reviewing the literature , Bergman noted the Christensen and Cannon survey of Brigham Young University students in the years 1935 and 1973 .<-->F
- page 31 - When given the statement , `` Man 's creation did not involve biological evolution '' in 1935 , 36 % of the students agreed .<-->F
But in 1973 , that figure jumped to 81 % .<-->N
When given the statement , `` The world 's creation did not take millions of years , '' the 1935 students gave only a 5 % favorable response while the 1973 students gave a 27 % favorable response .<-->O
Over 1000 students were used in each sampling .<-->N
Bergman also noted John C. Troost 's 1966 survey of secondary school biology teachers in Indiana .<-->N
This study `` showed that 173 out of 325 felt that evolution was a theory and not a fact , and 163 out of 330 thought that evolution should be presented as one of several alternative theories . ''<-->O
Bergman 's own study was conducted at Bowling Green State University in Ohio .<-->N
His subjects were 442 undergraduates in teacher-training programs and 74 graduate students taking courses in the area of biology .<-->N
The results were that 91 % of the undergraduate and 71.8 % of the graduate students felt that both models should be taught in the schools .<-->N
Bergman admits , however , that Bowling Green is a `` conservative '' school and that only 5 out of his total sampling of 516 were biology majors .<-->N
Yet , in spite of this , he maintained he was testing the `` assumption '' that `` the vast majority of teachers would opt for teaching only evolution '' and that his study helped demonstrate how `` a clear majority of both parents and teachers are in favor of the two-model approach to origins . ''<-->O
This conclusion was then used by him to question the opposition given to two-model teaching of origins in professional journals such as the American Biology Teacher .<-->N
Perhaps a survey of biology teachers , who are more knowledgeable in this area of science , should be taken to answer him .<-->N
But regardless of the shortcomings of these various surveys , the question remains , how are we to regard this public outcry concerning the scientific teaching of origins ?<-->O
One thing to be realized is that this outcry is part of an overall dissatisfaction with the public schools , and creationists have been effectively playing on that dissatisfaction .<-->O
It also comes at a time when considerable public pressure is being brought to bear against `` objectionable '' textbooks .<-->O
Mel and Norma Gabler in Texas challenge textbook selections every year .<-->N
TV evangelist Jerry Falwell feels that America is in a moral crisis .<-->O
`` For our nation this is a life-and-death struggle , and the battle line for this struggle is the textbooks . ''<-->O
-LRB- Park , 1980 . -RRB-<-->N
As a result , Judith Krug of the American Library Association notes that 300 reports of book-banning or censorship were received by that organization in 1979 , a number greater than at any other time in at least 25 years .<-->N
One example was the Anaheim , California school board which , under pressure , weeded out most of the works of William Shakespeare , Charles Dickens , and Mark Twain in the city schools .<-->N
- page 32 - The people have power , and can have whatever type of education they choose to vote for .<-->N
So the only response that can be given is that the public seems poorly informed on scientific matters , has not explored all the problems and ramifications of two-model teaching of origins gone into in this article , and is presently taking steps that seriously infringe on the constitutional protection of minorities from majority -LRB- or supposed majority -RRB- religious views .<-->O
It is not wrong to forthrightly declare the public is in error .<-->N
They have been wrong before .<-->N
Nor is it wrong to protect the integrity of science and science teaching from those who would impose public rule over matters of fact and evidence .<-->O
Creationists , however , do n't seem to respect science in this way .<-->O
Ariel A. Roth , editor of Origins , put out by the creationist Geoscience Research Institute at the Seventh Day Adventist College , Loma Linda University , had this to say in Liberty magazine -LRB- 1978 -RRB- .<-->N
`` Part of the problem is that evolutionists believe themselves to be the authority regarding the question of origins .<-->N
They hold that contents of textbooks and curriculum should not be left up to the public or legislative bodies , but to those with ` qualified professional judgment . '' '<-->O
He is promoting democracy here , but in a most anti-intellectual manner .<-->N
Carried to its logical conclusion , this would mean that if the public wants education , they should teach themselves , since Roth thinks they know what they want to be told , and hence must know what is true .<-->O
In view , then , of the public 's possible favoring of the two-model idea in education , is it right to say they should have it if they want it ?<-->O
It is more correct to say they will have it if they want it .<-->O
It is their choice .<-->N
And the only task remaining for scientists is to start educating the electorate before the people cut their own educational throats .<-->N
There is a freedom issue at stake here , too .<-->O
The two-model approach , with its obvious religious overtones , wo n't only bring religious issues into the science classroom , but possibly religious controversy .<-->O
Science teachers will , regardless of which side they are on , find it hard to keep their own religious views private .<-->O
Therefore , they will become marked men and women in the community if they are a minority .<-->N
Children will find themselves exposing their private beliefs during class discussions .<-->N
Creationists may or may not want it this way , but , in actual practice , that is what will most likely happen .<-->O
We must therefore ask the public if they support such invasion of privacy .<-->O
That the public might not really want two-model education is still a possibility .<-->O
At least some students are expressing their dissatisfaction with creationism being forced on them , and this is a good sign .<-->O
For example , when Nancy Leman , a junior college student at Palomar College in San Marcos , California , protested an evolutionary reference in her sociology book , a fellow student , Doreen Rabb , wrote the following letter to the San Diego Union shortly after the August , 1979 incident .<-->N
- page 33 - I and 40 other students had to sit through Nancy Leman 's constant interruptions as she tried to force her Christian 's view of life on the class .<-->N
I resent the lost class time spent trying to satisfy Ms. Leman 's uncalled-for comments .<-->O
Ms. Leman simply does not understand that the entire world is not Christian , and does not want to have religion thrown at them .<-->O
When I registered for sociology this summer , I was registering for a science class , not a religion class .<-->N
Perhaps if more students challenged creationism in this way , or lobbied for adequate education in the disciplines , the public might gain a better understanding of what is at stake .<-->O
Conclusion The American people are somewhat unique in the fervency with which they so often adhere to fundamentalist Protestant beliefs .<-->O
But this is a fact that can not be denied , and should not be left out of public education .<-->N
Material about the nature of various American , and perhaps world , religious beliefs ought to be presented to students .<-->O
Qualified instructors in this area should be sought .<-->N
It must be understood , however , that biology teachers are not so qualified , and the science curriculum is the wrong category in which to place religious , or religious based , material .<-->O
The Constitution makes a distinction between sacred and secular , and so should the public schools .<-->O
The public , of course , can have the matter any way they like it , but they should be aware of what each approach to education implies , and what some of the problems will be if one particular minority scientific or religious theory is brought into the science classroom .<-->O
They should try to understand that mixing religion with science confuses students about the nature of both .<-->O
They should be informed that there is no major controversy between scientists on creation and evolution , but that the controversy is mostly between scientists and nonscientists .<-->O
And they should realize that if creation is to be given equal time with evolution , astrology should be given equal time with astronomy ; astrology 's following being equal to that of creationism , and the theory being equally outdated .<-->O
Though education should promote critical thinking , it should do so in an overall context of passing on factual information .<-->O
Critical thinking is a tool , not the whole ball of educational wax .<-->N
A debating society is not a school , and mere exposure to variant opinions is not education .<-->O
The practical necessity of seeing to it that students are adequately prepared for possible careers in science should not be overlooked .<-->O
The teaching of pseudo-science as science does not further this aim .<-->N
- page 34 - If creationism were just another pseudo-science , however , there would n't be the pressure to have it taught .<-->O
Creationism has such force only because it is a religious theory , or is supportive of one .<-->O
People , therefore , have a larger emotional stake in seeing to it that it is included .<-->O
But this guarantees religious strife since there are so many creation theories , not to mention so many non-creation theories , related to origins .<-->O
Furthermore , there are various religious alternatives on history , geography , and most other courses of study .<-->N
To bring creationism in , then , would open up an explosive can-of-worms that would quickly endanger the constitutional guarantee of church-state separation .<-->O
It would also rob the educational system of valuable class time that should be devoted to imparting the knowledge of our day .<-->O
Creationists argue , however , that two-model education stimulates students .<-->N
No doubt it does , but religious pseudo-science is not the only possible educational stimulant .<-->O
Real controversies in science are far more preferable in this age of rapid scientific progress .<-->O
Furthermore , creationists do n't seem sincere about the educational advantages of two-model learning .<-->O
They do n't use it in their Christian parochial schools , and in fact claim it is inferior .<-->O
-LRB- An evaluation team from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges felt that Christian Heritage College practiced `` indoctrination '' not education , and that this would militate against accreditation of the college . -RRB-<-->O
Furthermore , ICR creationists successfully saw to it that a course at Iowa State University in `` critical judgement '' was terminated because it dealt critically with creationism -LRB- Zuidema , 1980 -RRB- .<-->O
Though creationists participate in a two-model course offered by Drs. Awbrey and Thwaites at San Diego State University , they have not promoted this in a manner consistent with their espousal of two-model education perhaps because instructors on the evolution side are also included , instructors who are competent at critiquing creationist beliefs .<-->O
Creationists want to write the textbooks and certify the teachers .<-->N
And though they push their creationist-controlled two-model teaching in all tax supported schools , colleges included , and demand equal time for creationism in all tax-supported institutions , such as the Smithsonian , their main emphasis is on the public secondary and primary schools .<-->O
This is because , there , creationists can more easily involve parents and play on religious sentiments .<-->N
School boards are far more accessible to public outcry because they are directly elected .<-->N
College boards of regents are often appointed .<-->N
Legislation affecting public schools is also easier to obtain than legislation affecting colleges or museums .<-->N
Public pressure is what the creationist movement is about , which is why creationists put such emphasis on public opinion polls that favor two-model teaching .<-->O
But scientific evidence is not determined by majority vote , a fact creationists hope the public will forget .<-->O
- page 35 - The promotion of two-model teaching in science by creationists then , seems only to be a way of getting Christian fundamentalist doctrines into the public schools to neutralize the effects that evolution teaching might be having on the spread of such fundamentalist beliefs .<-->O
It is also to `` win more souls for Christ . ''<-->N
Appeals to `` fairness '' and `` equal time '' are simply emotional ploys , and two-model textbooks are simply maneuvers .<-->O
The final aim is a triumphant creationism .<-->N
For one to espouse two-model teaching in science , one must ignore or be unaware of the educational havoc it will cause , the social problems , the legal complications , the effect on the quality of science , the effect on religious liberty , and the effect on academic freedom .<-->O
To still espouse such a view after all these facts are made clear requires a myopic narrowness of view and an incredible singleness of purpose unique to the business of professional religious pseudoscience .<-->O

---------------- 8Forum : Should Creationism Be Taught in Public Schools ?<-->F
Kerwin Thiessen Several years ago the Wichita Eagle-Beacon carried a story which reported the Flat Earth Society to be alive and well in modern America .<-->N
This select group of traditionalists have held tenaciously to the archaic notion that the earth is flat , not spherical .<-->O
Such a society reminds one of the self-proclaimed scientist who said , Don t confuse me with the facts .<-->O
My mind is made up !<-->N
In the most recent court battle concerning this issue , U.S. District Judge William Overton struck down Arkansas Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act by rejecting two state arguments that are crucial elements in this debate : 1 -RRB- that evolution is as religious as creationism , and 2 -RRB- that public schools should teach what the public wants .<-->O
In striking down the Arkansas law requiring schools to give a balanced presentation of both evolution and creationism Judge Overton stated , No group , no matter how large or small , may use the organs of movement , of which the public schools are the most conspicuous and influential , to foist its religious beliefs on others .<-->O
What about the question , Is evolution just as religious as creationism ?<-->N
My answer is , yes , because the system of evolution is , in its definition , a belief system .<-->O
Sir Julian Huxley , one of today s most respected evolutionists has defined evolution as a directional and essentially irreversible process occurring in time , which in its course gives rise to an increase of variety and an increasingly high level of organization in its products .<-->O
Our present knowledge indeed forces us to the view that the whole of reality is evolution a single process of self-transformation -LRB- What Is Science ?<-->O
p. 272 -RRB- .<-->N
I refer to such a definition because there is not a shred of scientific evidence to scientifically demonstrate Huxley s statement .<-->N
The definition of science shows that something is scientific only if it can be observed -LCB- 25 -RCB- and verified .<-->N
All must admit that it is impossible to prove scientifically any particular concept of origins , creationism or evolution .<-->O
No human being was there in the beginning to observe and verify how matter and life came into existence .<-->N
For nearly one hundred years evolution-as-a-dogma has been accepted and perpetuated in America s public educational institutions , and the proof of such a statement is seen in the almost universal acceptance of three sub-beliefs : 1 -RRB- faith in spontaneous generation of life substance , 2 -RRB- faith in transitional forms between different kinds of organisms , -LRB- unverifiable on the basis of anatomy , embryology , blood and protein analyses , fossils , or genetics -RRB- and 3 -RRB- faith in mutations as a source of raw materials by which supposed evolutionary changes in organisms might have come about in the past .<-->O
Each of these three sub-beliefs is dependent upon the other , as well as the very definition of evolution as given by Huxley .<-->O
And each of these statements is made without experimentally verifiable or observable scientific evidence .<-->N
The point is that both evolution and creationism are belief systems .<-->N
Both are embraced through believing what is unobservable rather than on the basis of what is scientifically provable .<-->N
I disagree with Judge Overton in striking down the Arkansas law on this basis .<-->O
He has closed his mind to the true definitions of science and religion .<-->N
Science deals with observable data .<-->N
Religion deals with belief and faith in the unobservable .<-->O
What about the matter of public education , i.e. , Should the public schools teach what the public wants ?<-->N
The First Amendment of the United States Constitution , Section One , states , Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .<-->O
Clearly the intent of our forefathers was that freedom prevail in all areas of civil life , education included .<-->O
Neither creationism nor evolution should be barred from the classroom where citizens of the republic desire that they be taught .<-->N
Should not public education be nonpartisan ?<-->N
Some students and their parents will place their faith in the belief-system of evolution when it comes to the study of origins .<-->O
Others will embrace creationism .<-->O
Both should be presented in the classroom where both are desired by the public .<-->N
The role of today s educator should permit such an approach .<-->N
The teacher used to be seen as a disseminator of knowledge , imparting to eager students the information and concepts they should know .<-->O
Today s teacher , however , is taught to be skilled in questioning techniques , -LCB- 26 -RCB- particularly in the disciplines of science and social science instruction .<-->O
This inquiry approach puts priority upon a presentation of data by the teacher coupled with thorough reading and experimentation by the student .<-->N
Such an approach is intended to be objective with the result of developing logical thought and decision-making skills among the students rather than reflecting the pre-conceived bias of the teacher .<-->O
Such skills as observation , classification , inferring , predicting , measuring , communicating , interpreting , formulating questions and hypothesis , experimentation , and formulating models , teach students to make critical observations when dealing with data .<-->N
It makes First Amendment sense to present students with all available data in their search for truth in any given area of study .<-->N
Especially in a free society , students must be allowed the academic freedom to pursue every viewpoint possible .<-->O
The most valid conclusion is always the one that best reflects all available data .<-->O
One certainly can not label our public schools as free-learning-centers when a most crucial area of study , i.e. , origins , is oppressed by state and federal legislation permitting only one viewpoint .<-->N
My answer to the question , Should creationism be taught in public schools ?<-->N
, is , therefore , Yes !<-->N
It should be allowed to be taught in those local school districts where students and parents embrace creationism and desire that it be taught by knowledgeable instructors .<-->O
My specific rationale for answering in this way is as follows : 1 .<-->N
The constituents of each local school district should determine the parameters of educational instruction for that district and that district only .<-->N
Since neither evolution nor creation is accessible to the scientific method , since they deal with origins , not presently observable events , both should be formulated as scientific models , or frameworks , within which the student can then predict and correlate observed facts .<-->O
Such scientific models can neither be proven nor tested , only compared .<-->N
Which model can explain , with the least amount of difficulty , the observable data in the real world ?<-->O
Evolution is a faith-system .<-->F
Creation is also a faith-system .<-->N
Both of these systems have far-reaching implications for the life , world-view , and morality of the adherent .<-->O
Both systems should be discussed in their entirety and presented as viable options .<-->N
Therefore , each is as religious as the other .<-->N
Each is as scientific as the other , as well .<-->F
Neither evolution nor creationism should be the only view presented in the public classroom if both views are desired by parents and students .<-->O
Henry Morris of Institute for Creation Research has -LCB- 27 -RCB- stated , and I agree , There are ... strong scientific and pedagogical reasons why both models should be taught , as objectively as possible , in public classrooms , giving arguments pro and con for each .<-->O
Some students and their parents believe in creation , some in evolution , and some are undecided .<-->N
If creationists desire only the creation model to be taught , they should send their children to private schools which do this ; if evolutionists want only evolution to be taught , they should provide private schools for that purpose .<-->O
The public schools should be neutral and either teach both or teach neither -LRB- ICR Impact , Vol .<-->N

You Ca n't Educate People Into Believing in Evolution If , as a great philosopher once said , `` life 's a bitch and then you die , '' what 's the point of debating about the existence of evolution ?<-->O
According to a new report by Calvin College assistant professor Jonathan Hill , many Americans do not think it 's that important to have the `` correct beliefs '' on the origins of human life .<-->O
His research was funded by the BioLogos Foundation , a pro-evolution , Christian organization founded by National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins .<-->N
`` It s important to know that a large portion of the population is unsure about their beliefs , and there is a large portion of the population that doesn t care , '' Hill said in an interview .<-->O
In a nationally representative survey of more than 3000 people , Hill divided respondents in the survey into `` creationists , '' `` atheistic evolutionists , '' `` theistic evolutionists , '' and `` unsure , '' but even creating four categories is tricky .<-->O
Under his definition , all `` creationists believe that God created humans as part of a single , miraculous act , '' but some think that happened within the last 10,000 years -LRB- often called `` young-earth creationists , '' -RRB- .<-->O
Others believe the earth has been around much longer -LRB- `` old-earth creationists '' -RRB- .<-->N
That group accounts for about 37 percent of the population ; another 16 percent accept the scientific evidence for evolution while still believing God was involved in creation in some way -LRB- or `` theistic evolutionists '' -RRB- ; 9 percent embrace evolution and reject God -LRB- or `` atheistic evolutionists '' -RRB- .<-->O
This leaves 39 percent who are unsure , or whose views do n't fit into the categories typically used to frame this issue .<-->O
And that matters .<-->N
For a long time , Gallup 's survey on evolution and creationism has been the standard for opinion data on this topic ; the organization 's 2014 `` Beliefs and Values '' survey suggested that 42 percent of Americans are creationists , 31 percent are theistic evolutionists , and 19 percent are atheistic evolutionists .<-->O
In his report , Hill argued that Gallup 's numbers are wildly misleading .<-->N
`` The difference between Gallup and -LSB- this survey -RSB- is almost certainly due to Gallup respondents being forced to choose from limited options , even when many are unsure of what they believe or maintain beliefs that do not fit into the options available , '' he wrote .<-->O
Plus , a lot of people just do n't care that much .<-->O
Hill found that 58 percent of respondents said this topic is only `` somewhat , not very , or not at all important '' to them .<-->N
People who held creationist views were the most emphatic about their beliefs ; 64 percent of that group said they care about being `` right , '' presumably in the metaphysical sense of rightness .<-->O
But that still means roughly a third of that group does n't care that much about cosmic correctness ; and among people with other views on evolution and creation , the apathy was much stronger .<-->O
Percentage of People Who Feel It 's Important to Be `` Right '' About the Origins of Human Life Even if people do n't personally care about being right , they do seem to care a lot about what 's taught in science classrooms , particularly in public schools .<-->O
Since the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision in the 1987 case Edwards v. Aguillard , there has been somewhat less controversy over teachers teaching creationism , said Josh Rosenau , the programs and policy director at the National Center for Science Education .<-->N
In that case , the justices ruled that `` the First Amendment doesn t allow schools to present one particular view over another .<-->O
If you explicitly talk about creationism , then someone can come after you , '' he said .<-->N
`` But there s a longstanding aspect of creationist rhetoric that is a two-model view of the world . ''<-->N
Teachers might present creationism and evolution as different explanations for the diversity of life on earth , for example , along with arguments for and against both ways of thinking .<-->O
`` If you weaken one -LSB- side -RSB- , it 's ipso facto an argument for the other , '' Rosenau said .<-->N
Even with the legal restrictions placed on teaching creationism in the classroom , many teachers still mention it in their lessons : A 2011 survey by Penn State professors Michael Berkman and Eric Plutzer found that 13 percent of high-school biology teachers across the country spend at least an hour on creationism each school year , while another 5 percent endorse it in passing .<-->O
An estimated 28 percent teach evolutionary biology according to the recommendations of the National Research Council ; the rest do n't advocate either view , '' -LSB- disassociating -RSB- themselves from the very material they 're expected to teach . ''<-->O
Often , this is because teachers want to avoid `` controversy , '' the authors write .<-->O
But all the anxiety around the origins of human life may partially be a matter of framing , Rosenau said .<-->N
`` No creationist wakes up in the morning and says , ' I have really strong opinions about whether Archaeopteryx is the ancestor of modern birds , ' '' he said .<-->O
* `` Who are we as people ?<-->N
That s the question that they think evolution is answering .<-->N
What does it mean to be a person ?<-->N
What does it mean to be an animal ? ''<-->N
In other words , the cliche of pitting science against religion is a category error , to a certain extent : Evolutionary biology provides certain insights into the mechanisms of how human life has formed and changed over time , but it ca n't provide insight into the meaning behind those changes .<-->O
Yet the meaning part is often what matters in vitriolic `` debates '' about the origins of life .<-->N
`` No creationist wakes up in the morning and says , ' I have really strong opinions about whether Archaeopteryx is the ancestor of modern birds . ' ''<-->O
The psychological need to see purpose , that is really interesting , '' said Jeffrey Hardin , a professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin , at the Faith Angle Forum in Miami on Tuesday .<-->O
Many Christians consider Neo-Darwinian theory to be dysteleological , or lacking in purpose . ''<-->O
Hardin is himself an evangelical Christian ; he often speaks with church communities about evolution in his work with the BioLogos Foundation .<-->N
In these conversations , he said , many evangelicals point to statements like that of paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson , who wrote in his 1967 book , The Meaning of Evolution , `` Man is the result of a purposeless and materialistic process that did not have him in mind .<-->O
He was not planned . ''<-->N
When this is echoed by outspoken atheists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris , Hardin said , `` Evangelicals look at it and go , I can t accept that , and therefore I can not accept thinking at all about evolutionary biology . ' ''<-->O
But ultimately , this may be what matters most for influencing Americans ' opinions on the origins of life .<-->O
In his report , Hill found that religious belief was the strongest determinant of people 's views on evolution much more so than education , socioeconomic status , age , political views , or region of the country .<-->O
More importantly , being part of a community where people had stated opinions on evolution or creation , like a church , had a big impact on people 's views .<-->O
`` Creationists are substantially more likely to belong to networks who agree with them about human origins , '' he wrote .<-->O
`` Likewise , creationists are more likely to belong to congregations who have settled positions that reject human evolution . ''<-->N
What that means is that `` debates '' about evolution and creationism actually might not be that effective .<-->O
`` For those invested in the position that human evolution is compatible with orthodox Christian faith , the findings from -LSB- this survey -RSB- tell us that persuasion needs to move beyond a purely intellectual level , '' Hill wrote .<-->O
`` Ideas are important , but ideas only persuade when individuals are in a social position that allows them to seriously consider what is before them . ''<-->O
For those who value the widespread acceptance of evolution , this is an important insight : There may be more effective ways to persuade people to consider principles of biology without trying to debunk the existence of God .<-->O
`` This is the century of biology , and evolution is the foundation of biology , '' Rosenau said .<-->N
`` Being open to those conversations is really important for scientists . ''<-->O
As for those who are concerned with being cosmically correct , like the hardcore creationists or the Richard Dawkinses of the world , there may not be many options available by way of persuasion .<-->O
Classroom discussions are n't the most important factor in shaping people 's views , and many people are either unsure or do n't care about being right .<-->O
It seems that most people simply believe what they 're going to believe about the metaphysical nature of the universe .<-->O

Should Creationism Be Taught in the Public Schools ?<-->N
1 erefore it would be unfair to select any particular one and teach that one as the truth .<-->O
-LRB- Plantinga 1998 -RRB- But this argument is seriously flawed ; even if there is no way for everyone to eat the whole pie , it does not follow that there is no fair way to divide it or even to pick just one person who will get it .<-->O
Plantinga appeals to the Rawlsian analysis of justice , but does not describe the reasons 11 As noted earlier , Professor Plantinga s paper was a commentary upon mine and was also read at the December 1998 Association for Philosophy of Education meeting .<-->N
All the quotations in this section are from the written version of that paper , which Professor Plantinga kindly provided me so I could write my reply .<-->O

11 , No. 2 , pp. 111-113 .<-->N
March 2002 -RRB- that he thinks would lead free and equal people in Rawls s Original Position to agree to such a basic right .<-->O
We need to see this reasoning before we can evaluate the justice of the proposal from a Rawlsian perspective .12 Perhaps he thinks that it would go something like this : One knows that people are likely to disagree about comprehensive beliefs such as those profound religious beliefs about God and God s methods of Creation , but under the veil of ignorance one does not know what one s own view will be on such matters or whether , say , one would be in a position see to it that only those beliefs were taught in the schools .<-->O
Plantinga must think that under such conditions rational persons would agree to institute -LRB- BR -RRB- as a defensive safeguard since no one could be sure that their own preferred view would be taught , they all would want at least the right to see to it that another view that opposes it not be taught either .<-->O
In other words , I supposedly would reason as follows : since I might be a creationist whose epistemology tells me that true knowledge comes only from the Bible and that evolution is contrary to God s Truth , I would want the right to exclude evolution from the schools to protect my children from what I would take to be its evil influence .<-->O
But this reasoning is surely mistaken .<-->O
Rational agents would never agree to such a gag rule as a basic right for a variety of reasons .<-->O
First , to do so would be to gut the curriculum , for even the most well-established facts may threaten some element of some person s comprehensive beliefs .<-->O
As we saw , creationists comprehensive beliefs put them at odds with not just the facts of 12 According to John Rawls influential view , justice in a pluralistic democracy is a function of fairness , with fairness understood in terms of fair procedures .<-->O
-LRB- Rawls 1971 -RRB- The Original Position is an abstraction of such a procedure in which we are to imagine ourselves as rational persons who are contracting to form what will be the basic social institutions , while under a veil of ignorance that prevents our knowing in advance what position we will hold in that society once it is constituted .<-->O

March 2002 -RRB- evolutionary biology , but also with the findings of most other sciences .<-->N
Furthermore , because of the interconnections among scientific theories , opposition to what might appear to be just a single finding , necessarily involves opposition to many other ones as well .<-->O
Nor are creationists the only ones that would make use of -LRB- BR -RRB- ; there are thousands of special interests groups that would use such a right to prohibit the teaching of specific facts or even whole subjects they objected to .<-->O
One does not have to look far to find parents who would object to teaching about racial equality , the facts of reproductive health , or that even that the earth is round .13 Only the utterly trivial could have a chance of escaping the gag of -LRB- BR -RRB- .<-->O
No rational person would agree to such a policy .<-->O
Plantinga tries to avoid this conclusion by suggesting that we could teach things hypothetically .<-->N
That is , while we could teach no account of creation as fact , we could teach them all conditional upon their specific epistemic base -LRB- EB -RRB- .<-->O
On this proposal , presumably a teacher would have to include a list of hypotheticals , along the lines that If one starts with EB-YEC then God created the world and human beings 10,000 years old ; If one starts with EB-Ra l , then extra-terrestrials created human beings by genetic engineering hundreds of thousands of years ago and so on .<-->O
But this has similar problems .<-->N
Though more people might accept this kind of hypothetical teaching , no doubt there would remain a significant number who would still object to having their children exposed to such ideas even hypothetically .<-->O
On the other hand , even if we supposed that no parent would exert BR , rational agents would still reject the proposal in that it would 13 On biblical authority , schools in Zion , Illinois around the time of the Scopes trial not only rejected evolution , but also Modern Astronomy and its infidel theories of a moving , round earth .<-->O
See -LSB- Schadewald , 1989 # 2079 -RSB- for a description of how the flatearth view persisted in Zion schools until the mid-1930s , and continues to have a few adherents even today .<-->N

11 , No. 2 , pp. 111-113 .<-->N
March 2002 -RRB- have the complementary problem rather than gut the curriculum , it would balloon it to absurd proportions in that teachers would have to present a huge series of antecedent comprehensive beliefs -LRB- potentially every parents specific EB -RRB- , followed by the relevant consequents for each , again for all but the most trivial issue .<-->O
Second , under the veil of ignorance one should not limit one s deliberations to the scenario in which one was a parent with a comprehensive belief that he or she did not want challenged .<-->O
The rational person would also have to think about being a child growing up in the household of such a parent .<-->O
Sadly , we all know parents who are bigots or ideologues and others who are simply narrow-minded or ignorant .<-->O
A good education may be a child s only window to a clear picture of the world and to an open future .<-->O
To agree to -LRB- BR -RRB- would be to close that window .<-->O
This would be a serious harm for the children of such parents .<-->O
It would harm other children as well , all of whom could be deprived of a decent education , because the public schools could be forced to omit even basic scientific facts , simply because some parent found them offensive to his or her private religious beliefs .<-->O
Indeed , it is difficult to think of any substantive fact that could pass unchallenged , if we grant with Plantinga that each person may appeal to -LRB- BR -RRB- from the warrant of her personal epistemic base -LRB- EBP -RRB- .<-->O
Judging the question after considering the points of view of both parents and children , rational persons in Rawls Original Position would reject -LRB- BR -RRB- .<-->O
Thus , a school policy that ignores -LRB- BR -RRB- is not unjust , for -LRB- BR -RRB- itself is unjust .<-->O
So , what would rational agents agree to ?<-->O
They would assent , I believe , to something very similar to our current system , along the lines I mentioned above a separation of the public and the private .<-->O
They would require that public institutions , like the public schools , not teach views based upon private epistemologies such as special revelation , because one can not rationally adjudicate among beliefs that different persons purport to know simply as a Christian or a Hindu , a Ra lian , a Pagan , or whatever .<-->O
Rational agents would agree to a basic right to hold such beliefs privately , but as a R. T. Pennock Should Creationism Be Taught . ?<-->O

Instead they would require that public institutions be constrained to public knowledge .<-->N
In teaching about the empirical world , this means that the schools should limit their science curriculum to scientific findings testable conclusions that we can rationally draw on the basis of observational evidence and the methodological assumption of natural law .<-->O
Although for such reasons I am afraid we can not stomach the main entr e that Plantinga offers , perhaps we may still at least break bread together in another way .<-->O
While we can not agree that we should teach creationism even conditionally , we can agree that we should not teach science -LRB- including evolutionary theory -RRB- dogmatically .<-->O
Scientific truths are never more than approximate , and always come attached with some greater or lesser degree of likelihood that depends upon their evidential support .<-->O
While it may be reasonable to teach well-confirmed findings as sober truths , scientists must always remain cognizant that even these might have to be revised should new evidence appear that undermines their support ; even settled truths may not legitimately be put forward as being absolute .<-->O
The good science teacher will point this out .<-->O
This is not the same as teaching science conditionally , as though its epistemic base were no better or worse than any private epistemology ; rather it is just a straightforward acknowledgment of some features of its methodology .<-->O
Knowing the rational limits of science , the rational person would agree not to have it portrayed as something it is not .<-->O
It is not a religion and should not be taught as one .<-->N
Its findings are trustworthy , but they are not dogma .14 Teaching science simply as a set of facts to be memorized can make it seem like a catechism , but teach science properly , by also teaching its methods of investigation , and dogmatism will 14 See -LRB- Siegel 1984 , pp. 359-362 -RRB- for a rebuttal of the creationist claim that teaching evolution amounts to indoctrination .<-->O

Creationists and others who hold to some private epistemology may still teach in their homes and churches that man does not live by bread alone , but surely the reasonable and just compromise is to agree that in the public schools we should content ourselves with sharing science s simple , basic fare .<-->O
THE ANSWER In reviewing the arguments , we find many good reasons for excluding creationism from the schools , and few good reasons for not doing so .<-->O

The answer is that it should not .<-->F
1.6 things you should understand about stay-at-home moms During a speech in Rhode Island last week , President Barack Obama made a statement some interpreted to mean he did n't want women to choose to be stay-at-home mothers , according to Lois Collins of Deseret News National .<-->O
`` Sometimes , someone usually mom leaves the workplace to stay home with the kid , which then leaves her earning a lower wage for the rest of her life as a result .<-->N
And that 's not a choice we want Americans to make , '' Obama said Friday in his speech .<-->N
But do n't worry , stay-at-home moms aren t going anywhere , despite the debate over Obama 's statements .<-->O
According to the Pew Research Center , 29 percent of mothers don t work outside the home , which is up from 23 percent in 1999 .<-->N
And some stay-at-home wives have been commended for helping America become what it is today .<-->N
According to The American Enterprise Institute s Charles Murray , they promote social goods that help build communities and neighborhoods , like attending PTA meetings , promoting youth sports and ensuring the neighborhood is safe by keeping an eye on each other s houses when no one is home .<-->O
Murray said working women often provide positivity and goodness , too , and they often get a lot of the praise since they re balancing work and home lives .<-->O
But stay-at-home wives , specifically , should be acclaimed for their continued efforts to keep their communities safe .<-->O
I just want us to realize that stay-at-home wives are one of the resources that have made America America , Murray wrote .<-->O
It is entirely understandable that some wives work full time , either for the fulfillment of a vocation or to make money the same reasons men work full time .<-->O
But when either partner in a marriage and it will usually be the wife chooses to devote full time to being a parent and neighbor instead , that choice should not just be accepted , but celebrated .<-->O
While stay-at-home moms help the community , what else are they doing in today s society to help their children and their families ?<-->O
Here are six things you should understand about stay-at-home moms .<-->N
Stay-at-home moms shape their children into who they are .<-->N
According to Focus on the Family s Jill Savage , stay-at-home mothers create a stable home , where they teach their children to understand who they re going to be in the future and what it is they value .<-->O
Raising a good child begins in the home , and it s the stay-at-home moms who create the environment in that home , Savage wrote .<-->N
Home is where a child learns who they are , Savage wrote .<-->F
Each of us is created uniquely by God .<-->F
We have unique gifts , talents and temperaments .<-->N
Home is the place those are discovered and celebrated .<-->N
Stay-at-home moms are better off financially .<-->N
Stay-at-home moms are well-educated and have the potential to work outside the home , but would rather raise their children to help save on day care costs , according to a report from the Pew Research Center .<-->O
Day care costs have risen so high that the only way to afford it would be for both parents in a household to work , Pew reported .<-->O
That s why in general , married stay-at-home mothers are better off financially than their counterparts who are single or cohabitating , the Pew report found .<-->N
The report said they make choices to save on costs that single people don t make .<-->N
And stay-at-home mothers are usually married to a high-earning husband who covers both of their expenses .<-->N
Stay-at-home parents make their kids smarter .<-->N
Stay-at-home parents make their older kids smarter , according to a study from the Statistics Norway Research Department .<-->N
The study looked at the effects of Norway s Cash for Care program which gave money to parents who wanted to care for and educate their children at home , rather than send them to early education and how the beneficiaries children did later on in school compared to those who did not receive money from the program .<-->O
The study ultimately found that children whose parents did the Cash for Care program so , staying at home and raising their children got better test scores and better GPA averages than those who didn t. Those same stay-at-home parents are often sources of counsel and insight for their children when they grow older , too , the study said .<-->O
The results suggest that even older students in middle or elementary school could use guidance from their parents , Eric Bettinger , the study s researcher , told Quartz .<-->O
For years , we have known that parental presence is extraordinarily important in the very early childhood years .<-->O
What we re finding is that parents continue to be important much further along in a child s life than we had previously thought .<-->O
Stay-at-home moms are worth $ 117,000 a year .<-->N
How often does someone tell you that you re worth six figures ?<-->N
Well , according to a study cited by Fox News , stay-at-home moms are worth about $ 117,000 a year .<-->N
The study looked at the pay of 10 different jobs that require workers to perform the same tasks as a stay-at-home mom like cleaning , teaching and community building and the total came out to be $ 116,805 .<-->N
When the same study was done on working moms , it found their worth to be $ 68,405 .<-->N
`` I think a lot of people think we sit at home and have a lot of fun and do n't do a lot of work , '' said Samantha Russell , a New Hampshire mother of two , to Fox News .<-->O
`` But they should try cleaning their house with little kids running around and messing it up right after them . ''<-->O
Stay-at-home moms keep their kids thin .<-->N
Researchers from the University of Minnesota found that positive family dinners make children thinner .<-->N
The study said this was particularly true in cases where fathers were present at the table .<-->N
But maybe mom should be there , too , since when mom works , children gain weight .<-->O
That s the findings of a study from the journal Child Development cited by CNN .<-->N
The study found a slight increase in a child s weight when both their parents worked .<-->N
While this isn t necessarily a widespread trend , the findings did reveal something about the potential eating habits of working families , according to CNN .<-->O
Working mothers could be pressed for time , which could cause them to turn to fast food and restaurants , CNN reported .<-->O
Stay-at-home moms are happier with their lives .<-->N
That s right stay-at-home moms believe they have more worthwhile lives , at least according to data from the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom .<-->O
The Telegraph reported that the ONS found the people in Britain who reported being the happiest were mothers who stay home to raise their children .<-->N
The research said that stay-at-home mothers well-being is increased by their children , since they get joy out of raising their children and seeing them happy .<-->O
Workers are concerned about the economy and their jobs , which increases their stress levels , the research found .<-->O
This just goes to show that the idea that we are all at home depressed and unhappy looking after our own children which a lot of politicians would like to believe is simply wrong , said Laura Perrin , a mother , to The Telegraph .<-->O
Hard Choice for Moms : Work or Stay Home ?<-->N
Mothers with the financial means have long had the choice to go back to work or stay home after the birth of their children .<-->N
Today , however , more moms in all economic levels appear to be considering the stay home option - at least that 's what some experts suspect when they point to recent population surveys , which show all female employment numbers declining after decades of sustained growth .<-->O
`` The employment decline is apparent among all income groups , roughly equally , '' says Philip Cohen , PhD , associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .<-->N
Employment figures for married mothers with children under age 6 have dropped 7 % to 10 % since the peak years of 1997 to 2000 , depending on the income group , says Cohen .<-->N
Overall , the work participation rate for all women dropped 1.5 % from 2000 to 2004 , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .<-->F
This is significant because , for four decades , women 's labor participation rates consistently climbed , from 40.8 % in 1970 to 57.5 % in 2000 .<-->N
The phenomenon caused profound changes in American family , culture , and economy .<-->N
The shift in direction has some people wondering whether or not the sexual revolution at work is over and what may have caused the change .<-->N
What Are the Advantages of Mothers Staying at Home With Their Kids ?<-->F
While many mothers are in today 's workforce , some out of necessity and others by choice , have chosen to stay at home to care for their children .<-->N
There are many advantages to being available to your youngsters at all times .<-->N
Mary Eberstadt , an advocate of stay-at-home parenting and author of `` Home-Alone America : The Hidden Toll of Day Care , Wonder Drugs , and Other Parent Substitutes , '' argues that `` institutional care is a bad idea for parents who do have a choice because it raises the quotient of immediate unhappiness in various forms among significant numbers of children . ''<-->O
Consistent Discipline and Care Children enrolled in daycare and then later in school must become accustomed to a variety of discipline styles .<-->N
Some teachers are more lenient than others .<-->N
Others have very strict rules and guidelines for the children to follow .<-->N
This can confuse youngsters to have to `` read '' their caregivers and teachers as to how they should conduct themselves .<-->N
When children stay home with a parent , the parent has consistent rules and consequences .<-->N
When a child is ill , the child knows who will care for him .<-->O
The parent can easily make doctor and dental appointments without worrying about taking time off from work .<-->N
Familiar and Safe Surroundings Children who have a stay-at-home parent are always surrounded by a familiar environment .<-->N
They know where their toys and books are .<-->N
They do n't have to ask to get a drink of water or to go to the restroom .<-->N
They sleep in their own beds at naptime instead of a mat on the floor .<-->N
Having familiar and safe surroundings gives children comfort and security in their day-to-day lives .<-->O
No Travel Time Children who stay at home do not have to worry about catching a daycare bus or being shuttled between childcare facilities and school .<-->N
Mom may decide to take them to the zoo , shopping , or on other excursions but these are not normal , scheduled trips .<-->N
This reduces the risks of accidents and becoming separated from your child .<-->N
A stay-at-home mom may even reduce the number and/or expense of extra autos for the family .<-->N
Few Childcare Expenses A stay-at-home mom will not have the heavy childcare expense that most working mothers have to deal with .<-->O
Granted , the loss of one income can be monumental but if there are several children in the household , sometimes it is less expensive for one parent to stay at home to care for the children , especially if they are small .<-->O
Other than the occasional social night out , there is no need for expensive childcare workers or babysitters .<-->O
Mothers will not have to purchase work clothes , gasoline , bus fare , lunches or office supplies 4 .<-->N
To stay or not to stay at home To work or stay home that 's a decision many women need to make when they 've had a baby .<-->O
To ensure that their child is well taken care of , many mothers choose to stay home .<-->O
On the contrary , a study by American Psychological Association points out , working mothers may actually be the ones who are better off at raising children when compared to those who stay at home .<-->O
The study also reported that working mothers enjoyed better health , lesser signs of depression and contributed more to a child 's overall learning opportunities .<-->O
The ladies in Pune voice their opinions on the same .<-->N
Not true Stay-home mums are the ones who have to let go of their ambitions and desires in order to take care of their child , say a few .<-->N
Actor Manini Mishra says , `` The mother who stays home instead of working sacrifices her aspirations and career to ensure that her child is well taken care of .<-->O
It is not easy to stay home , look after the house and also take care of the child . ''<-->O
Manini feels that stay-home mums contribute as much as a working mother does or perhaps even more Absolutely right Women are known to be good at multitasking , point out others .<-->O
Multi-tasking directly relates more efficiency .<-->N
Actor Poonam Dhillon explains , `` Working women are always more capable and are good at multi-tasking .<-->N
Working mums put in a lot more effort to ensure they get to spend some quality time with their children too .<-->N
This contributes to the overall development of the child . ''<-->N
SOS Mummy !<-->N
Actor Smita Jaykar feels that stay-home mums make their children dependent on them for everything .<-->N
She explains , `` Stay-home mums tend to spoon-feed their children .<-->N
This curbs their independence . ''<-->N
Smita also says she finds that her children are a lot more independent than most kids their age .<-->N
Not applicable A few others are of the opinion that since these studies are conducted abroad , they have no relevance in India .<-->N
Actor Renuka Shahane stresses on the health aspect .<-->N
`` This study does not hold good for the women in India .<-->N
Whether a woman is working or not working , her work pressure remains the same .<-->N
In the west , once women are back home , they relax and rejuvenate .<-->N
That is not the case here .<-->N
A woman has to handle so many more things here , and that could lead to a lot ofstress , '' she explains .<-->N
Work is happiness Personal happiness is always a driving force while taking crucial decisions , feel others .<-->O
Actor Manjari Phadnis elaborates , `` The mothers who stay at home tend to centre their lives around their children .<-->N
Working mothers , on the other hand , learn to manage home and career and do both well .<-->N
And managing them both gives them a sense of accomplishment . ''<-->N
Do n't worry , be happy Film-maker Chitra Palekar feels that is ` no such thing as this is better than that ' .<-->O
`` If you are able to spend quality time with your child , then nothing like it .<-->N
Being happy and the providing the space your child needs is the way to go about it . ''<-->N
As long as both the mother and child are happy , it is bound to contribute to the growth of the child .<-->O
Why is it suddenly taboo to say mother should stay at home with their babies ?<-->N
My most vivid memory of my childhood is hovering outside our smart Kensington sitting room , which I was forbidden to enter , as my mother , a dressmaker , fitted garments to a series of rich clients .<-->O
Just a minute , darling , she d say on the rare moments she popped out to get some more pins , in answer to any query of mine .<-->N
In a minute .<-->N
We ll see .<-->F
And somehow my request would get forgotten , always second place to her work .<-->N
My mother always had scant interest in me as a child and I was brought up pretty much entirely by au pairs until I was eight , after which I was left to fend for myself .<-->O
True , my father was sometimes around , and what a wonderful father he was .<-->N
But it wasn t the same .<-->N
Father was working himself , teaching life-drawing at the Royal College of Art .<-->F
It was my mother I wanted .<-->N
I was an only child and I wanted her to make my tea , to care for me , show an interest .<-->O
Not always , just sometimes .<-->N
That s not to say Mother was all bad .<-->N
If she had been a slightly distracted older friend or relative , she would have been fine .<-->O
But as a mum ?<-->N
I m afraid she wasn t much good .<-->O
By the early Sixties , her neglect of me had deepened .<-->N
By now , Mother was really interested only in her career .<-->N
Indeed , she had been made Professor of Fashion at the Royal College of Art , a post so unusual for a woman that it merited a front-page story in the Daily Express .<-->N
Then , when I was 13 and after a series of pretty serious rows between her and my father , she left home for good .<-->O
Father and I had to fend for ourselves My childhood had been so dreadful , and I felt my mother s neglect so deeply that , to be honest , it was a bit of a relief when she left .<-->O
At least I knew she was gone for good none of this halfway house , being there one moment , abandoning me the next , which made me feel so insecure , so unstable .<-->O
These are the memories I draw upon in my role as an agony aunt .<-->N
And whenever I am asked about working mothers , I remember myself sitting outside that living room for hours on end , kicking my heels against the chair on which I sat , desperate for some attention from Mother .<-->N
I thought of that sad scene last week , when I received a letter from a young pregnant woman who had just been headhunted by a top firm .<-->O
They wanted her to start work as soon as possible .<-->N
Should she hand the baby over to her husband as soon as it was born , she asked ?<-->N
He was happy to be a house husband .<-->N
She was keen to do it , but her friends had advised her not to .<-->N
What did I think ?<-->N
As an agony aunt of more than 40 years , I ve often had letters on these lines and my reply has been the same , as it was last week .<-->N
Don t go back to work straight away .<-->N
Give the baby a chance to bond with you , for just a few months of your time at the very least , to give it a firm footing in life .<-->O
Of course , you should stay home .<-->N
A child needs its mother certainly for the first precious months .<-->O
But my answer was met with waves of abuse .<-->N
I was accused of not being a feminist .<-->N
I was mad .<-->N
I was a relic from another time .<-->N
It s time to kick this agony aunt to the kerb , wrote one blogger .<-->O
She declared that my advice was kneejerk Fifties backwash which reeked of vestiges of another time .<-->N
People emailed me personally .<-->N
Your advice patronises and belittles the role of both parents , wrote one .<-->N
You show no knowledge or compassion for the role that a parent performs for a baby .<-->O
Another damned me for writing a biased , patronising , parent-hating piece .<-->O
The furore took off online , spread to Radio 4 s Today programme , where I attempted to defend myself , and has since been the subject of fierce debate .<-->O
It s all been rather enlightening , to put it mildly .<-->N
It s shown me just how much the landscape has changed for working mothers today .<-->O
When I was young , mothers were made to feel guilty for going back to work at any time during their child s formative years .<-->O
But these days women are made to feel guilty if they don t go back to work straight after having a baby .<-->O
One young mum who visited me recently with her nine-month-old said she was made to feel awful by her contemporaries for staying at home with the baby .<-->O
People were always asking when she was going back to work .<-->N
But , as she pointed out , she d found there was nothing as fulfilling and absorbing as looking after a baby .<-->N
Although it was more demanding , it was far more interesting and fulfilling than her job , and beat working in an office hands down .<-->N
Indeed , the reasons I set out for encouraging the mother to stay with her baby for a year were simple and , I thought , reasonable .<-->O
This little mite would have been living inside its mum s body for nine months and , like all babies , would be extremely bewildered and disturbed to leave the comfort of her cosy womb into a world outside .<-->O
Having your mum around closely for the first few months of life , rather than being left in the sole care of your father , effectively a complete stranger , is crucial .<-->O
Lord knows I felt the full force of this myself , when my mother effectively abandoned me for her career .<-->O
The memory of the loss of my mother for it was a loss , as profound as any grief has shaped my own parental style , too .<-->O
I simply refused to leave my son Will , who is now a father himself , and managed to sneak in hours as a freelance writer when he was asleep .<-->N
I didn t want my baby to feel the neglect I did .<-->O
But , more than this , I didn t want to break the instinctive , intuitive connection with my child .<-->O
All devoted mothers will know what this feels like .<-->O
Not long after my son was born , I remember having a party for a few friends at home .<-->N
As he lay in a carrycot on the other side of the room , I had the all - powerful feeling that a piece of myself was lying over there .<-->O
I couldn t bear to be separated from him for even a few minutes that was my flesh and blood over there .<-->N
It was the most extraordinary experience , and I couldn t get enough of it .<-->O
But while my husband was totally besotted by our little chap from day one , there certainly was no such personality sea-change in him .<-->O
Obviously , there are times a mother must be separated from her child .<-->N
And if a women tragically dies in labour , I m sure any father would do a brilliant job of raising baby .<-->O
But if there was a choice , how many of us could argue against the intrinsic , biological bond between mother and child ?<-->O
Isn t the kindest , most humane and positive approach to let baby be around you , Mummy , with your familiar smell , sound and touch ?<-->O
Shouldn t you gradually ease him or her into a brand new life until they are old enough to fully comprehend that dad is just as much home as mum ?<-->O
In my full advice to the pregnant woman who asked if she should go straight back to work , I said once the baby was old enough to feel just as secure with its father as with its mother , she could go back to the office if she could bear to do so .<-->O
Indeed , most mums feel a real tug to stay with their children for longer than a year .<-->O
Indeed , many can t bear to give up the job of mothering until the child actually leaves home .<-->N
No wonder , then , that in a study of national happiness it was found stay-at-home mothers are more likely to think their lives are worthwhile than women who go to work .<-->O
They tend not to suffer from boredom , frustration or feelings of worthlessness .<-->O
They certainly won t ever feel that regret that some career women may well experience when they look back and realise that , however much they love their children when they re older , they ll never be able to re-capture those rapturous early months with their baby .<-->O
Despite the maelstrom of criticism I have received , my thoughts aren t anti-women .<-->N
I m not anti-women working .<-->N
I m not anti-men , or anti-parent or even anti-feminist .<-->N
I am one thing : entirely pro-child .<-->N
After all , it is the helpless little child who is the one who is most often ignored when we begin to shout about women s rights .<-->O
So despite the criticism , despite the brickbats of the past week , I still feel the same as I ever did .<-->O
When I hear of mothers going straight back to work after having a baby , I wonder , if they can t bring themselves to look after their tiny , helpless baby in those precious early days , why on earth do they bother having children in the first place ?<-->O
Should mothers stay at home to raise their children ?<-->N
In today s society , women often feel that to be seen as successful , they should have to balance their career , children and their marriage .<-->O
For many families , going back to work , after the birth of a child is a necessity , as they find it impossible to stop work due to financial concerns .<-->O
However , many people feel that this is bad for children , who then have to be looked after by an outside source during the day , such as a childminder or nursery school .<-->O
As early childhood is the most precious time of a child s development , it is important that the mother or indeed the father should be there for that child and devote as much time as possible .<-->O
By staying at home , mothers can ensure that their children have the best start in life , by giving them love and attention and turning away any future problems .<-->O
On the contrary , many people believe that mothers should have as much choice and freedom as anyone else in society , so that they can decide what is best for their children .<-->O
If they would rather work than look after their children , then why shouldn t they be given the choice to do so ?<-->O
Shouldn t this be considered equally valid ?<-->N
In many cases , women who are forced to give up work that they enjoy , fall into deep depression and find it hard to recover .<-->O
Subsequently , many childcare options are of very poor standard ; in some cases with only one adult looking after many children at once .<-->O
It can leave children bored , which in turn can slow their rate of development .<-->N
Those on low pay are often forced to rely on these options .<-->N
Although , many people have argued this case and as a result , it has been proven that many forms of childcare are actually beneficial to both the parent and the child .<-->O
For many centuries , it has been traditional for a member of the extended family , such as a grandparent , to help to look after the children , as they have had good experience before .<-->O
Similarly , childcare professionals are trained and have taken courses on which they are taught how to look after young children properly and in some cases even more knowledgeable , than the first time parent themselves .<-->O
Furthermore , playing with other children of a similar age is good for improving their social skills .<-->N
Mothers who stay at home are known to benefit the whole society .<-->N
Consequently , having more time , suggests that they are more likely to help out in the community or be a volunteer worker at a local organisation .<-->N
Above all , they will also be more involved in their child s education , for instance , going to PTA meetings , helping out on school trips , or even going to mother and toddler groups .<-->N
Mothers who stay at home are able to become fully involved in all these aspects of community life .<-->N
Of course on the other hand , encouraging women to work increases the workforce , which significantly increases the exports and productivity of the country .<-->N
Over time , this will also generate employment for even more people .<-->N
Because the whole society benefits from giving children the best start in life , don t you think that the government should do more to allow more women to stay at home to look after their kids ?<-->O
After all , it is the most important time of their lives .<-->N
Most women do have the legal right to maternity leave .<-->N
In the UK , this consists of 26 paid weeks and 26 un-paid weeks .<-->N
In some countries , this is offered to either parent up until the child is 18 months old .<-->N
Many people have argued that many women have actually no choice about whether to work or to stay at home ; either through money concerns or because they are single parents .<-->O
Women often feel that they have to work to provide enough money for their family .<-->N
Studies have shown that poverty has a lasting negative impact on children , regardless of having a mother at home .<-->O
Expecting mothers to stay at home also makes them very dependent on their partners .<-->N
Many religions and cultures view a woman s place , as being in the home .<-->N
Within this , they are clearly respected , for wanting to bring up their children , the best that they possibly can .<-->O
As motherhood is thought to be the most important role for women , those who do not have children will more than likely suffer from prejudice .<-->O
It will also deny them equal opportunities in most other areas of life .<-->O
Some people also think that by focusing all the child s attention on the mother , it often neglects the role of the father or other family members .<-->N
The father may not have as many opportunities in raising the child , therefore meaning the child may grow more attached to their mother .<-->N
To conclude , I can say that I agree with both points of view .<-->O
Personally , if I were to have children in the future , I would prefer to stay at home caring for my children , as I would like to spend as much time as possible with them and not miss out on the experience .<-->O
Also , if you and your partner decided to have kids in the first place , I think that you should take full responsibility of them , instead of just handing them over to someone else to look after .<-->O
I don t think this matter can be resolved , as I think that it should be the mother s own decision whether to look after her children or to earn her own living , as there are many different circumstances .<-->O
After all , isn t the mother s right to live how she wants to ?<-->O
Shouldn t she be able to decide what is best for her life ?<-->O
Ideally , should mothers stay at home to look after their children ?<-->N
In the age of apparent equality , women are increasingly encouraged to have it all , balancing career , children and marriage in order to be seen as successful .<-->O
Some feel this is bad for children who are then cared for by others .<-->O
Others feel that no harm comes to children if the alternative care is good and that children may in fact benefit if paid work makes the mother happier and her work improves the family s living standards .<-->O
Occasionally fathers will also decide to stay home as carers instead of mothers .<-->N
In many countries , mothers -LRB- and sometimes fathers -RRB- have a legal right to maternity -LRB- or paternity leave -RRB- .<-->N
The Czech Republic has the longest parental leave programme , lasting until the children are 2-3 years old and can be taken by either parent .<-->N
For UK women this comprises 26 weeks paid leave and 26 weeks unpaid leave .<-->N
Recently the British government has made changes so that this leave can be shared between partners as the parents see fit .<-->N
In Sweden , leave is offered to either parent until the child is 18 months old .<-->N
The USA does not have a national paid maternity leave program .<-->N
Other options exist , such as protecting the right to ask for part-time work or flexible hours .<-->O
However in many families , especially where the mother earns the majority of the family s income and may be the only earner , it is financially impossible for the mother to stop work without considerable state support , which in most cases doesn t exist .<-->O
Many studies point to the years before a child starts school as the most important in its educational and emotional development .<-->O
For this reason , should the mother be at home , at least until her children start school ?<-->O
Or can children develop equally well - or sometimes better - with support from others in addition to their mothers ?<-->O
What are your thoughts ?<-->N
Ideally , should the mom stay at home to look after her child ?<-->N
Felix Debate 01 : Mothers should stay at home and look after their children In the age of apparent equality women are increasingly encouraged to have it all , balancing career , children and marriage in order to be seen as successful .<-->O
Some feel this is bad for children who are then cared for by a child-minder , nursery , or member of the extended family .<-->O
Others feel that no harm comes to children if the alternative care is good and that children may in fact benefit if paid work makes the mother happier and her work improves the family s living standards .<-->O
Roy : For Felix : Against Roy Ahem ahem ahem , let me start by saying , that I have no idea why I was picked for this topic and I m probably going to lose .<-->N
Obviously any topic about women s rights is a losing one !<-->N
Blah blah blah , I want an abortion , blah blah I want to get paid time off to have a baby that I m going to abort !<-->O
This stinks .<-->N
Felix Eh , maybe we should change topics ?<-->N
Roy But I already read like two pages on this .<-->N
Let s just get this over with Felix Eh , okay then .<-->O
Maybe I should start !<-->N
Roy Go ahead .<-->F
Felix Alright !<-->N
The argument is that mothers should stay at home and look after their children .<-->O
But why should they ?<-->N
Is it fair to have mothers stay at home , while fathers are freely able to explore the things they want out of life ?<-->O
Sure , I d like it if my mom were always around to take care of me but I d never want to get in the way of the things she wanted to do .<-->O
Roy Okay , but what do women really want to do besides shop and look pretty ?<-->O
It s a win win !<-->N
You stay at home with the kid and take em out when you go to the store .<-->N
The guys doing all the work so you can basically do whatever you want !<-->O
I wish I was a woman !<-->N
Yup stay at home , and look at myself in the mirror all day .<-->N
Felix So , the idea is , eh women should stay at home cause it s fun ?<-->O
Roy Uhhhh .<-->N
Felix If I ask more questions , are you by any chance going to say something offensive ?<-->F
Roy Probably .<-->N
If you wan na call THAT offensive .<-->F
Felix -LRB- sigh -RRB- I guess I m done .<-->F
Roy Great !<-->F
For the record I didn t learn anything !!<-->N
Felix -LRB- I ve never understood why people hit their heads against the wall , but I think I m starting to get the idea . -RRB-<-->O
Do stay-at-home mothers upset you ?<-->N
You may be a motherist Dr Aric Sigman , at a conference convened by Mothers At Home Matter -LRB- if you want a clue , as to its agenda , I refer you to the name -RRB- , warned of the rise of `` motherism '' ; a prejudice against stay-at-home mothers .<-->O
Sigman is well known for his re-traditionalising intentions , to which end he has been accused of misrepresenting behavioural and neurological evidence , a claim he has denied .<-->O
So , he says `` motherism '' is dangerous because it puts women off being stay-at-home mothers , which is the developmental ideal .<-->N
I 'd reject the second part of the argument , but not the first there is a prejudice against stay-at-home mothers .<-->O
There is a presentation of women who look after their own children full time as air-headed , spoilt and dowdy .<-->N
However , there is also a prejudice against women who look after their children but are n't dowdy -LRB- yummy mummies -RRB- ; women who go back to work after having had children ; women who stay out of work but also employ nannies ; women who work part-time and look after their children the rest of the time .<-->O
I think the only way you could gain approval for your time-management , as a mother , would be to look after your children all the time as well as working full-time but for some socially useful enterprise -LRB- ideally voluntary work -RRB- , while never relying on a man for money , yet never claiming benefits either , but God forbid that you should have a private income .<-->O
Mothers in society act as whipping boys for almost all other social fissures ; oh , the irony of there being no female equivalent for the phrase `` whipping boy '' , when it is almost always a female .<-->O
Oh the side-spitting irony .<-->N
Here are four examples of `` motherisms '' at work : 1 -RRB- What they say : `` I do n't see why mothers need these enormous buggies '' If you were pushing anyone who could n't walk but was n't a baby , people would happily put themselves out a bit .<-->O
The act of pushing a baby , however , confers an aura of smugness about you -LRB- `` look at you , so in love , with your baby '' -RRB- that makes it unthinkable to just help you out .<-->O
There 's an element of sense in this ; mothers are in love with their babies , for the most part .<-->O
And they would see you step into a puddle just to avoid the smallest jolt to their airsprung sleeping chariot .<-->O
But it 's not the end of the sodding world , is it , mothers temporarily losing their social etiquette while they fall in love with their babies ?<-->O
What they say -LRB- at the school gates , whispered -RRB- : `` You never see the mother '' Even if the child is dropped off by the father , there is very little quarter given to the mother who is n't visible to the child 's social circle , and not much consideration of the possibility that maybe her work starts at 9am precisely so she can get home by 6pm .<-->O
I personally think this is a Freudian throwback , the resentment of children of the 70s and 80s , who were the first generation having to contend with bloody maternal no-shows at the harvest festival .<-->O
It 's the only rationale I can think of for why a person would think it was any of their business how a mother organised her time .<-->O
What they say -LRB- going in to a cafe , during the hours of standard economic activity -RRB- : ` Look at all these women who do n't work .<-->N
I wish I could afford not to work ' I personally think the greatest misconception around childcare , shared by a huge proportion of the adult population , the people who 've never done it , plus people who 've done it but ca n't remember it , is that it is easy .<-->O
It is by far the most demanding job conceived by society , wringing you out like a blood-drenched bedsheet , each day leaving you physically drained and mentally poleaxed , without even the energy to close your own mouth or hold your head upright , often making an involuntary gargling noise .<-->O
Some of it 's quite fun .<-->O
But anyway , that 's an aside .<-->N
There 's no economic sense to this question ; if the women drinking coffee were n't looking after their children , someone else would have to , which would in most cases cost as much as their wages .<-->O
So what people are really objecting to is not that mothers can afford not to work , but that they can still afford coffee .<-->O
What they say : ' I never have anything to say to these yummy mummies ' Dressed up as a deficiency of the speaker -LRB- I never have anything to say -RRB- it is actually a charge levelled at the mother , that she has no interests ; why ?<-->O
Because , being `` yummy '' , she is narcissistic and ca n't see beyond pilates and Brazilian hot waxing .<-->N
The true resentment is of her wealth that her life is n't one of drudgery and servitude , but spa treatments and interiors .<-->O
Well , that 's fine it 's possible to make a good case for objecting to wealth , since so much of it is unjustly come by .<-->O
But at least object to the people unjustly coming by it .<-->O
It seems a little tangential to make the wife the object of the opprobrium .<-->O
All she 's done is have a kid and fancy up her pubic area .<-->O
Staying at home : Pros and cons What the experts say Some experts in early childhood development believe there 's no substitute for the consistency and nurturing of parental care , especially if the alternative is poorly funded childcare .<-->O
Two groundbreaking studies , one conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the other by the Institute of Child Development of the University of Minnesota , found that kids who spent all day in daycare had higher levels of stress and more aggression than kids cared for at home .<-->O
Follow-up research in 2010 confirmed these results , showing the continued negative impact of low-quality daycare on young children , even after they reached adolescence .<-->N
But other studies contradict these findings , and most experts believe that the quality , not the type of childcare , is what 's most important .<-->O
A greatnanny , babysitter , daycare center worker , relative , or other caregiver can make sure your child gets the stimulation and affection she needs to grow and thrive .<-->O
What are the advantages of being a stay-at-home parent ?<-->N
As a stay-at-home parent you 'll know that your child is being cared for by someone who 's going to be around for a long time , not a caregiver who might take another job next month .<-->O
And you 'll be directly supervising your child 's care , making sure it 's in a relaxed , nurturing environment .<-->O
And you 'll be there to see all those `` firsts , '' which can be incredibly satisfying .<-->N
Says mom Molly Olsen , `` Staying home with Ezra allowed me to really focus on him and be in touch with his emotional and physical milestones .<-->O
I 'm glad it was me and not a teacher who saw him sit up or laugh for the first time . ''<-->O
Margie Johnson , who 's been a stay-at-home mom for 24 years with seven kids , says staying home has fulfilled her more than anything else could .<-->N
`` It 's the most rewarding ` career ' you could ever have , '' she says .<-->O
`` You 're irreplaceable to your child , and you 're making an ongoing personal investment that will outlive you . ''<-->N
-LRB- Johnson is on the board of directors of the Family and Home Network , a nonprofit organization dedicated to encouraging mothers or fathers to stay home with their children . -RRB-<-->O
For some families , it 's actually less expensive for one parent to stay home than it would be to pay for childcare .<-->O
-LRB- Read more about measuring the cost of staying home . -RRB-<-->N
And if you can afford it , you may find that staying home reduces your stress level .<-->N
Many parents decide to stay home after trying unsatisfactorily to balance work and family .<-->N
The long hours and the feeling of cutting too many corners leaves them feeling burned out .<-->O
Staying home will give you more time to spend with your children , maintain your home , and help keep your family life running smoothly .<-->N
What are the disadvantages ?<-->N
For some people , loneliness tops the list .<-->N
If you 're accustomed to the camaraderie and stimulation of being surrounded by other adults at work , the change of pace can lead to feelings of depression .<-->N
Stay-at-home dads may feel doubly isolated because there are so few of them .<-->O
`` There are n't any other stay-at-home dads just around the block , '' says Jay Massey , who cares for his son and used to run a website for at-home dads called Slowlane .<-->O
Moms and dads who were n't happy about leaving the workplace behind can feel even more alienated .<-->O
`` I had a hard time connecting with other stay-at-home moms , '' says Ann Nicholas , who 's now back in the work force part-time .<-->O
`` I felt we did n't have a lot in common . ''<-->N

5 Reasons Your Kid Should Not Have A Cell Phone I ll admit it .<-->N
I m a dinosaur among my friends because I won t get my kids a cell phone .<-->N
My daughters , aged 9 and 11 , remind me of that daily with pleas of I m the only one without a phone ; all my friends have one .<-->N
Why can t I ?<-->N
So , because I didn t want to sound like my mother who always countered with If everyone was jumping off a bridge , would you do it too ?<-->O
, I decided to look for a better answer .<-->O
I was shocked to discover that 21 % of children 8 years and younger use smart phones !<-->N
Wow younger than 8 !<-->N
And 78 % of children aged 12 to 17 already have a cell phone .<-->N
But before you add your kid to your cellular plan , consider why waiting could be a better option .<-->O
Privacy Concerns You may be surprised to find out that only 61 % of youth use privacy settings on their social media sites and 52 % don t turn off their location or GPS services .<-->F
This leaves their locations visible to strangers .<-->N
But the scariest revelation to me was that 14 % of children have posted their home addresses online .<-->N
And before you say , OH my child would NEVER do anything like that , because we ve had the talk with them ; realize this study also revealed that almost 70 % of the youth polled admitted to hiding their online activities .<-->N
Add this to the fact that less than half of the parents are aware of what their child is doing online .<-->O
Regrets So what exactly are the kids doing online with their smartphones ?<-->N
Since 1 in 4 teens are cell-mostly internet users , saying they mostly go online using their phone , parents need to realize this is their access to the online world .<-->O
The phones really aren t just for talking anymore .<-->O
They are use for texting , surfing , social media , pictures , and yes even sexting .<-->N
1 in 4 use their phones primarily as a computer for online access , the other 75 % use their tablets or other mobile device .<-->N
So even if you think they re not online because they don t have a phone - ask yourself - do they have a tablet , an iPod , an iPad , a kindle ?<-->N
These need to be monitored just as heavily as smart phones .<-->O
The Digital Deception study in 2013 revealed that nearly half of all teens say they ve posted something online that they later regretted .<-->N
This regret can cause more than embarrassment .<-->O
It can cost careers .<-->N
Because Onedevice Research discovered that 8 % of US people aged 16 to 34 have been turned down for a job because of their social media profile .<-->N
And let s not ignore the regret of Sexting .<-->N
It s taken more than one Weiner down -LRB- Anthony Weiner , the former US congressman to be exact -RRB- .<-->N
And a study performed by USC researchers discovered that 20 % of teenagers said they d received a sext , but only about 5 % admitted to having sent one .<-->N
The July issue of the journal Pediatrics found that among 1,300 middle school students , ranging from 10 to 15 years old and anonymously sampled , that they were more likely to report being sexually active if they also were sending more than 100 texts a day .<-->N
That drew a direct correlation that stated , Our results show that excessive , unlimited , or unmonitored texting seems to enable sexting .<-->O
And if that s not enough , over half of the kids aged 10 to 17 admitted to posting risky comments or photos online .<-->N
All the while , 25 % of them said they use their mobile device to hide this type of online behavior from their parents .<-->N
Ten Reasons Why a Kid Should Have a Cell Phone It s hard to remember what we did without cell phones connecting us to our friends , family and the world at large .<-->O
Many of us use them to chat and tweet our every given thought whenever we feel like it .<-->O
We call and text each other regularly , letting a friend know we re lost or running late .<-->O
We remind a spouse to pick something up on the way home from work , and we check in on long-distance relatives while we re stuck in traffic .<-->N
Our kids are also part of the mix when it comes to cell phones .<-->N
Grade-schoolers , tweens and teens all want a cell phone .<-->N
If you re on the fence about it , there are 10 solid reasons to justify getting your child a cell phone .<-->N
Practicality Both kids and parents are busy these days , and it makes sense for parents to be able to call their kids and let them know they re running late when picking them up for school or activities .<-->O
It also makes sense for children to be able to call their parents to tell them extra-curricular activities are running late or they will be late for dinner .<-->O
Safety Earthquakes , fires , bad weather , traffic accidents there are many things that can happen during the day after your children leave the house for school .<-->N
Cell phones are a lifeline between a parent and their children , and cell phones also can be used to call emergency responders .<-->N
Necessity If your child needs to get in touch with you because they re running late , or they decide to go to a movie at the mall , there are few pay phones left for them to use to call you .<-->O
Responsibility A cell phone gives your child a way to be more responsible and let you know if they re going to be late .<-->N
Cell phones are also important for teenagers , who could find themselves at a party without a sober ride home and need to call you to pick them up .<-->O
Trust Cell phones aren t cheap .<-->N
Giving your child a cell phone tells him that you trust him with something of value .<-->N
You are also telling your child that you are trusting him to use his allocated minutes wisely .<-->O
Divorce When parents are divorced , a cell phone is a good way for a child to keep in contact with both parents at all times , and it gives the parent who does not live in the same home as the child a good opportunity to stay involved .<-->O
Extended Family & Military Families Cell phones are a good incentive for kids to keep in contact with long-distance relatives , like grandparents or aunts and uncles .<-->N
Cell phones also enable kids to keep in touch with a parent who is overseas in the military , and who may have limited times when they can connect with a phone call .<-->O
Games Cell phones now come with many fun , inexpensive games that kids can play with to keep them busy while waiting in long lines or for a doctor or dentist appointment .<-->O
Reminders Cell phones come with alarms , note-taking applications and all kinds of apps that will help keep your child organized and remind them of their next test or homework assignment .<-->N
Social Communications Cell phones are deeply woven into our social fabric .<-->N
Teens use social media to text , tweet or post their feelings , detail their likes and dislikes , and basically help them feel connected to their peers and the world around them .<-->O
TOP 10 Reasons Kids Have Cell Phones Where we live most kids have cell phones by age 10 on average .<-->N
Here are the top 10 reasons why : 1 -RRB- By middle school or junior high just , about all kids carry a cell phone , or `` cell '' at all times , so it makes them feel grown-up , like you trust them with something of value .<-->O
2 -RRB- Many kids take medication and/or have allergies and could need sudden attention .<-->O
It is a safety issue really , so in an emergency they can always contact someone .<-->N
3 -RRB- Most kids have working parents that need to be contacted after school or from activities .<-->N
4 -RRB- The phones are generally not used during the day until high school , when kids mainly text message and make some calls between classes and after school as well , usually to coordinate plans or call for rides .<-->N
5 -RRB- There are no or very few `` pay phones '' left in our area , so cells are the only way to reach people from public places .<-->N
6 -RRB- Cells are great on weekends too for divorced families so kids can always reach the parent with whom they are not staying and the other parent can reach the child without having to go through the x-spouse .<-->O
7 -RRB- There are great free or inexpensive games for entertainment in the car or in waiting areas .<-->O
8 -RRB- They are just part of socialization here , as the home phone was when we were kids , except they have photos , videos , games and music as added value .<-->O
9 -RRB- As far as the safety of the cells , my kids text , play games , and use the photos and video , more than they even talk on the phones .<-->N
They do not talk long when they do talk , usually just calls to make plans and have brief conversations .<-->O
Unfortunately , cordless home phones also have similiar `` Brain Cancer '' warnings anyway .<-->N
I 'm not convinced any technology including wireless Internet is completely healthy or safe , but not terribly worried either because we would probably know by now if it were extremely risky .<-->O
Obviously , if studies show increasing harm , I would reconsider exposing my children or myself to those risks .<-->O
10 -RRB- Since our A T & T phones were free , and we share minutes that also rollover each month if not used , it is not much more of an additional expensive .<-->O
We can save almost as much because do n't need a home phone at all really .<-->O
Talking Point : Should children have mobile phones ?<-->F
They are the new mobile generation .<-->F
Increasing numbers of children , some as young as six , are now being given mobile phones .<-->N
In fact , a recent study by The Marketing Store found that 73 % of British 10-year-olds own a mobile , as do 24 % of eight-year-olds and 6 % of six-year-olds .<-->N
The reason behind this might be because mums and dads simply succumb to nagging , but more often than not , it s to ease parents safety fears when their kids are out and about .<-->O
While children having a mobile connection may help parents feel their kids are safer though , it s important to remember there s much more to modern mobiles than just the handset .<-->O
An additional survey by mobile phone insurance company , mobileinsurance.co.uk , showed that 58 % of parents admit they don t keep an eye on what their children -LRB- under 10 -RRB- are actually using their mobiles for , raising obvious concerns that children may be accessing unsuitable content on the internet , or being bullied via their mobiles .<-->O
When asked why they didn t check , 42 % of parents said they never got round to it , 27 % didn t want to intrude on their child s privacy , and 13 % said they trusted their youngster .<-->O
Jason Brockman , director of mobileinsurance.co.uk , warns parents they have to be more alert .<-->N
It s not a case of invading children s privacy , it should be seen as a way of keeping them safe , he stresses .<-->N
Unrestricted internet access , talking to strangers and bullying aren t the only problems with children s mobile phone use either .<-->N
Figures released by the Office for National Statistics earlier this year revealed that mobile phone theft victims are most likely to be youngsters aged 14 to 17 years , with their victimisation rate being twice as high as the average , at around 4 % .<-->O
To try to reduce the chances of children s mobiles being stolen , it s a good idea to get an old , cheap handset perhaps one passed down by a parent or an older sibling .<-->O
Sadly though , whatever the type of mobile a child owns , figures suggest using any one puts them at greater risk of being injured or killed in a road accident .<-->O
The road safety lobbying group RoadSafe and AXA car insurance recently found that 11 years old is both the highest accident risk age for child pedestrians and the average age a child receives their first mobile phone .<-->N
By the age of 12 , 25 % of kids admit they ve been distracted by personal technology when crossing a road .<-->N
Jeremy Todd , chief executive of parenting charity Family Lives , says : It s clear that mobile phones can be a potential distraction for children and indeed adults as they walk the streets , with texting and social media messages a particular concern .<-->O
Children may be unaware of the risks around them when out and about on busy streets , so it s vital that parents sit down with them to discuss the potential risks of using mobile phones when out in public .<-->O
Todd acknowledges that giving a child a mobile phone can be a difficult decision for parents , and urges them to ask themselves whether their child really needs a mobile phone , and whether they d actually be able to use it in an emergency .<-->O
If you re getting a phone , pick one you feel your child can manage .<-->N
There s no point in having an all singing , all dancing phone if they aren t going to be able to work it , he advises .<-->N
Again though , it can seem that the pros outweigh these cons , with some separated parents liking their children to have mobile phones because it s easier to keep in touch with them , and many parents also feeling more confident about giving their child more independence , for example walking home from school alone , if they have the safety net of a mobile .<-->O
So , if you have decided it is right for your child to have a mobile , what boundaries do you need to set ?<-->O
Firstly , rules should be made about the time spent talking on the phone , so you don t get astronomical phone bills .<-->O
Parents need to talk openly to children about extra costs that might be incurred if they use the internet for example .<-->O
Also speak openly and clearly about cyberbullying , and encourage your children to talk to an adult if they have any concerns about this .<-->O
Todd also suggests parents might want to ban the mobile phone in the bedroom at night , as research shows that children -LRB- and adults -RRB- don t sleep as soundly if the mobile is by the bed .<-->O
The mobile should also be banned at other times , he says , like meals , or when children are supposed to be doing their homework .<-->O
Parents of older children should also ensure they understand the potential dangers and consequences of sending explicit photos or sexual texts .<-->O
Basically though , if you have any doubts about your child using their mobile , monitor the situation and let them know that you ll be checking as and when you see fit , Todd stresses .<-->O
They need to prove to you that they can be responsible .<-->O
Parents can ask their children s mobile provider to block access to websites unsuitable for the under 18s .<-->N

YOUNG Joseph Brook tends not to stray far from his Newsome home .<-->N
But like most nine-year-old boys , some times that spirit of adventure takes over .<-->O
Hence the mobile phone in his pocket .<-->N
And the message from mum Emma and dad Mat : Tell us where you are going .<-->N
Joseph , a pupil at Newsome Junior School , has the phone with him when he s out playing with friends and brother Charlie and sister Ruby in the fields and gardens near his Berry View home .<-->N
Like many of his friends , he has had the Pay as You go mobile for a few months .<-->N
Mum Emma said : He s not allowed to take it to school nor when he goes to Cub Scouts , but at other times he does carry it with him .<-->N
It is mainly so that I or Mat can check on where he is .<-->N
He is sensible but if he tells me he s going to play in the field and then disappears into a friend s home , at least he can ring or text me to let me know .<-->O
Many times I have gone out to look for him and he s in a friend s house so the phone is vital .<-->O
But she has no plans to upgrade the mobile .<-->N
It s a Pay As You Go model which lets him make phone calls and send texts , and it has one game on it .<-->N
SHE S an expert on families and a mum herself .<-->N
And University of Huddersfield lecturer Dr Abigail Locke concedes there are many reasons why young children should be given mobile phones .<-->N
But her oldest daughter won t be getting her own mobile until she s 11 and moving up to high school .<-->N
Dr Locke admits : I may not be popular in our house but that s the way I feel .<-->N
My daughter is nine at the moment and continually pestering me to get her a phone , saying all her friends have one .<-->N
There are two issues here .<-->N
One is that I can see that some parents will give in to the constant demands , the nagging from their children , who claim they are the only ones without a phone .<-->O
They see their peers using a phone and want to be the same .<-->N
But more importantly there is the safety angle .<-->N
There has been some research work done recently called Paranoid Parenting which talks about the pressures on parents to be constantly checking where their sons or daughters area .<-->N
We are living in a high-risk society and it is a different world to what it was a generation ago .<-->N
Parents do give their children mobiles to ensure they can contact them at any time and it is of help when children are making their own way to school , as they do when they move on up to high school .<-->O
But mobiles do bring other risk factors with access to the internet and websites .<-->N
We have heard many harrowing examples of teenagers and older children being totally unable to cope with messages and texts aimed at them on social media and it would very worrying to think that primary school children could be exposed to those risks .<-->O
Mobile phones are good from a safety point of view but my own thinking is proceed with caution .<-->O
THESE days , there are a staggering six billion mobile phones in use .<-->N
Many of those are tiny lightweight devices that do everything bar make the tea .<-->N
And technology has come a long way since the very early days .<-->N
Telephone engineers began experimenting with calls from trains in 1924 in Germany , and from cars in 1946 .<-->N
But it was not until 1973 that Motorola engineers John Mitchell and Dr Martin Cooper made the first commercial cellphone .<-->F
It was labelled The Brick weighing in at a colossal 2.2 lb , or 1kg , which is the equivalent to a bag of sugar .<-->N
The first text message to a mobile phone wasn t sent until 1992 , when a British computer engineer successfully sent a message .<-->N
Now there are millions of text messages sent every day .<-->N
The mobile phone industry is big business and the three biggest players are Samsung , Nokia and Apple .<-->F
But there are also risks police across many parts of the world say that one in every three robberies involves a mobile phone .<-->F
Good Reasons Why a Child Should Have a Phone You might be considering getting a cell phone for your child , but perhaps you 're unsure whether she 's ready to handle the responsibility .<-->O
One-fifth of children already own a cell phone at the age of 8 , according to a 2011 survey conducted by Bridgewater State University for the Massachusetts Aggression Research Center .<-->N
Determining when your child is ready for a cell phone is contingent on her maturity level , family circumstances and whether she needs one , according to author Scott Steinberg , as cited on the Parenting website .<-->O
When the time is right , a cell phone can provide your child with safety and security , and give you peace of mind .<-->O
Emergencies If your child finds himself in a potentially dangerous situation , such as being approached by a stranger , being followed home from school or suddenly becoming ill , having a cell phone can be crucial in obtaining help .<-->O
Using his cell phone , your child will be able to quickly call you , the proper authorities or emergency responders , according to Family Education .<-->O
You can program specific phone numbers into his cell phone , such as his physician , local police precinct , fire department and 911 .<-->N
Instruct your child not to wait until something bad actually happens , but immediately call for help whenever he feels threatened , frightened or unwell .<-->O
Staying Connected Cell phones allow you to stay connected with your child at all times .<-->N
You can call to ask a question , change plans , remind him of an appointment , tell him you 'll be late picking him up from baseball practice , offer support during his first day of school or simply say that you love him .<-->O
Cell phones can also be a convenient communication tool in your home -- when your child is in his bedroom , a text message reminds him to do his homework or that it 's dinnertime .<-->N
Your child 's cell phone also helps to ease homesickness while he 's away at camp or spending the weekend at Grandma 's house .<-->N
Navigation Even a short walk to school , a neighborhood store or a friend 's house can be confusing to a child , and he might lose his way .<-->O
A cell phone with GPS navigation can provide him with easy-to-follow directions while he 's on route , according to Wired .<-->N
The GPS shows him exactly where he is at all times and guides him to the destination with an easy-to-follow interactive map .<-->N
You can program the GPS with his destination , and it will provide directions to the location and also the route back home .<-->N
You might say , `` I know you 've walked to Joey 's house before , but I still want you to follow the map on your phone . ''<-->O
Tracking Providing your child with a cell phone allows you to always know where he is .<-->N
Most cell phone carriers offer family locator services that allow you to constantly monitor your child 's location through interactive satellite maps on your own cell phone or computer , according to Wired .<-->N
The family locator service will also send you a text message alert when your child reaches his destination and when he leaves it .<-->N
And it works both ways -- your child will be able to track your location , such as when you 're late picking him up at school and he can see on the map that you 're on your way .<-->O
Responsible Cell Phone Use Before buying your child a cell phone , discuss cell phone responsibility and lay the ground rules , recommends pediatrician Gwen O Keeffe , as cited on the Time website .<-->N
Inform him that he 'll be expected to follow the rules for cell phone use at his school , including turning it off during classes and study periods .<-->N
List the hours he wo n't be allowed to use the cell phone at home , such as while doing homework and at bedtime .<-->N
If he receives any sexually explicit or inappropriate photos , messages or phone calls , he should immediately report them to you and a school official .<-->O
Warn your child to never read or send text messages while walking or crossing the street .<-->N
Stress that the rules for cell phone use will be strictly enforced and if he violates any of them , his cell phone privileges will be removed .<-->O

Although mobile phones have become an integral part of adult society today , no parent should be obligated to purchase a mobile for their child .<-->N
Parents should take time to review the pros and cons of their children having a cell phone of their own and make wise decisions according to their personal situation .<-->N
The following provides some guidelines you may want to consider when debating the cell phone issue with your child .<-->O
What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone ?<-->N
A Necessity , Not a Right Depending on your children s personal situation , a cell phone may be a necessity for additional security and protection .<-->N
This does not mean , however , that acquiring a cell phone is a child s right .<-->O
Before purchasing a phone for your child , it would be good to discuss this aspect of cell phone ownership so that he has the right perspective concerning this product .<-->O
You don t want your child thinking that just because his best friend received a new iPhone for his 12th birthday , he has a right to receive the same .<-->O
This kind of mentality indicates a lack of maturity on his part .<-->O
Children and mobile phones don t always go together well .<-->N
Before deciding on the right age for a mobile , parents should take into consideration the mental and emotional maturity of their child .<-->O
As your children grow older , it is only natural for them to begin comparing various aspects of their life with their peers .<-->N
This often includes ownership of contemporary gadgets such as cell phones , notebooks , iPods , etc. .<-->N
Cell phone ownership , however , should be more than just a step towards keeping up with your child s circle of friends .<-->O
When used correctly , a cell phone can be a valuable tool for keeping in touch with your kids and enhancing their security .<-->O
When used improperly , these same devices can cause all kinds of problems and be a huge waste of money .<-->O

The Age Factor : How to Decide As a parent of an active older child , it is not uncommon to be concerned for his or her safety .<-->O
When your children are small , i.e. preschool and kindergarten age , they are almost always in the company of a responsible adult , whether it is you or your spouse , another family member , school teacher , nanny , etc. .<-->N
As they grow into their middle years , 7 to 10 years old , they start to become more independent , walking or riding a bus to and from school on their own .<-->N
This is a time where many parents begin to worry about the safety of their kids , especially if they have no way to keep in touch during the time they are away .<-->O
The preteen years -LRB- 11-12 -RRB- begin to add another dimension to a child s life .<-->N
Most preteens are involved in extracurricular activities that keep them away from home beyond school hours .<-->N
They may join a sports team or club , take dancing or music lessons or simply spend more time with their friends .<-->N
At this age , most parents recognize the importance of their children having a cell phone in order to get in touch with them if they have need .<-->O
By the time a child reaches adolescence , cell phone usage will be second nature to them .<-->N
Approximately 85 % of teenagers today age 14 to 17 have a mobile phone of their own .<-->N
Some use the device maturely while others don t. Teens that were taught to use a cell phone responsibly when they were younger may have fewer problems handling the device when they are older as compared to children who were given free rein with a mobile to do as they please .<-->O
There are many factors to consider when thinking about What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone .<-->O
The following are some questions you may want to ponder before you make any final decision .<-->O
Does your child really need a phone for security or does he want one merely for social reasons ?<-->O
Can your child handle the responsibility of owning and caring for a mobile ?<-->F
Is your child mature enough to use a mobile wisely ?<-->O
Is your child willing to have restrictions placed on his mobile usage ?<-->N
Can your child be trusted with a mobile device or will you need to be constantly monitoring his cell phone activities ?<-->O
Will a mobile phone interfere with your child s schooling , sleep and family responsibilities ?<-->F
Will a mobile be more of a help to your child or a hindrance ?<-->N
More on discovering What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone The answers to these questions will vary from child to child .<-->N
However , parents can use these questions as guidelines for deciding on What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone and whether their children are ready to own a mobile phone of their own .<-->N
What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone ?<-->F
What Kind of Phone Does Your Child Need ?<-->N
With today s modern technology , cell phones have become much more than a device for mere communication .<-->O
Contemporary mobiles can be used for making phone calls , checking emails , downloading information from the Internet , listening to music or audio files , playing games , watching movies , taking pictures , as location finding devices and more .<-->N
Of course , not all phones come fully loaded with all of these applications and not all children need a phone that is capable of all these functions .<-->O
Younger children do not really need a phone with so many extras .<-->O
For 8-10 year olds , a basic yet quality device will do .<-->N
If you feel your child is capable of handling a cell phone , you can start him off on a simple design that serves the purpose of keeping in touch when he has need .<-->O
In this way , you can test your child s maturity by how he handles , uses and cares for this investment .<-->N
As your child grows older into the preteen and younger teen age , you can always upgrade the phone according to his maturity level and individual need .<-->O
Learn how to talk to your children about online bullying .<-->N
As your teen grows older , he may desire a smart phone with all the latest technology and perks .<-->O
As a parent , you will need to discern whether a phone of this nature will be a benefit or detriment to his welfare .<-->O
Advanced cell phone technology may be all the rage for teens today , but it s not always the best neither is the high cost .<-->O
Many parents are open to buying their teen a quality device , but if he insists on the latest technology , they often suggest he pay for it on his own .<-->N
This may help him think twice about what he really needs .<-->O
At least it will make him value and care for his investment more .<-->O
What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone ?<-->N
Benefits and Detriments There are definitely many benefits to your child having a cell phone , if he is mature enough to handle one .<-->O
First , you will be able to keep in touch with your child and he with you at all times , wherever he may be .<-->O
This can alleviate many fears you might have about his personal safety .<-->O
Your children can communicate with you throughout the day , letting you know where they are , how they are , what they are doing , if they need help , etc. .<-->O
In the event of emergencies , your child can communicate with you immediately or you with him , to get the assistance he needs .<-->N
Security is perhaps one of the main reasons parents purchase a cell phone for their children .<-->N
At the same time , parents can not be blind to the detriments of cell phone ownership when making their decision .<-->N
A child who lacks maturity may use a cell phone irresponsibly , texting friends during classes at school or late at night when he should be sleeping .<-->O
If the phone has Internet connections , he may get on inappropriate sites or waste time surfing the Net .<-->N
A cell phone could be a major distraction from home or school obligations .<-->O
For teens that drive , a cell phone may present a physical risk if used improperly .<-->O
A teen that is calling or texting friends while he is driving can easily cause an accident .<-->N
By being careless in who they give their number to , teens can be subject to prank calls in the middle of the night or threatening phone calls from potentially dangerous people .<-->O
Yet another risk of cell phone usage is cyber bullying via texting or social media functions on the device .<-->N
These are all factors that need to be taken into consideration when deciding the right age for your children to own a mobile .<-->O
What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone and When is Your Child Ready ?<-->N
Although age is one consideration , it is not always the most important factor to consider when it comes to owning a mobile phone .<-->O
Maturity and a responsible nature are much more important qualities to look for in a child for mobile phone ownership and usage .<-->O
Parents need to make sure their children will use this device safely and sensibly on their own before making an investment .<-->O
It is easier to trust a child with a cell phone when you know he is generally obedient to your instructions and takes good care of his belongings .<-->O
His obedience will make it easier to accept whatever restrictions you may place on cell phone usage .<-->O
His diligence in taking care of his property will ensure the phone is not easily lost or broken .<-->O
One of the biggest tests for children with cell phones is allowing their parents to monitor its usage .<-->N
If your older child or preteen is using his or her mobile properly , there should be no objections to your occasionally checking their text messages , tweets or Internet usage .<-->O
Once your child reaches adolescence , he or she may resent cell phone monitoring as an invasion of privacy .<-->N
These are matters you will need to work out with your teen in advance , especially if you are footing the bill for his mobile .<-->O
You may need to come to a happy medium of trust and monitoring so that some manner of supervision is maintained .<-->O
What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone and Ground Rules for Mobile Phone Usage Once you decide your child is ready for a mobile phone , set some ground rules from the beginning so that your child knows what to expect from having this privilege .<-->O
Your rules may include : Setting limits on calls and texts by purchasing a plan .<-->N
Designating times when the phone must be turned off , i.e. during school , meals , time for homework or after a certain hour at night .<-->N
No sleeping with phones .<-->N
No gossiping or sending disrespectful messages or calls .<-->N
Never answer calls or texts from people they don t know .<-->N
For teens who drive , no phone usage when they are driving .<-->N
Teens can also pay for their own phone usage .<-->N
By following these guidelines , you and your children stand a better chance of having a more pleasant and beneficial mobile phone experience .<-->O
There s no reason why the concept of children and mobile phones can not work , if it is handled responsibly from the very start .<-->O
Mobile phones can make communicating with your kids simpler and more convenient and can keep you well informed concerning their whereabouts and safety .<-->O
Cell phones can also help your older kids , preteens and teens hone their communication and social skills as they keep in touch with other family members , friends and peers .<-->O
and because of that , you need to find the answer to What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone for your children .<-->N
Owning a cell phone is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly .<-->N
You know your kids are at the right age for a mobile phone when they are ready to cooperate with you in its usage .<-->O
They can then benefit from all that cell phones have to offer without compromising on the values and standards you share .<-->N
The Pros and Cons of Letting Your Kid Have Their Own Cell Phone Should kids have their own cell phones ?<-->F
This question has been plaguing parents for about a decade now , and it s not going to be answered anytime soon .<-->F
Many of us roll our eyes at 8-year-olds parading around with their very own iPhone 5s decked out in Justin Bieber stickers .<-->F
As for their parents ?<-->N
They scoff at other parents who refrain from giving their children their own cell phones until their 15thbirthdays .<-->N
Those poor kids , the parents must think .<-->O
They must be outcasts at school !<-->N
There are two types of parents : those who give their young children their own cell phones , and those who don t. Each side has perfectly good reasons for its position .<-->O
If you re on the fence about giving your child their own cell phone , check out the following pros and cons of letting your kid have their own cell phone .<-->N
PROS Here are some reasons why you should give your child a cell phone .<-->N
Your child has a way to contact you quickly if something ever happens .<-->N
The main reason a lot of parents shell out money for a cell phone for their children is to keep them safe .<-->N
They can easily contact their parents if something happens .<-->N
In this scary world where children can t really trust grown-ups , it s sometimes important for a child to have his very own phone where anyone is a phone call away .<-->O
A cell phone keeps you in constant contact with your child .<-->N
This may seem too helicopter parentish , but it s actually good for you to constantly keep tabs on your kid .<-->O
You can use GPS technology -LRB- and an app like FamilyMap -RRB- to have a better sense of your child s whereabouts .<-->O
The younger your child is , the more useful this feature comes in .<-->N
Your child won t be bullied/considered an outcast at school for not owning a phone .<-->N
It s sad that children nowadays get bullied for not keeping up with the Jonses , but it s true .<-->O
Statistics show that almost 90 % of teenagers own a cell phone .<-->N
It s easy to imagine a teen not calling a friend because they re afraid that the friend s dad will answer the phone .<-->O
Not having a cell phone can make a child an outcast at school .<-->N
Heck , if your child does have a cell phone , but not a nifty phone case , he might get some flack for it .<-->O
Whether you like it or not , children can be mean and judgmental .<-->O
CONS Those pros are great , aren t they ?<-->N
Well , they might not be so great after you read the cons .<-->O
Your child may develop entitlement issues .<-->N
If you buy your 8-year-old a brand new iPhone , she will feel entitled to a brand new car when she turns 16 , a swanky apartment when she enters college , and so on .<-->O
There s a way to prevent your child from developing entitlement issues , and it s to buy her a cheap , used , and/or basic cellphone and save the fancy ones for when she gets old enough to understand the value of a dollar or just don t give her a cell phone until she s older .<-->O
Your choice .<-->N
Owning a cell phone makes your child more prone to bullying .<-->N
As if being online wasn t bad enough , now you have to worry about cell phones !<-->O
A cell phone gives your child another way to communicate with other kids .<-->N
Bullying can occur via text messaging -LRB- or prank calls -RRB- .<-->N
If your child s not being bullied , don t sigh just yet .<-->N
He could be the bully .<-->N
Your child may not be responsible enough for a cell phone .<-->N
I once heard a story about a 15-year-old boy who received nude pictures of his 15-year-old girlfriend via text message .<-->N
He shared the pictures with all of his friends , and his girlfriend eventually found out .<-->F
She blew the whistle and he was accused of distributing child pornography .<-->N
The court deemed his parents responsible and they were slapped with a huge fine .<-->O
The point of this story is , that you could get in a lot of trouble -LRB- or lose a lot of money -RRB- because of something your child did on his cell phone .<-->O
He could break the phone , call an expensive hotline , or do something serious that would get you in trouble with the law .<-->O
So , what to do ?<-->N
My personal opinion is to both give and take .<-->N
Stick with the pros , keep in mind the cons but I recommend not to over-do either side .<-->N
They want a mobile ?<-->N
They can have one for the pure reason of contact .<-->N
That should be taught as well .<-->N
They do not own a cell phone to have a status symbol and to show it around to other children .<-->N
It should be used for what it s intended for : necessary communication .<-->N
If they have their facts right they are more likely to survive school without being bullies or bullied .<-->O
Be creative !<-->N
If your child still comes home saying she has been told off by her friends for not having a fancy phone , make it fancy .<-->O
There are lovely phone cases and charms even grown-ups would envy .<-->O
Those can add style to an older phone but you can still stick to your principles .<-->N
They will get to an age , where you can set goals for them to reach to get a newer model , but try to keep small steps .<-->N
If you personally don t own the latest mobile , should your child do ?<-->N
10 Reasons a Kid Should Have a Cell Phone Just about every child , from middle school to teenager , wants to have his own cell phone .<-->N
This is a dilemma for parents because of the many downsides to letting a children have his own phone , such as higher cell phone bills and excessive time spent on the new gadget .<-->O
But there are many upsides to letting your child have a cell phone , which parents should consider before making the decision .<-->N
Security You are able to call or text your children at all times so you know where they are and what they are doing .<-->O
Relief You will also find yourself relieved of worry waiting up for your child at night when he or she has gone out with friends .<-->O
If your child is running late , she only has to give you a quick phone call to let you know she ll be arriving soon .<-->N
Emergencies If something were to happen , such as your child getting into a car accident or being stuck at a party , he will be able to reach you and let you know what is happening .<-->O
Something Happens to Your Child Also , if something happens to your child that makes him incapable of calling you himself , someone else can use his phone to call your number stored under the contacts .<-->N
Displaying Trust Giving your children a cell phone lets them know that you trust them to talk with their friends .<-->O
Bestowing Responsibility It can also be a method of teaching your children responsibility as they learn to control their minutes and the number of texts they send .<-->N
Reward A cell phone can also be used as a reward , showing your children that you are proud of them .<-->O
Conversely , it can be used as a form of discipline by taking the cell phone away when your child has misbehaved .<-->N
GPS Tracker Some cell phones have a GPS tracker built into the device .<-->F
This allows a parent to keep track online of their child s location .<-->N
An older child may be offended by this invasion of privacy , but it is perfect for young children .<-->N
Cost Many parents may not want to give their child a cell phone because they fear the size of their phone bill each month .<-->O
However , if you don t allow your child to have a web-enabled phone , keep them from downloading ring tones and limit their minutes , it doesn t cost too much to add your child onto an existing plan .<-->O
Control Many child phones also give the parent a great deal of control , with just a few buttons for Mom , Dad or other emergency contacts .<-->O
Teaching creationism in US schools A new Tennessee law will permit teachers to discuss creationism alongside theories of evolution , writes Casey Selwyn .<-->N
The case On April 11 2012 , Tennessee passed a law that protects teachers who choose to explore the merits of creationism alongside theories of evolution in public school science classes .<-->N
Governor Bill Haslam claimed that the legislation would not change scientific standards in schools and refused to sign the bill .<-->N
However , he refused to veto it either , so the bill became law .<-->N
Tennessee thus became the second US state to enact such legislation , following the academic freedom law of Louisiana in 2008 .<-->O
It purports to support teachers wanting to help students understand , analyse , critique and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories .<-->O
Its scope is not limited to evolution , as global warming and human cloning are also open to critique .<-->N
These three theories are widely accepted in terms of scientific merit .<-->N
Critics named the bill the Monkey Bill after Tennessee s 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial , in which John Scopes was convicted under state law for teaching evolution and later exonerated on appeal .<-->N
The law has attracted criticism , and some fear that it will inspire other states to pass similar bills in addition to acting as a backwards move in the fight to improve science and maths education in the US ; others claim it violates the principle of the separation of church and state .<-->O
Its supporters believe that it encourages healthy scepticism among students and that critical thinking and analysis fosters good science .<-->O
Author opinion While the principles of academic freedom and critical thinking are of vital importance in fostering good science and education policy , I do not believe this Tennessee bill encourages these principles .<-->O
Firstly , Tennessee undermined its own free speech credibility in education policy when that state s House Education Committee passed a Don t Say Gay bill on 18 April 2012 , which prevented teachers from discussing homosexuality .<-->N
Secondly , despite a provision in this law that claims that it does not promote any religious or non-religious doctrine , it clearly provides space for a religious creationist agenda .<-->O
While scientific principles uphold free speech to the highest standard in the practice of rigorous theory testing and the questioning of unproven facts , providing space in curriculum for children that promotes discredited theories while not truly subjecting them to rigorous scientific analysis provides them with a distorted view of facts versus fiction .<-->O
So , while critical analysis does foster good science and is necessary to uphold principles of free speech , it seems that an alternative , an unchallengeable defence of creationism seems to be a cover for the promotion of ideology over science , even while it is being presented as an example of free speech that should be protected .<-->O
If parents want to teach their kids about creationism , or the church does , that is absolutely acceptable , but to promote it as science in a secular public school setting is inappropriate .<-->O
Otherwise it seems to violate first amendment principles of freedom of religion , as demonstrated by the 1987 supreme court ruling that requiring creation science to be taught alongside evolution is schools is unconstitutional .<-->O
Should teachers have free speech in schools ?<-->N
Ehh I m not sure .<-->N
I m on the fence about this one .<-->N
I think it depends on what the class is . .<-->N
And what exactly the teacher is saying .<-->N
I think it is fine if the conversation or discussions is in some type of relation to the class .<-->N
Freedom of speech does not apply in the classroom ; students are not allowed to stand up and discuss whatever issues they want and neither should the teacher .<-->O
Both have to stick to a syllabus that ensures that the children are taught the basics of each subject .<-->N
-LRB- idebate.org http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/freespeechdebate/house-believes-tennessee-correct-protect-teachers-who-wish-explore -RRB- -LRB- for -RRB- I don t completely disagree that teachers shouldn t have free speech I think it should only be to a certain extent .<-->O
A class like yours Noblitt is completely okay because for the most part we stay on topic or we talk about current events .<-->O
Creationism should remain in religion classes and evolution should remain in science classes .<-->N
-LRB- idebate.org http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/freespeechdebate/house-believes-tennessee-correct-protect-teachers-who-wish-explore -RRB- -LRB- against -RRB- Anything that has anything to do with personal beliefs or sensitive subjects such as religion or something of that nature should stay in classes that are related to that certain subject .<-->O
Teachers should not be able to have free speech in schools if they are trying to force their beliefs on students or making them feel pressured into talking about something they don t feel comfortable talking to a teacher about .<-->O
Overall I don t really have a side I m 100 % sided with .<-->N
I agree with both arguments .<-->N
EXTRA CREDIT .<-->N
Constitutional protection if they are speaking about issues of a public nature , rather than those things about which they have a personal stake .<-->O
-LRB- http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/Main-Menu/Public-education/The-law-and-its-influence-on-public-school-districts-An-overview/Free-speech-and-public-schools.html -RRB- I agree with what most of this website says about teachers freely doing things .<-->N
They should be able to have free speech but only to a certain extent , they shouldn t be able to speak of things to a student that doesn t want to about personal beliefs and personal life decisions .<-->O
Judge said the school district was within its rights to terminate Mayer because of various complaints it received from parents about her teaching performance .<-->N
-LRB- http://www.progressive.org/news/2006/03/3210/judge-rules-teachers-have-no-free-speech-rights-class#.dpuf -RRB- I thought this article was kind of interesting because it talked about a teachers actual experiences about her free speech with her students .<-->O
Obviously the students and parents were offended by what she talked about and clearly didn t like it so since it causes so many issues with parents and students teachers should have to watch what they say when teaching in school .<-->O
Yes , teachers should have freedom of speech .<-->N
Teachers are looked at as role models or mentors .<-->N
If they put creationism into their lesson then I think it would be awesome .<-->O
But that s from a person that believes in creationism .<-->N
For people who don t believe in it then it will be controversial .<-->O
It would make more sense , then , to keep separate studies separate .<-->N
-LRB- http://ncse.com/cej/2/1/why-creationism-should-not-be-taught-as-science -RRB- -LSB- outside source -RSB- Some people agree with my point of view , I am not saying discussing this in schools is the best idea in the world , but it is certainly not the worst and it could be beneficial -LRB- http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/freespeechdebate/house-believes-tennessee-correct-protect-teachers-who-wish-explore -RRB- I think it should be taught and information given but teachers shouldn t push their own beliefs on to students .<-->O
If the student wants to know more then they could talk about it but they shouldn t criticize skeptics .<-->O

Tennessee passes law allowing creationism in the classroom Well , that s it then .<-->N
Tennessee s governor , William Haslam , allowed a clearly antiscience bill to pass into law .<-->N
It is now legal to essentially teach creationism in Tennessee public school classrooms .<-->N
You can read about the background of all this in an earlier post .<-->N
The TN House and Senate both passed this terrible , terrible bill , and Governor Haslam allowed it to beome law , saying , I do not believe that this legislation changes the scientific standards that are taught in our schools or the curriculum that is used by our teachers .<-->O
However , I also don t believe that it accomplishes anything that isn t already acceptable in our schools .<-->N
This is , to not to put too fine a point on it , a crock .<-->O
The legislation is designed specifically to allow creationism to be taught in classes , something the courts have clearly stated is against the law , and which just as clearly is unacceptable in our schools .<-->O
Governor Haslam , I ll note , didn t actually sign the bill into law .<-->N
In Tennessee , a bill passes by default if the governor takes too long to sign it .<-->N
By not vetoing it directly , he allowed it to pass .<-->N
That action , combined with his wishy-washy statement , makes it clear he is doing this for purely political motives .<-->N
This way , it s a law and the creationists are happy , and if people accuse him of weakening the Constitution and allowing a specific religion to be taught in public schools which he s doing then he can say he didn t actually sign the bill .<-->O
Nice , huh ?<-->N
So instead of doing the right thing , he has allowed students in classrooms across Tennessee to undergo religious indoctrination , despite a prior and clear Supreme Court ruling making it illegal .<-->O
And for this those of you who will want to split hairs and say this law only makes it legal to teach scientific weaknesses , and doesn t make it legal to teach creationism , I call baloney .<-->O
There is zero doubt zero that this will be used to teach creationism in the classroom under the guise of demonstrating -LRB- what they claim , wrongly , as -RRB- weaknesses in evolutionary science .<-->O
-LSB- Update : Steve Novella at the NeuroLogica blog has more details on this . -RSB-<-->N
So , unless and until someone fights this law and takes it to court to preserve the scientific integrity of the Tenessee public school classroom ------------------------ 4 .<-->O
Bill would protect teachers who teach creationism A Billings legislator has reintroduced a bill that would encourage high school teachers to present evolutionary biology as disputed theory rather than sound science and protect those who teach viewpoints like creationism in the classroom .<-->O
House Bill 321 is drafted by Republican Clayton Fiscus , who put forward a nearly identical bill in 2013 to emphasize critical thinking with regard to controversial scientific theories on the origin of life .<-->O
The supposed controversy doesn t exist among scientists , say advocates and educators .<-->N
It s all bunk , said Glenn Branch , deputy director for the National Center for Science Education based in Oakland , Calif. -LSB- Fiscus -RSB- thinks that these whole fields are scientifically controversial , and that s not true .<-->O
There is nothing controversial about the biology of evolution , he said .<-->N
There are controversies within biological evolution .<-->N
Fiscus bill does not mention alternative theories by name , but states that teachers must be permitted to help students review the strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories .<-->O
Branch said the anti-evolution law would mean teachers who elevate fringe ideas couldn t be held accountable by principals and superintendents .<-->O
It s inviting the teachers to go rogue , he said .<-->N
Fiscus , who represents HD 43 in the Billings Heights , did not respond to requests for comment .<-->N
But in the taped 2013 committee hearing , Fiscus said his bill would protect academic freedom , not attack science .<-->O
What we want to emphasize is critical thinking , he said .<-->O
It s no different than being on the farm .<-->N
When you re raising animals , you got ta think , you got ta do .<-->N
There s no boogeyman in this bill , he said .<-->N
Fiscus appeared to express personal skepticism toward accepted science during the hearing , however .<-->N
During his concluding remarks , he said evolutionary history involves a monumental leap and said the U.S. suffers from global warming creep .<-->N
And that s going to be in the schools , he added .<-->N
Fiscus also sought to illustrate the progression of human knowledge , saying that we re getting smarter faster than we ever did before .<-->O
Seven hundred years ago , there was critical thinking , he said .<-->O
Everyone was looking around , and the world was flat at that time .<-->N
Then about three or four hundred years later , Columbus proved it was round .<-->N
The idea that the explorer Christopher Columbus , who reached the Americas in 1492 , disproved flat Earth theories is a well-documented myth .<-->N
Branch said the way HB321 is drafted would allow teachers to espouse virtually any belief as scientifically valid , from herbal medicine to geocentric theories of the universe .<-->O
There s nothing ruling that out of this bill , he said .<-->N
A 2004 U.S. District Court case involving schools in Dover , Penn. , ruled that a policy requiring intelligent design be taught as an alternative to evolution violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .<-->N
One in eight high school biology teachers said in a 2007 survey that they include creationism as a valid scientific alternative to Darwinian evolution .<-->N
Craig Beals , a Billings science teacher and the 2015 Montana Teacher of the Year , isn t one of them .<-->N
The topics have long been debated not because scientists disagree but because the topics don t always agree with people s beliefs , he wrote in an email .<-->O
Beals said he doesn t shy away from evolution , climate change or the Big Bang in his classes .<-->N
Nor does he discourage students from expressing their opinions .<-->O
The discussions and debates allow students to showcase their opinions and allow students to hear alternate ideas from classmates .<-->O
And , because I teach chemistry and biology , we always conclude with the latest accepted scientific findings in order to separate opinion from science , Beals wrote .<-->N

5 Crucial Reasons to Teach Creationism in Public Schools Should creationism be taught alongside evolution ?<-->N
Is it fair to give students only one theory to believe ?<-->N
Is it legal to do so in the public schools ?<-->N
There are No Criticisms of Evolution There are no criticisms of the theory of evolution in any of the textbooks or course materials , despite the fact that evolution can not be stated as a scientific law and remains , for well over a century , a theory .<-->O
For one thing , evolution can not be validated to be factual because it can not be proven through scientific testing .<-->N
How can evolution ever be established to be conclusive by empirical scientific methods ?<-->N
Can evolution be observed in a laboratory ?<-->N
Is evolution repeatable ?<-->N
Is it predictable as to what will mankind look like in a million years from now ?<-->O
How can it be falsified ?<-->N
The classic historical structure of having scientific beliefs pass from theory to law is by having something be observed , repeated , to make predictions based upon those observations and have a repeated outcome and then falsify that the results .<-->O
Evolution is a historically based theory based upon assumptions from what took place millions of years ago .<-->N
What are missing are the gaps of transitional fossils that establish one specie evolving into another , new specie .<-->F
When there is yet another claim that a missing link has been found , the question arises , where is the chain in the first place ?<-->N
How can we claim to have found a missing link while there isn t even a chain ?<-->N
Maybe you ve seen the images or pictures of man evolving from apes in textbooks .<-->N
What are missing are transitional fossils between the ape and man so educators have to depend upon images and drawings to try and establish a connection .<-->O
It s because there are no fossils that they can take pictures of to display as proof .<-->N
Scientists have at their disposal , hundreds of millions of fossils and fossil samples , yet not one set of transitional fossils revealing specie evolving into another has ever been found .<-->N
Despite untold millions of categorized fossils their remains no set that establish a new life form evolving from another .<-->N
This fact was not lost by Darwin who said that he was troubled by the lack of fossil evidence showing that new species arose from previous ones .<-->O
Critical Thinking Skills It seems that public schools value critical thinking skills yet they are cramming an unproven theory down the student s throats and so it appears that they won t even consider other possibilities .<-->O
These educators are like dictators who essentially spout It s my way or the highway .<-->N
Since educational leadership want students to think outside the box in the other disciplines , why aren t they allowed to do so regarding the theory of evolution .<-->O
They say that they want the students to use their minds to solve problems , analyze issues , to critique thesis s , but how can a student do this if they are taught that the theory of evolution has no alternatives .<-->N
There are no other options , no other possibilities .<-->N
They are taught that there are no exceptions to the theory of evolution .<-->N
Even the educational textbooks are silent on the problematic areas of evolution .<-->N
For example , evolution does not address the question of where did the universe come from .<-->N
How did the universe come into existence ?<-->N
How did life arise since we know for a fact that life can not arise spontaneously ?<-->O
The theory of evolution is like coming into a movie that is half way through to the end .<-->N
What happened before life got here ?<-->N
How was non-living , inorganic matter able to come to life ?<-->N
The theory of evolution only deals with the fact that life had already existed and that life forms evolve into new species .<-->N
It seems to me that they are leaving out some crucial components .<-->N
It doesn t address the cause of these effects , how a universe from a singular point began or what forces were involved and necessary to have that first spark of life occur .<-->N
What about the Cambrian Explosion , a layer where almost every single life form is found in fossil form with few ancestral fossils before it or no new life fossil life forms above it ?<-->N
This sounds more like a philosophy than it does a science .<-->N
Children should be at least exposed to or taught other views and be allowed to make their own decisions based upon the information or the lack of information that they have .<-->O
Give Parents What They Want A 1991 Gallop Poll -LRB- Nov 28th , 1991 -RRB- , which was the last time a comprehensive polling results on a national scale was undertaken , indicated that 47 % of Americans believe in creation over evolution and 40 % believe that God used evolution as a process of creating life .<-->O
A few had no opinion and so that left only 9 % of Americans who believe that God was not involved and that only naturalistic means were the cause of the origin of life .<-->O
Since almost 9 out of every 10 Americans believe that God was involved in creation and just under half of those believed that the origin of life was not naturalistically caused , why do almost 100 % of college professors and staff teach that evolution is the only option possible ?<-->O
These professors and the colleges seem to be in the minority , yet they do not tolerate differences of opinion or belief , even though the theory of evolution has never been comprehensively established as a fact .<-->O
Why not let people choose what they want their children to learn ?<-->N
Don t these professors and colleges work for the students who pay their salaries or the parents who educate their children ?<-->N
Why is there no tolerance for those who differ in opinions and hold to a different belief than an unproven , untested theory ?<-->O
Good question .<-->N
Children should be taught that evolution is only a theory and to see that a theory is not the same as a scientific law like Newton s Three Laws of Motion .<-->N
Freedom of Speech I believe that students should have the option of stating their own beliefs and base them upon what findings they gain in their education .<-->O
Former President George Bush once said that Both sides ought to be properly taught so people can understand what the debate is about .<-->O
Part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought -LSB- and -RSB- people ought to be exposed to different ideas .<-->O
Academic freedom is what brought the theory of evolution to the classrooms in the first place and so what is wrong with the idea of allowing others to provide their views on how life came into being and if it did evolve or didn t evolve .<-->O
Shouldn t we let them freely express what they believe and provide the reasons for why they believe what they do believe ?<-->O
Good science has always allowed for controversy in the classroom and so educators should allow for rational scientific discussion and criticisms of the theory of evolution .<-->O
By the way , educators should not state that evidence for Darwinian evolution is overwhelming and indisputable .<-->O
Evolution is Bad Science Mankind used to believe that the earth was flat and that if a ship sailed too far it would end up falling off the edge of the earth .<-->O
That is because we believed only with our eyes .<-->N
The theory of evolution is much like this in that a theory or belief is taught as scientific fact because of what they perceive even though nothing could be further from the truth .<-->O
Teaching evolution as fact is just plain bad science .<-->O
Evolution is closer to a philosophy than it is a science .<-->N
One example is that mutations are a good thing .<-->N
I heard about a dairy farmer who had a dairy cow that gave birth to a calf with two heads .<-->N
That is a mutation .<-->N
The problem was that the calf died since it was sending different signals to its digestive system and survived for only a few days .<-->N
If you had asked the dairy farmer if that mutation was an advantage , he would have said no because the calf died .<-->N
I have never seen or heard of a mutation where it helped the specie propagate or survive and become a better organism .<-->O
If you asked biologists if mutations are a good thing , they might give you a funny look because mutations are basically a change that takes place in the nucleotide sequence within the genome of an organism .<-->O
These mutations are the result of DNA or DNA genomes that were unrepaired and will lead to errors in the replication process of additional cells .<-->N
Even so , evolutionists claim that mutations are how life forms eventually evolve into a new life form .<-->N
Evolution requires positive mutations , which are so rare that scientists have problems finding them in nature .<-->O
What they do find are mutations that are extremely harmful and sometimes fatal to the organism .<-->O
In order for evolution to work it needs an increase in information by means of positive mutations .<-->N
The only problem is they can t find where this occurs by natural means .<-->N
Another good example of bad science in the theory of evolution is that they keep claiming to find missing links and that these links are the smoking gun of evidence in the fossil layer .<-->N
The only roaring evidence is the roaring silence in the fossil record .<-->N
This was exactly the reason that Darwin had great doubts in his theory because he couldn t find any transitional fossils showing evidence that specie evolved into other life forms .<-->O
And how do they explain the Cambrian explosion or the Cambrian rock , where there are exceedingly few fossils that come before the Cambrian layers .<-->N
There are primarily only three such fossils and they lay adjacent to the Cambrian layer , as close in fact as to almost appear in that layer .<-->O
One example is the Cloudina and Namacalathus mineral tubular fossils .<-->N
Despite the claim that they are millions of years old they remain virtually unchanged today from when they first appeared !<-->F
Then there are the Mollusc-like Kimberella and its trace fossils -LRB- also unchanged as of today -RRB- and then the Mollusc-like Kimberella and its trace fossils .<-->N
Needless to say , these too have not changed at all .<-->N
Why haven t they evolved or changed by increased information as a result of positive mutations ?<-->N
Incidentally , the Cloudina are the oldest known evidence in the fossil record of the calcified skeletal formation in metazoans , a prominent feature in animals appearing in the Early Cambrian and not before .<-->N
There is also good fossil evidence that exists for the appearance of gastropods , cephalopods and bivalves which are classified as Mollusc-like Kimberella and its trace fossils , which by the way , are also found in the Cambrian period .<-->N
Recently , the fossil record of the earliest animals from the Ediacaran to the Cambrian was made but the dating and interpretation of these remain controversial .<-->N
As Wikipedia has stated , The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian fauna , seemingly abruptly and from nowhere , centers on three key points : whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian ; what might have caused such rapid change ; and what it would imply about the origin and evolution of animals .<-->O
Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence , based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks .<-->O
So , it is not only up to interpretation but this interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence and it is based mainly on incomplete fossil records and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks .<-->O
The words interpretation and the fact that there is a limited supply of evidence due to an incomplete fossil record sound highly speculative and subjective at best .<-->O
Conclusion Part of the reason that creationism or at least , intelligent design should be allowed to be discussed in the classroom is because evolution presents a world view without God and that there is only survival of the fittest and that there is no real purpose for mankind other than eat , drink , and be merry for tomorrow we die .<-->O
The theory of evolution portrays mankind as only a collection of molecules as a result of blind , accidental chance with the only reason we were born was to survive .<-->O
God did create us for a purpose and it wasn t to be moved up to the highest order on the food chain .<-->N
It was to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever .<-->N
We have a purpose in life and God s will is that we believe in the Son of God .<-->O
To reject God as Creator is to imply that God did not create except by random chance or blind occurrences by way of evolution or that there is no Creator at all which denies reality -LRB- Rom 1:20 Psalm 19:1 -RRB- .<-->O
Creationism should be taught but it should begin at home .<-->N
Those who claim that God used evolution to complete His creation are robbing God of glory and God will not ever share His glory with another -LRB- Isaiah 42:8 -RRB- .<-->O
----------- 6 .<-->N
The Bible v. the Constitution Politicians , school boards , principals , and teachers are pushing creationism on kids .<-->N
T hen a student in Louisiana opens her textbook in biology class , she might not have the standard Miller and Levine Biology with a dragonfly on the cover , and she might not ever learn about evolution .<-->O
For some Louisiana public school students , their science textbook is the Bible , and in biology class they read the Book of Genesis to learn the creation point of view .<-->O
Through a public records request , I obtained dozens of emails from the Bossier Parish school district that specifically discuss teaching creationism .<-->N
Shawna Creamer , a science teacher at Airline High School , sent an email to the principal , Jason Rowland , informing him of which class periods she would use to teach creationism .<-->N
We will read in Genesis and them -LSB- sic -RSB- some supplemental material debunking various aspects of evolution from which the students will present , Creamer wrote .<-->O
In another email exchange with Rowland , a parent had complained that a different teacher , Cindy Tolliver , actually taught that evolution was a fact .<-->O
This parent complained that Tolliver was pushing her twisted religious beliefs onto the class .<-->N
Principal Rowland responded , I can assure you this will not happen again .<-->O
Another email was sent by Bossier High School assistant principal Doug Scott to Michael Stacy , a biology teacher at that school .<-->N
I enjoyed the visit to your class today as you discussed evolution and creationism in a full spectrum of thought , Scott wrote .<-->N
Thank you for the rich content as you bring various sources to bear in your curriculum .<-->O
The Louisiana Science Education Act , passed by the state legislature in 2008 , permits science teachers to use supplemental materials to critique evolution , opening a backdoor that these teachers are using , as intended , to teach creationism .<-->N
Such lessons are allowed under this Louisiana law , but they are illegal under federal law .<-->N
We know that one in eight high school biology teachers advocate for creationism , even though it 's unconstitutional , says Josh Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education .<-->O
These emails make clear that many teachers are interpreting the Louisiana Science Education Act as allowing such unconstitutional and scientifically-misleading lessons .<-->O
On April 22 the Louisiana Senate Education Committee voted on a bill to repeal the Science Education Act , referred to by many on both sides as the creationism act .<-->N
This was the fifth vote since 2010 , and legislators voted 4 3 to keep creationism in Louisiana classrooms .<-->F
In April , here at Slate , I published evidence that creationism was being widely taught in Louisiana schools .<-->F
During the Education Committee hearing to repeal the Science Education Act , I provided that research to the chairman of the committee , Sen. Conrad Appel .<-->F
It included a letter from more than 20 Ouachita Parish science teachers who said they were teaching the discrepancies of evolution .<-->F
I guess Appel ignored the evidence , because he cast the deciding vote for creationism .<-->F
After the hearing I followed up with the Ouachita Parish school system to learn how the discrepancies in evolution were being taught .<-->F
I obtained a PowerPoint about the origin of life that is used in Ouachita Parish Junior High School s life science classes .<-->N
It presents evolution as just a theory and says that theories are possibly true but not known or proven to be true .<-->O
Creationism is also presented as a theory and given equal footing with evolution .<-->N
Students are taught that the -LSB- b -RSB- asis for creationism is founded in Genesis of the Bible , and Creationism relies on the claim that there is a purpose to all creation known only to the creator .<-->N
Louisiana politicians have supported the Science Education Act because they intended it to allow creationism in the classroom .<-->N
Gov. Bobby Jindal , who signed the Science Education Act , said it was for creationism .<-->N
What are we scared of ?<-->N
Jindal asked .<-->N
State Sen. Ben Nevers said he sponsored it in the Senate because creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin 's theory . ''<-->F
In April state Rep. Frank Hoffmann , a state House sponsor , confirmed the law was for creationism .<-->N
The Ouachita Citizen reported that Hoffmann told it that Louisiana science curriculum policy recommended a scientific discussion in the classroom of scientific theories including creationism and evolution .<-->N
Legislators have used the act to pressure school districts into teaching creationism .<-->N
In repeated emails to the Bossier Parish school district , state Rep. Thomas Carmody -LRB- who co-sponsored the Science Education Act -RRB- asked how the district was complying with his law .<-->N
I appreciate your expediting the confirmation of your district 's effort to comply with the stipulations outlined in the Louisiana Science Education Act , Carmody wrote .<-->N
School boards have also used the act to push for creationism .<-->N
At a 2010 Caddo Parish School Board meeting , board member Steve Riall said he knows the Governor has granted permission for districts in Louisiana to give equal value in teaching evolution and creationism , according to the meeting s minutes .<-->N
And creationism certainly is being taught in Caddo Parish schools .<-->N
Charlotte Hinson , a fifth-grade teacher at Caddo s Eden Gardens Magnet School , wrote a column for the Shreveport Times in which she declared : My job is to present both -LSB- evolution and creationism -RSB- because God made science .<-->N
In an email to a Bossier teacher , Hinson said that despite a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union warning against teaching creationism , she had the support of local lawyers , her principal , and the school board .<-->O
The principal and school board reminded me I did nothing wrong , she wrote .<-->N
Times are getting harder and harder ... . .<-->N
I feel the end is near .<-->N
Be blessed !!!<-->N
The Bossier Parish teacher exchanging emails with Hinson was Carolyn Goodwin , who teaches at Stockwell Place Elementary and is also a creationist .<-->N
Bossier -LSB- school district -RSB- has it s -LSB- sic -RSB- problems but there are so many awesome Christians from the top down , Goodwin wrote to Hinson .<-->O
We pray at school functions and probably break the law all the time !!<-->N
Louisiana school districts are clearly breaking the law all the time , but the Louisiana Legislature still refuses to repeal the Science Education Act .<-->N
These newly released emails , from districts across the state , show that this law is being used systematically to teach creationism in public schools .<-->N
This puts Louisiana on a collision course with a First Amendment lawsuit .<-->F
I asked Andrew Seidel , a lawyer for the Freedom From Religion Foundation , which litigates separation of church and state cases , about the legal situation surrounding the law .<-->N
It was clear when the -LSB- Science Education Act -RSB- was passed that it was just another shameful attempt to circumvent the First Amendment , Seidel told me .<-->O
He went on to warn teachers against teaching creationism , and said , No state law , including the Louisiana Science Education Act , can shield public schools and public school teachers from liability for violating the U.S. Constitution .<-->O
Several separation of church and state advocacy groups , including the FFRF and the ACLU , have their eye on Louisiana .<-->N
All it will take is for one Louisiana parent or student to sue the state for endorsing religion in public school , and teaching creationism will become illegal again .<-->O
But for the moment , because Louisiana politicians refuse to take action , Louisiana students are reading Genesis in science class .<-->N
Zack Kopplin is a science education activist who has fought against creationism being taught with public money .<-->N

Why Creationism Should Not Be Taught As Science Part 2 .<-->F
The Educational Issues One can ask a number of questions about creationism : Is it a religion ?<-->F
Is it scientific ?<-->F
Is it legal to teach it in the public schools ?<-->F
Would it be practical to include it in the science curriculum ?<-->N
This article deals with the last of these questions , looking at the educational consequences of creation teachings being given `` equal time '' in public school science .<-->N
The legal , scientific , and , especially , religious issues are not ignored , however , for they have a direct effect on this very pragmatic issue of insuring an adequate education for public school students .<-->O
The Importance of Religion Religions play a significant role in our society , particularly those relying on the Judeo-Christian Bible .<-->N
Furthermore , those faiths promoting various literal interpretations of that book are becoming among the most vocal in the nation .<-->N
To neglect this fact in the public school curriculum , to give religion no place whatever , would imply either a myopic or anti-religious outlook .<-->O
Therefore it is only reasonable that religion , the Bible , and , yes , even Special Creation , should have its place in the education of our youth .<-->O
This idea was well expressed by Jerry Bergman in the February , 1980 Acts & Facts , published by the Institute for Creation Research .<-->N
He wrote , `` The very fact that we usually do not mention religion or religious issues means that we are teaching very definite ideas about religion , especially that religion is not important ... To say that the schools can teach the entire world of knowledge but must exclude religion is censorship of the worst sort ... There is no academic freedom where every area of knowledge can be taught except one ... '' Dr. Bergman then went on to add , `` If schools are to be a place where students can debate important questions , it would seem that eliminating religious questions would shelter students from an important area of debate which is crucial for living a well-rounded life . ''<-->O
- page 7 - It is refreshing to see such a liberal -LRB- dare I say humanistic ? -RRB-<-->O
idea appear in one of the most radical creationist journals of wide circulation .<-->O
Dr. Bergman seems to be advocating classes in comparative religion , comparative anthropology , comparative sociology , or their like .<-->N
So am I .<-->N
A Category Mistake Since religious liberals and conservatives both agree that comparative religion belongs in the public schools , where is the point of contention ?<-->O
It is simply this : Creationists , including Dr. Bergman , would like to see religion , at least in the form of Special Creation , brought into the science classroom .<-->O
And though some creationists have attempted to demonstrate that `` scientific '' creationism is not religious , Dr. Bergman apparently has not .<-->N
In the aforementioned article he wrote , `` Religion is a belief structure , and all fields of knowledge are based on belief structures , even though some fields of knowledge include more empirical content than others . ''<-->O
This would seem to mean he thinks any religious implications should be forthrightly discussed in every subject area .<-->O
Certainly Christian Heritage College -LRB- a division of which is the Institute for Creation Research -RRB- does this .<-->N
There is n't one course of study offered where the Bible is n't a textbook , a point the college boasts of in its catalog -LRB- Christian Heritage Courier , 1979 -RRB- .<-->N
But is this effort to religify every subject , from physical education to wood shop , practical for the public schools ?<-->N
Not unless our idea of practical includes pinpointing the religious differences between students so they can form their battle lines and create campus strife .<-->O
And there is an interesting contradiction here , too .<-->O
If Bergman is trying to deny that a line can be drawn between the sacred and secular in education , we must ask if he is using the Constitution to support this .<-->O
Most creationists cite the Constitution for their own ends .<-->N
But the very Constitution cited draws just the sort of line between sacred and secular that Bergman seems to deny !<-->O
It would make more sense , then , to keep separate studies separate .<-->N
Religion , including various creation stories , should be taught in a suitable context of its own and not miscategorized in the science curriculum .<-->N
And within that context , each creation myth and each philosophy of origins should get equal time with the others .<-->N
This would successfully meet the creationist demand for equal time on religious grounds , and ought to end that part of the battle .<-->O
Theories of Education But what about the demand for equal time on scientific grounds ?<-->N
Assuming , for the sake of argument , that creationism is non-religious , that it attempts to offer evidence in support of its conclusions , and that it is a competing theory to evolution , should n't it be heard ?<-->O
- page 8 - How one answers this question is determined by how one views education .<-->N
If the purpose of the public schools is to be a forum for every possible scientific and non-scientific theory , if the job of teachers is to merely expose students to the various trends in our society , and various fringe theories , then creationism definitely has a place in the science curriculum .<-->O
But this implies there is no such thing as knowledge , or at least there are no reliable experts who can be depended on to tell us any facts .<-->O
After all , if the student is left to sort truth from falsehood , fact from fallacy , then there must be nothing the teachers feel confident enough about to forthrightly teach .<-->O
If schools are to be debating societies , then the administration must take a totally non-committal position on what is true , and merely give equal time to all competing opinions .<-->O
This would be an exercise of radical skepticism or insecurity .<-->O
On the other hand , if education , in large part , amounts to passing on the discovered knowledge of one generation to the next , and if there is such a thing we can label as `` knowledge , '' and if we accept there are some people who have more of this knowledge in certain areas than other people , then creationism could not be included .<-->O
This is because , at present , the consensus of knowledgeable scientists in the fields related to evolution maintains there is simply no serious ground for holding creationism to be true .<-->O
The evidence creationism is based upon has been found insufficient .<-->N
Now , parents have a right to choose , through the ballot box , the sort of public education they want for their children , the quality of school officials they will support in office .<-->O
But , if they accept the `` back to basics '' model of education , if they want their children learning facts and not merely toying with opinions , then there is no ground for them approving `` equal time '' for creationism in the science curriculum .<-->O
This is a bitter pill to take for many .<-->N
They see `` equal time '' as something American as apple pie .<-->N
And it is , around election time .<-->N
But education which imparts factual knowledge is not a political campaign , it is a learning experience .<-->O
And truth is not determined by majority vote , but by the merits of the case .<-->N
Creationists , however , have two ready answers to this point .<-->O
They either claim creationism is being discriminated against in the scientific community and so is not given a fighting chance to get its voice heard -LRB- evolutionists are narrow-minded bigots -RRB- , or they charge that evolution is actually not accepted as much as people think -LRB- it is a `` club secret '' among scientists that evolution is bankrupt -RRB- .<-->O
To answer these charges will require a separate article on the science issues .<-->N
Suffice it to say here that this is the same tactic used by most all the pseudoscientific charlatans in the business .<-->N
If their views are rejected , usually because of poor evidence , they shout `` conspiracy '' and go directly to the public .<-->O
It is an easy thing to reject standards when one 's theory does n't measure up .<-->N
It is an easy step to take the political route when one 's theory is n't hearty enough to make it over the rocky road of science .<-->O
- page 9 - So , in the context of a basic education system that recognizes the existence of knowledge and a body of professionals who have a consensus on some subjects , the introduction of `` scientific creationism '' into the science classroom would only open a can-of-worms .<-->O
Soon every crackpot theory that had adherents enough to start a lobby would have to be included .<-->N
Here 's a probable list : 1 .<-->N
Astrology would be granted equal time with astronomy .<-->F
Pyramid power would be matched side-by-side with modern physics .<-->O
Divining rod technology would be taken seriously for the benefit of future oil geologists and hydraulic engineers .<-->O
The toxemia theory and Christian Science `` negative thinking '' theory of disease would get equal time with the germ theory .<-->O
The flat earth theory would get equal mention with the space program .<-->N
It would be easy to go on , but let 's stop and detail this last one just to show how serious the issue really is and how similar the demands of these other theorists might be to those of the creationists .<-->O
Leveling with the Geographers Charles K. Johnson is president of the International Flat Earth Research Society , an organization of 1500 members , many of whom are doctors , lawyers , and other professional and educated people .<-->N
He holds that scientific evidence supports the flat earth hypothesis , and , like creationists , appeals to `` well known '' and `` easily observable '' facts .<-->O
One sample bit of observable evidence for his position is the flatness of water .<-->N
Anyone can see that water is flat .<-->N
Therefore , if you expand on what you see right in front of you , the only possible conclusion is a flat earth !<-->O
Experimental evidence for this disc shaped plane also abounds .<-->N
For example , when Columbus sailed to America -LRB- and Columbus is one of the heroes of the flat-earthers -RRB- , he did n't fall off like his men thought he would .<-->O
This is because the earth is not a globe .<-->N
Johnson 's wife , Marjory , comes from Australia , and Johnson declares , `` She 's sworn out an affidavit that she never hung by her feet in Australia .<-->N
She sailed a ship over here , and she did not get on it upside down and she did not sail straight up .<-->O
She sailed straight across the ocean .<-->N
We consider that a very important proof that the world is flat . ''<-->O
To further complicate matters , Johnson sees the flat earth idea as a religious issue too .<-->O
No doubt he can quote chapter and verse to show that the Bible , properly understood , supports his position .<-->O
`` The Bible is a great tangle of history and corruption and so forth , '' he says , `` but the aim of it all is a one-world , flat-Earth society , for honesty and decency and that sort of thing . ''<-->O
Certainly his view could be mentioned in comparative religion .<-->N
Although Johnson is n't hard at work lobbying or fighting court cases , he has gotten his view heard in the public schools .<-->O
For example , he addressed students at Beverly Hills High School on at least one occasion , and with the continuing good press he is getting he is likely to have other opportunities .<-->O
NBC and the National Enquirer , not to mention local radio talk shows and newspapers all over the country have given his Society coverage .<-->N
- page 10 - The reason why so many believe the world is a globe , Johnson notes , is because science is promoting `` a fraud to keep the common people in the dark . ''<-->O
The Apollo moon program was just a movie .<-->O
`` Arthur C. Clarke wrote it and directed it .<-->N
But he knows the Earth is flat . ''<-->N
It seems the only redeeming feature of the globular theory is that it provides jobs .<-->N
To get the truth out , Johnson publishes the Flat Earth Quarterly `` with the objective to restore the world 's sanity . ''<-->O
`` We consider this the world 's most superstitious age , '' Johnson states .<-->O
`` We try to get people to use their minds logically . ''<-->N
-LRB- Schadewald , 1977 ; Ashland Tidings , 1978 . -RRB-<-->F
Theories of Origins Obviously , the creationists do n't have the only alternate science in town .<-->N
But let 's narrow our focus a bit and concentrate on just the teaching of scientific hypotheses about origins .<-->O
Here the creationists maintain there are only two basic views : creation and evolution .<-->N
Because many would disagree , let 's list some of the other possibilities : 1 .<-->N
Sudden appearance of chaos from nothing , and out of chaos come the gods who create man and the animals .<-->O
-LRB- Hesiod 's Theogony is an example of this . -RRB-<-->N
Sudden appearance of something superior which is now in a state of decline .<-->O
Gradual growth of something inferior into a state of perfection .<-->O
Cyclical fluctuation between perfection and imperfection .<-->N
An eternal and unchanging universe in which all apparent changes are only local and minor .<-->O
When faced with a list like this , creationists attempt to label everything listed as being evolutionary in some way , usually noting that all have some sort of gradual change present .<-->N
The same criterion , though , would place Special Creation in the evolution pile as well .<-->O
This is because Special Creation is like number 2 , particularly in how the theory requires a declining cosmos in its interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics .<-->O
Nonetheless , whenever the point is raised that there are other theories of origins , and particularly other Biblically based theories , the creationists disagree .<-->O
They regard the various efforts to `` harmonize science with scripture '' as acts of surrender .<-->O
It is their position that the harmonizing theories say nothing scientifically different from modern evolution .<-->N
That is , they make no unique predictions and appeal to no unique evidence ; they are simply efforts to fit the Bible into the theories of modern science .<-->O
For this reason , Special Creationists refuse to call these theories creation theories at all -LRB- there is only one true creation theory -RRB- .<-->O
- page 11 - Dr. Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research made this plain in a debate on the religious issues with Dr. Jerry Albert in 1977 , when he said , `` We can drop this term ` Special Creationist ' and ` Theistic Evolutionist . '<-->N
You are either a creationist or you are an evolutionist , you ca n't be both . ''<-->N
That Dr. Gish 's way of viewing these theories is inaccurate can be shown if we approach each Bible based theory in its turn .<-->N
Alternate Views from Genesis The Day-Age Theory : This is the position that each `` day '' of creation in the Genesis account actually represents a `` long period '' rather than a typical 24hour solar cycle .<-->O
Some denominations give specific lengths of time to these periods , quoting II Peter , 3:8 , which says '' ... one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day . ''<-->N
However , most Day-Age theorists prefer to be less specific and allow for millions of years .<-->O
What makes this theory unique is its predictions regarding the fossil record .<-->N
To be verified , it would only have to be shown there was evidence in the rocks of six separate creation epochs , coinciding with the events of each of the six days of scripture .<-->N
This means six separate and distinct creations -LRB- which may or may not have been followed by subsequent evolutions -RRB- .<-->N
It is clear this theory does not harmonize with evolutionary geology .<-->N
This is so because it requires a different order of events than evolutionists posit .<-->N
Even creationist Henry Morris sees this .<-->F
On pages 56 to 62 of Biblical Cosmology and Modern Science , he lists 25 discrepancies between Genesis and the evolutionary sequences .<-->N
So serious is this problem , it has caused Day-Age Biblical theorist Davis A. Young to propose that the `` days '' of Genesis actually overlap each other .<-->O
`` If such overlap exists , then all apparent discrepancies between Genesis 1 and science would fall away . ''<-->O
-LRB- Young , 1977 . -RRB-<-->N
The Day-Age theory also does not harmonize with creationist geology .<-->N
This is because it does n't require that most all the fossils be laid down in a single year of world-wide flooding .<-->N
Therefore , in the light of all this evidence , it appears the Day-Age theory is indeed a unique hypothesis deserving as much public school time as does Special Creation .<-->O
The Gap Theory : This is the position that there is a gap between the first and second verses of Genesis .<-->N
The result is two distinct creations .<-->N
The first creation involved all the now extinct life forms , like the dinosaurs , and the second , occurring in six solar days six thousand years ago , involved all the life forms we see today .<-->N
Since the prehistoric animals were destroyed in a catastrophe other than Noah 's Flood , flood geology is not as important in this model as it is in Special Creation .<-->N
However , since they were not destroyed by the normal processes of change and gradual extinction , evolutionary theory plays an even smaller part .<-->N
- page 12 - This makes the Gap Theory unique .<-->N
And the fact that it has two creations , rather than the six of the Day-Age Theory , proves it even more distinctive .<-->O
It predicts that no fossil animals should be found this side of the second creation of six thousand years ago unless there is evidence that such animals were separately re-created .<-->N
Special Creationists do n't like this theory because it accepts the idea of an old earth .<-->N
However , like Special Creation , it accepts fixity of species and uses the standard creationist arguments to prove organic evolution is `` impossible . ''<-->O
Its flood model differs scientifically in one major respect from that of Special Creation .<-->O
That is , it claims only `` modern '' animals died in the deluge .<-->N
Adherents of this unique viewpoint include the Jehovah 's Witnesses and Armstrong 's Worldwide Church of God , both being religions that claim to be truly literal in their interpretation of scripture , and both being strong propagandizers against evolution and for creation .<-->O
If Special Creationists get equal time , so should these people .<-->N
Progressive Creation : This is the theory that God continually creates new things .<-->N
There is no evolution .<-->N
The evidence creationists constantly cite about gaps in the fossil record actually supports this theory better than it does that of Special Creation .<-->O
This is because unexplained gaps seem to point to the Creator intervening in each gap , not to a one-shot recent creation .<-->O
In fact , this theory can accommodate the existence of the geological column much better than can Special Creation -LRB- which depends on a turbulent flood to stack up the strata so nicely -RRB- .<-->O
Frequent evidences of catastrophism over time are another support for this theory which runs against the grain of the Special Creationists ' singular catastrophic flood .<-->O
But this also puts it out of step with evolution , which rejects the notion that catastrophes coincide with every gap , and that all gaps are unexplainable without divine intervention .<-->O
So , both Special Creation and Progressive Creation interpret the scientific evidence differently from each other and from evolution .<-->N
Furthermore , both religious models also differ in theology .<-->N
This can only mean that Progressive Creation , too , must be heard in any discussion of origins which introduces alternate models .<-->O
An Old Earth The `` compromise with evolution '' these theories really seem to make is the acceptance of a very old earth ; nothing more .<-->O
Is this grounds for the ICR creationists to take adherents of these theories to task ?<-->N
Not at all , because ICR creationists have , on other occasions , shown apparent tolerance for these viewpoints , indicating they are `` open '' to this old earth option .<-->O
- page 13 - In particular , the narration that goes with slide 48 of Creation and Evolution : A Comparison of Two Scientific Models -LRB- an audio-visual aid for public schools put out by ICR -RRB- , declares : `` The creation model does not require an immensity of time .<-->N
The Creator could have accomplished creation in six days , six billion years , or instantaneously .<-->N
A young age for the earth and a recent creation are thus options open for consideration by creationists , who are not committed to evolutionary uniformitarian geology . ''<-->O
This seems to imply that evolutionists are dogmatic , but creationists are flexible and able to consider more than one option .<-->O
Do they mean it ?<-->N
Is this why they rarely debate the age of the earth , but prefer to ignore that point and get on to other things ?<-->O
Or is this deceptive ?<-->N
If they are open , they should n't criticize `` theistic evolutionists , '' who are also open and offering an option .<-->O
But if their model requires a young earth , they should always say so , and slide 48 should n't say what it does .<-->O
One thing is clear , however .<-->N
They ca n't have it both ways in the public schools .<-->N
They ca n't be `` open '' to `` options '' and still dogmatically declare there are only two possibilities .<-->N
They ca n't throw `` theistic evolutionists '' in the evolution category simply because these people are willing to accept an old earth .<-->O
But Dr. Morris , the Director of ICR , seems to settle this question on page 71 of Biblical Cosmology and Modern Science when he vigorously proclaims , `` It is high time that Christians face the fact that the so-called geologic ages are essentially synonymous with the evolutionary theory of origins .<-->O
That latter in turn is , at its ultimate roots , the anti-God conspiracy of Satan himself ! ''<-->N
-LRB- Morris , 1970 . -RRB-<-->N
This quote , however , is ten years old .<-->N
To be fair , what has he said lately ?<-->N
Well , in a cover letter to the March , 1980 Acts & Facts , Morris writes : One of the greatest obstacles to the return of real creation teaching in our nation is the indifference of so many Christian people to the issue .<-->O
They often justify this attitude on the basis of their assumption that people can believe in theistic evolution -LRB- or progressive creation -RRB- and still believe in the Bible .<-->O
They feel that the evolutionary ages of geology can somehow be accommodated in Genesis , by means -LRB- usually -RRB- of the `` local flood '' interpretation of the Noahic Deluge and the `` day/age '' interpretation of God 's week of creation .<-->N
That honest and consistent Biblical exegesis excludes this interpretation is clearly demonstrated in ... the enclosed March issue of Acts and Facts .<-->O
I hope this study will encourage large numbers of sincere Christians everywhere to take a more forthright , Scripture-honoring stand on true creationism .<-->O
In analyzing this general creationist attitude Dr. Richard Haas , in a statement signed by six other biologists at Fresno State College in 1972 , hit the nail right on the head .<-->O
- page 14 - He wrote : `` It seems clear that the attempted inclusion of creationism stems from individuals convinced that not only is creationism a viable alternative doctrine equivalent in scientific validity to the concept of organic evolution , but implicit in the requirement is the assumption that the Judeo-Christian fundamentalist approach is the sole such alternative ... It seems clear to us that this requirement reflects an arrogance that supposes that Judeo-Christian tradition is the sole valid framework within which one answers questions of ultimate cause while the myriad of other theological systems adhered to by men past and contemporary are not worthy of consideration .<-->O
This is clear , for , if it were not the assumption , obviously any teacher would be obliged to consider all alternative creationist doctrines , a task that would occupy all his time . ''<-->O
-LRB- Haas , 1972 . -RRB-<-->N
Alternate Religious Views But it does n't stop there .<-->F
Other religions have theories of origins which also make scientifically testable predictions .<-->F
Let 's look at a few of these : The Hare Krishnas are creationists of a sort .<-->N
They have their own creation research group , called the Bhaktivedanta Institute , which sends out periodic blasts at evolution and gives arguments in support of their theory of `` production . ''<-->O
As Jnana Dasa -LRB- 1979 -RRB- in Back to Godhead magazine explains it , `` This theory proposes that biological forms do not arise from the spontaneous self-organization of matter , but rather under the direction of a superior intelligence .<-->O
Furthermore , it suggests that life and consciousness are not material phenomena , the results of physiochemical reactions .<-->N
Instead , they result from a distinct , irreducible , nonphysical principle or entity , which is present within the material body during an individual 's lifetime , and whose departure from the body leads to the change called death . ''<-->O
This nonphysical entity , the `` Supersoul , '' is indestructible and eternal , a `` particle of spiritual energy '' that has neither birth nor death , but simply passes from physical body to physical body in a process of reincarnation .<-->O
Some of the evidence used to support this view is much the same as the negative evidence Special Creationists use against evolution .<-->O
Krishnas talk about probability , `` living fossils , '' lack of transitional forms , lack of conceivable transitional forms , necessity of design and intelligence in nature , and the inability of scientists to turn matter into consciousness .<-->O
On the positive side , however , are appeals to quantum physics .<-->N
Here the Krishnas are looking for consciousness amid the subatomic particles , as are authors Fritjof Capra -LRB- The Tao of Physics -RRB- and Gary Zukav -LRB- The Dancing Wu Li Masters -RRB- .<-->N
They bring the evidence of modern physics into play in order to demonstrate their agreement with British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington , who declared `` the stuff of the world is mind-stuff . ''<-->N
- page 15 - The Krishnas , after satisfying themselves that `` the nonexistence of intermediate biological forms implies some kind of absolute information or guidance that transcends the categories of ordinary science , '' go on to propose how contact with this `` transcendental source '' can be made .<-->O
The avenue `` consists of an elaborate scientific method for establishing a personal relationship with the Supreme .<-->N
This method , called bhakti-yoga , is quite similar to modern science , in that it depends on clearly specified procedures leading to reproducible results .<-->O
It is experimentally verifiable , for it is based on direct personal experience attainable by anyone who carries out the procedures correctly . ''<-->O
-LRB- Thompson , 1979 . -RRB-<-->N
Whether most scientists would find this approach scientific is not to the point .<-->O
Obviously the Krishnas and other mystics think it is , and therefore would probably want it seriously considered in the science curriculum .<-->O
A similar position is held by Scientology , giving mysticism even more clout .<-->O
Scientologists reject evolution as a view that `` promotes man as nothing but an animal evolved from mud . ''<-->O
But they also reject traditional Christianity , saying , `` Man does not have a spirit - he is a spirit . ''<-->O
-LRB- Rev. Wolery , 1977 . -RRB-<-->N
Buddhism presents an interesting paradox because it is an eastern religion which easily accepts biological evolution .<-->N
This is because Buddhists reject the notion of an immaterial soul and tend in many ways to be materialists .<-->O
Most Buddhist sects also reject notions of God .<-->N
Yet the discoveries in modern physics interest them as much as they interest the Krishnas , though they might put somewhat different interpretations on them .<-->O
The main cause of life , they maintain , is desire , and this could conceivably be understood in some physical , and hence testable , way .<-->O
The Mormons have a special problem all their own .<-->N
In addition to being Day-Age theorists -LRB- God lives on the planet Kolob which rotates on its axis once for every thousand years of earth time , hence a day to God is a thousand years to us -RRB- , Mormons are also rejecters of ex nihilo creation .<-->N
Joseph Smith made it plain in the King Follett sermon when he said , `` Now , the word create came from the word baurau , which does not mean to create out of nothing ; it means to organize ; the same as a man would organize materials and build a ship .<-->O
Hence we infer that God had materials to organize the world out of chaos choate matter , which is element , and in which dwells all the glory . ''<-->O
-LRB- Swyhart , 1976 . -RRB-<-->N
This view might also require equal time in science classrooms .<-->O
Because House Bill 690 of the Georgia State Legislature defined `` scientific creationism '' as '' ... the belief , based upon scientific principle , that there was a time in the past when all matter , energy , and life , and their processes and relationships were created ex nihilo and fixed by creative and intelligent design . ''<-->O
If other bills attempt to do the same thing , then the Mormon position will have to be viewed as a specie of evolution , a view Mormons surely will not tolerate .<-->O
-LRB- They are among the leaders in the effort to get creationism into the public schools . -RRB-<-->N
Therefore , creation from nothing and from something will both have to be considered .<-->N
- page 16 - Other Classroom Subjects So far we have only been dealing with the science curriculum .<-->N
Yet the issue goes far beyond that .<-->F
In 1976 , Creation Life Publishers put out a creationist school history textbook .<-->N
One of the authors , Mary Stanton , wrote in the March 1977 Acts & Facts that teleology , or God 's guiding purpose , must be included in history studies .<-->N
She sees history and the Bible as `` two of God 's media for revelation . ''<-->N
An advertisement for this Public School text , which is called Streams of Civilization , says the book offers : `` Sound Christian teaching of history .<-->N
The great men of the scriptures take their rightful places .<-->O
Presents Noah and the flood as historical fact .<-->N
Shows Jesus as more than just a man . ''<-->N
-LRB- Institute for Creation Research , 1976 . -RRB-<-->N
Yet , as if this were n't enough , Stanton opens up the biggest can-of-worms of all by pointing an accusing finger at historians who `` continue to make Rome the first center of the Church , '' and who `` give credit to Rome for establishing the solid foundation of Christianity and for spreading the Gospel during the first centuries after Pentecost . ''<-->O
-LRB- Stanton , 1977 . -RRB-<-->N
Her book , of course , changes the emphasis to the Byzantines , a fact that will guarantee a counter equal-time demand by Roman Catholics .<-->O
What may be good religion to the protestant fundamentalist is clearly not good secular history for public schools in a pluralistic society .<-->O
The Creation Explanation by Robert Kofahl and Kelly Segraves is another creationist book that talks about history .<-->N
Although this volume is n't intended for public school use , and although it is primarily about science , it does illustrate the creationist position on historical matters .<-->O
On page 116 it speaks about the origin of human language in this wise : `` Scientific data from the languages of many tribal peoples reveal form as highly developed and structured as our own .<-->N
This suggests that while language has obviously changed with time , it has not necessarily been evolving upward from primitive simple language .<-->O
The biblical view is that man has had complex language from the beginning of the race . ''<-->N
On pages 117 and 118 the book goes on to challenge the idea of cultural evolution .<-->N
In typical creationist fashion , `` authorities '' are quoted to show the impossibility of early man developing from the hunting and gathering stage through the agricultural village stage to city-state civilizations .<-->N
`` In other words , the factual evidence for the evolutionary transition has not been discovered .<-->N
That it took place is , therefore , a matter of faith , not historical evidence . ''<-->O
To the creationist , civilization springs full blown on the scene from almost nowhere , leaving the Ark as the only possible explanation .<-->O
- page 17 - As creationists begin demanding a two model curriculum in history , as well as science , two novel alternate views of history immediately come to mind : 1 .<-->O
Erich Von Daniken has gained fame , and wealth , for his `` Chariots of the Gods '' theory .<-->N
In his view , `` ancient astronauts '' from other worlds were the source of most human societies and were instrumental in their development .<-->O
Another author , physicist Dr. Irwin Ginsburgh , goes even further and maintains that Adam and Eve were astronauts who landed on earth 6,000 years ago .<-->N
In his book , First , Man .<-->N
Then Adam !<-->F
, Dr. Ginsburgh maintains that the coming of Adam and Eve from another world pulled man out of the stone age .<-->F
Interbreeding between humans and these `` astronauts '' answers the age old question : `` Where did Adam 's sons find wives ? ''<-->F
-LRB- McCandlish , 1979 . -RRB-<-->F
Should this get equal time ?<-->F
Dr. Maxine Asher rejects Van Daniken 's hypothesis in favor of her own view that early civilizations sprang up from the remains left by the sinking of Atlantis 92,500 years ago .<-->O
This idea could easily appeal to the same historical evidence Kofahl and Segraves cite in The Creation Explanation .<-->O
In the view of Asher and other Atlantis searchers , modern civilization has not yet caught up to the level that was present on Atlantis in its heyday .<-->O
We could go on and branch out into still other subjects of study .<-->N
Then it would be necessary to have psychology students learning exorcism and spell casting .<-->O
Law students would have to get all the details on trial by ordeal and how to apply the water treatment for the detection of witches .<-->O
And , of course , let us not forget the stork theory of human reproduction as a requirement in sex education .<-->N
When Bette Chambers , president emeritus of the American Humanist Association , was asked in a recent TV interview why she would not favor teaching creation and evolution side-by-side , she replied , `` Because creationism is religion and evolution is science .<-->O
It 's mixing apples and oranges and coming up with fruit salad . ''<-->N
Of course we can see now how the introduction of creationism will lead to a fruitier salad than most people suspect , one that will have the schools teaching everything from primeval soup to nuts .<-->O
Startling Views of Creation Scientists At this point , some people will sneer incredulously , `` All that weird occult stuff is n't factual knowledge .<-->O
There 's no chance it will get into the school curriculum .<-->N
Who are you trying to kid with this alarmist scare tactic ? ''<-->O
But there is no kidding going on when one realizes that most of this material can already be found in most high school libraries , and when one sees that Transcendental Meditation , astrology , psychic phenomena , and UFO research have already been taught in some schools .<-->O
These ideas are all around us , students are thinking about them , as are their parents .<-->N
It is thus an easy thing for such subjects to find their way into the regular curriculum unless a decided effort is made to confine them to the library and possibly to classes in social science .<-->O
- page 18 - But even if we stick our heads in the sand and imagine such problems do n't exist , that such studies have no chance in the public schools , we must still face up to the `` weird '' teachings of the creationists themselves !<-->O
None of the fringe ideas previously mentioned can hold a candle to creationist astronomy .<-->N
The proof is in the reading .<-->N
On pages 66 and 67 of Remarkable Birth of Planet Earth , Dr. Henry Morris offers his explanation for the existence of certain astronomical oddities `` the fractures and scars on the moon and Mars , the shattered remnants of an erstwhile planet that became the asteroids , the peculiar rings of Saturn , the meteorite swarms ... reflect some kind of heavenly catastrophe associated either with Satan 's primeval rebellion or his continuing battle against Michael and his angels . ''<-->O
He adds ... `` Angels , both good and bad , can be shown Biblically to have considerable knowledge and power over natural processes and , thus can in many cases either cause or prevent physical catastrophes on earth and in the heavens .<-->O
In any event , this type of cause warrants further research as a potential explanation for apparent disturbances in the stars and planets since their creation . ''<-->O
-LRB- Emphasis added . -RRB-<-->N
Dr. Morris says objects in our solar system would behave oddly due to these star wars , `` in view of the heavy concentration of angels , both good and evil , around the planet Earth . ''<-->O
Morris even suggests that astrology is true due to `` evil spirits '' who live on the stars and use their demonic forces against the earth .<-->O
However , outside these angels and devils , Morris does n't believe in extraterrestrial life .<-->N
He explains it in this wise on page 63 : `` This possible association of angels with the stars , incidentally , is the only suggestion that Scripture makes concerning intelligent life on other worlds .<-->O
There are definitely no men , or man-like intelligences , living on other planets or , stars ... '' Perhaps this is why creationists often feel the space program is a waste of time .<-->O
Now , will creationism require equal time for this in astronomy and science courses ?<-->N
Must we keep our telescopic eyes peeled for Michael and his angels ?<-->N
And must we teach anti-science in the science classroom , inculcating apathy toward the space program and other scientific research that goes against the grain of creationists ?<-->O
Yes we must .<-->N
And we will also have to consider Dr. Duane Gish 's position that certain dinosaurs breathed fire .<-->O
And , since dinosaurs lived at the same time as man according to creationism , this accounts for the dragon legends that are mentioned in the mythologies of various world peoples -LRB- Gish , 1977 -RRB- .<-->N
- page 19 - One could list a whole catalogue of creationist oddities or `` weird ideas , '' ones that put pyramid power and the Loch Ness monster to shame !<-->O
-LRB- Oops , I forgot .<-->N
Creationists believe in the Loch Ness monster too .<-->O
The proof is in the 1979 Films for Christ production called The Great Dinosaur Mystery . -RRB-<-->N
A Matter of Academic Freedom In our day and age , classroom time in the sciences is at a premium , particularly in the secondary schools where the entire field must be covered in one junior or senior high school year .<-->O
With so much to teach , there is simply no room for side-issues , controversies scientists do n't take seriously , wild new proposals , and the like .<-->O
The student has his or her hands full just mastering the basic material .<-->O
Can you imagine losing half the time in two-model education ?<-->O
Can you imagine losing much more in the necessary multi-model education that would include astrology , Atlantis , the human aura , and the creation story of the Hopi Indians ?<-->O
So much time would be robbed placating these various pseudoscientific and religious groups that little time would remain for providing the learning necessary for students who wish to pursue careers in science .<-->O
The basic question is , should generally rejected theories about science get equal time with established positions which have the weight of evidence behind them and the consensus -LRB- or near unanimity -RRB- of scientists ?<-->O
Put another way , should any unestablished generally unaccepted theory get equal time with theories that had to go through the long process of proof and production of evidence ?<-->N
Creationists argue that giving their view equal time is just `` fair play . ''<-->O
But the idea of applying a `` fairness doctrine '' to science education reveals a lack of understanding of what science is about .<-->O
Science does n't work on `` fairness '' but on merit .<-->N
The position that has the best evidence , has withstood a long barrage of criticism , has been modified in the face of new data and is in harmony with it , and has the most support from knowledgeable workers in the field is the theory that should be given the emphasis in education .<-->O
Any other approach would imply that science is simply a matter of capricious opinion , and that one theory is just as good as another .<-->O
This may be true in religion , where the ideas can not be verified , but science is quite another matter .<-->O
This is why science can neither be treated on a `` fairness '' system nor mixed with religion .<-->N
Furthermore , it is contrary to the idea of academic freedom to attempt to mandate one minority group 's ideas of `` fairness '' in the public schools .<-->O
In some of the proposed `` two-model '' legislative bills , teachers not conforming to the creationist idea of fairness could expect fines or loss of jobs .<-->O
But the teaching of evolution is not similarly required or enforced .<-->N
As Mayer -LRB- 1978 -RRB- argues , `` It is a feature of academic freedom that the content of a discipline is not prescribed by law . ''<-->O
- page 20 - But , as with their approach to science , the creationists have an alternate view on academic freedom too .<-->O
To them , academic freedom means telling teachers what to do , where to do it , how to do it , and the degree to which it must be done .<-->N
But there is nothing free about setting such requirements or using intimidation in order to get a particular view added to the curriculum .<-->O
Nor is it academic freedom to force the teaching of every possible view on a subject .<-->O
Correctly defined , academic freedom is the freedom of the scientific community to establish by research and consensus what the most reasonable position is , and then to be allowed to present that position , without coercion or censorship , in the schools .<-->O
A Matter of Honesty But , aside from freedom there is the issue of credibility .<-->N
Jerry Bergman , in his booklet advocating equal time for creationism -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , correctly notes : `` Establishing teacher credibility requires presenting material in non-dogmatic ways according to the merits of the facts . ''<-->O
But this is not what equal time for creationism would do .<-->N
The `` merits of the facts '' happen to favor evolution .<-->O
But the two-model approach implies that informed scientific opinion is equally divided on the issue of origins .<-->N
To teach that this is the case when it is not , and when the evidence for evolution is clearly demonstrable , is to dishonestly mislead students .<-->O
Such an act is unethical and the betrayal of a public trust .<-->O
Furthermore , it is an irony when one considers that creationists profess to do this in the interest of increasing morality in society .<-->O
-LRB- Evolution supposedly promotes amorality . -RRB-<-->N
If we take Bergman at his word , and go by the `` merits of the facts , '' then we will operate on a merit system in science and give every theory its just due -LRB- and no more -RRB- .<-->O
This means creationism would indeed have a place in the science classroom - as a discredited theory on a par with Lamarkianism , or as a minority fringe theory on a par with Velikovsky 's Worlds in Collision .<-->N
That would be honest .<-->O
And while we are on the subject of honesty , it would be wise to appraise creationist textbooks and audio-visual aids on how they live u , p to that virtue .<-->O
Let us begin with the Creation-Science Research Center 's Science and Creation Series .<-->N
Richard M. Lemmon , when reviewing this series for the California State Department of Education -LRB- 1975 -RRB- noted that , `` The discussions of protein accumulation on the prebiotic Earth -LRB- pages 63 to 66 of the ` Handbook for Teachers ' -RRB- is a bad and , I fear , deliberate , distortion of the scientific research of the past two decades . ''<-->O
He also noted : `` The ` Handbook for Teachers , ' page 27 , says that ` genuine science gives no firm evidence that the earth is more than several thousand years old . '<-->N
One hundred years ago that statement may have had some credence among educated mankind .<-->N
Today it is only laughable .<-->N
The world 's libraries are full of books that give overwhelming evidence to the contrary . ''<-->O
His overall conclusion was : `` These books are totally unfit for adoption in our schools .<-->N
Any use of these books in any school will cripple the students ' understanding of science . ''<-->O
- page 21 - The Institute for Creation Research in their audio-visual aid , Creation and Evolution : A Comparison of Two Scientific Models , make a number of statements that scientists in general would regard as false or misleading .<-->O
Here are just a few : `` As a matter of fact , however , neither creation nor evolution is a valid scientific theory ... if the evolution model is a true model , we would expect to discover living things evolving from non-living , inanimate substances ... Creationists maintain that the Second Law of Thermodynamics thus directly contradicts evolution .<-->O
Evolutionists believe , however , that there must be a way out of this apparent dilemma . ''<-->O
Evolutionists are represented as being Lyell-style uniformitarians who believe that `` most geological formations have been caused by present processes ... acting at essentially present rates . ''<-->N
It should be no surprise , then , that many scientists find this audio-visual aid , and most other ICR two-model materials , a gross misrepresentation of the evolutionary position .<-->O
So , if creationists wish to talk about `` fairness , '' something should be said about the fairness of having creationists author the two-model materials without consultation from evolutionists .<-->O
And should n't Hari Krishnas be allowed to author some two-model textbooks , and Day-Age theorists as well ?<-->N
Clearly , it is dishonest to falsely imply that -LRB- 1 -RRB- scientific opinion is equally divided on creation and evolution , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the case is equally good for both models , -LRB- 3 -RRB- there are only two models possible , -LRB- 4 -RRB- the evidence supports creationism , and -LRB- 5 -RRB- evolutionists believe absurdities .<-->O
Yet most creationist school materials make these implications .<-->N
Therefore , one can only conclude that the two-model approach , as now advocated , is not suitable for the public schools .<-->N
A Matter of Courtesy Besides honesty and quality of education , there is such a thing as courtesy .<-->O
Nell Segraves of the Creation-Science Research Center said in an interview , `` Most of the creation science is anti-evolution , showing the flaws in the evolutionary thinking . ''<-->N
This would seem to mean that creationism is mostly polemical attack and denunciation .<-->O
Such has been a common criticism leveled against creationist textbooks , particularly Biology : A Search for Order in Complexity .<-->O
Marvin Moore , a creationist writing in Liberty magazine -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , had this to say about the book : `` The three factors that raise a question about its appropriateness as a textbook in a public school classroom are its defense of Biblical creationism , sometimes with religious language ; its attempt throughout to discredit the evolutionary theory ; and its occasional belittling of scientists who believe in evolution . ''<-->O
- page 22 - Dr. Conrad Bonifazi , Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley , California said , `` The art of teaching itself is brought into disrepute by the introduction into it of denunciatory elements . ''<-->N
-LRB- 1972 . -RRB-<-->N
Since evolution is not taught in that way , why should creationism be ?<-->N
There are , however , non-creationists who would enjoy having the two model approach in the public schools .<-->O
Many of them are atheists and freethinkers who see such two-model teaching as an opportunity to `` debunk religion . ''<-->N
They want to bring back the good old days of the 19th century when orators like Robert Ingersoll criticized religion at large public gatherings and newspapers published the complete text of the speech the next morning .<-->O
They enjoy a good fight , and wish for another Darrow to battle another Bryan in a rousing fracas .<-->O
They feel such opportunities in the public schools will bring about a reduction in the effects of religion on society .<-->O
And there is a basis of validity in this .<-->N
After all , since the Bible is at bottom the basic source of creationist beliefs and the ultimate authority appealed to in every jam , then the Bible can not help but be part of the creation model .<-->O
Therefore , where the Bible makes testable claims , it would be fair in any two-model course to test them .<-->N
Where those claims do n't stand up to the test , religion based on them would be effectively `` debunked . ''<-->O
Is this desirable ?<-->N
A concern over such possible debate in the public schools led Herbert Stern -LRB- 1972 -RRB- of the University of California at San Diego to declare : The teaching of divine creation as a scientific theory demeans religion and I therefore oppose it .<-->O
For most people in this society religion is the highest form of spiritual expression which carries with it perceptions of truth that are unknown to the empirical searches of science .<-->O
To treat a religious vision of -LSB- origins -RSB- on the same footing as a scientific one is to drag religion into a spiritual gutter and to stimulate a fake conflict in the youngster between a system of thinking which has over the centuries sought to cultivate the loftiest of motivations and a system which has sought to bring meaningful order into the immediacies of human experience .<-->O
Any educational program which seeks to make these utterly different human concerns into a single and conflicting search for meaning is one which has declared bankruptcy in its own confidence .<-->O
A scientist who must prove the wisdom of evolution by arguing the absurdity of special creation is as unwelcome to me as the minister who must prove the wisdom of religion by citing the absurdities of science .<-->O
Zoologist Richard D. Alexander -LRB- 1978 -RRB- warned : `` When creation theorists strive to introduce creation into the classroom as an alternative biological theory to evolution they must recognize that they are required to give creation the status of a falsifiable idea that is , an idea that loses any special exemption from scrutiny , that is accepted as conceivably being false , and that must be continually tested until the question is settled .<-->O
A science classroom is not the place for an idea that is revered as holy . ''<-->N
- page 23 - Science Teaching Creationists , however , argue they will only be teaching the `` scientific '' creation model , not the religious one .<-->O
What many fail to remember is that most believers in creationism tie their whole religious value system to that very `` science . ''<-->O
Therefore their religious morals , sense of meaning in life , and many other things will rise or fall with the rise or fall of `` scientific '' creationism .<-->O
If this were not so , if creation `` science '' were not so important to creation religion , the creationists would not be making such vigorous moves in the direction of getting more religious schools to teach it , in addition to the public schools .<-->O
And Dr. Morris would not write statements of the type he does in his Director 's Column in Acts & Facts to wit : `` We do not know what the future may hold .<-->O
Unless the Lord returns first , however , we believe the case for scientific creationism is so sound that , by His grace , we may yet see a real nationwide reintroduction of creationism as a viable alternative into our schools and colleges .<-->O
The ultimate results , in terms of a revival of Biblical Christianity in our national life and in individual lives , are exciting to contemplate . ''<-->O
-LRB- 1974 . -RRB-<-->N
Some freethinkers find it exciting to contemplate too , as an opportunity to create a rise in atheism .<-->O
But Dr. Morris and other creationists are confident that the efforts to Christianize America will win out over the opposition .<-->O
Is this confidence well-placed ?<-->N
Yes , because equal-time teaching of creationism does n't end with just two model textbooks .<-->N
The next step is to demand that at least half the science teachers be creationists in a sort of `` affirmative action '' program for fundamentalism .<-->O
The Creation-Science Report , put out by the Creation Science Research Center , notes that efforts in this direction are already in progress .<-->N
1 , No. 2 -LRB- 1980 -RRB- says , `` Luther Sutherland has been working with the New York Board of Regents to have included questions on the creation model in the Board of Regents exam for teachers .<-->N
This would force a change in teacher training . ''<-->N
Mayer -LRB- 1978 -RRB- knew it all along .<-->N
`` A hidden premise is thus revealed .<-->N
If creationism is to be taught in science classrooms , then teachers must be trained to teach it not in a general or Christian sense , but in a manner acceptable to a small , fundamentalist minority .<-->O
It is not simply the textbooks that creationists strive to control , but teacher training as well . ''<-->N
-LRB- And , one might add , teacher certification . -RRB-<-->N
You see , the end result is the thing the creationists are concerned about , not just the process .<-->O
Morris has indicated in debate and in writing that an atheist or liberal Christian teacher would probably not do justice to the teaching of creationism or the two-model approach .<-->O
His opponents agree , in a way .<-->N
Biologist Richard Haas of Fresno State College -LRB- 1972 -RRB- put it plainly : `` Whatever the merits of creationist points of view such arguments clearly do not belong within the public schools except in courses devoted to theological subjects taught by persons specifically trained in these areas . ''<-->O
- page 24 - In other words , if creationists demand special teachers for creationism , let them be religious teachers , because science teachers are n't qualified to deal with this issue .<-->O
Stimulating Learning Richard Bliss of ICR , however , feels he has research to show that the two-model approach is ideal for science teaching .<-->O
He thinks teachers trained to use it will be better teachers and their students will be better learners .<-->O
He summarized his research in Impact No. 60 in the June , 1978 issue of Acts & Facts .<-->N
Let 's look at the data presented there .<-->N
Using the `` Pre-test , Post-test , Control Group '' design on high school biology students in Racine , Wisconsin , randomly divided into classes by computer , and using teachers all trained in two-model instruction who were equally divided in their preference for either creation or evolution , Bliss began his experiment .<-->O
Normal `` traditional '' material in Biology : Living Systems , by Oram , Hummer , and Smoot , was taught to the control group .<-->N
Origins : Two Models , Evolution / Creation , by Richard Bliss , was involved in the experimental group 's instruction .<-->N
The pre-test prior to the course showed no significant difference between the control and experimental groups .<-->N
Thus both started at basically the same level .<-->N
After the instruction , the post-test results showed a significant gain -LRB- at the .001 level -RRB- by the experimental -LRB- creation/evolution two-model -RRB- group .<-->N
They did better in learning both the evolutionary data and arguments , and those for creationism .<-->O
They had more positive attitudes toward the subject of biology in general .<-->N
Furthermore , `` those students in the experimental group in the middle and high IQ range showed a significant increase in preference toward the creation model after they had examined all the data .<-->O
In other words , they became more creationistic in their point of view and less evolutionary . ''<-->O
And finally , the two-model group `` seemed to develop more critical thinking habits than those who studied origins from an evolutionary model only . ''<-->O
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
It seems , then , that the student virtues inculcated by the Bliss two-model method are higher motivation , better grasp of the data , more ability and inclination to think critically , and more open mindedness , making students `` willing to change their views when new data arrive . ''<-->O
Dr. Jerry Bergman -LRB- 1979 -RRB- praised this study , adding that `` the strongest pedagogical argument for teaching both theories is that it permits comparisons and contrasts .<-->N
Teaching by contrasts helps the student to integrate new knowledge within the total framework of the subject .<-->N
Also , by teaching with an open-ended approach where problems are not solved or ` closed ' and students are left on their own , students are stimulated to continue searching . ''<-->N
- page 25 - To the average person , or school board member , this sounds highly desirable , and may even make it seem `` unconscionable from a pedagogical and scientific point of view , to teach only evolution to students in the public high schools . ''<-->O
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
But is the teaching of evolution alone really that backward ?<-->O
Let 's use some of the critical thinking Bliss praises and take a closer look at his study .<-->O
Bliss had two advantages which make his experiment unfair .<-->N
First , he designed the supposedly fair and balanced two-model teaching .<-->N
Second , his own two-model textbook -LRB- 1976 -RRB- was involved .<-->N
Apparently no evolutionists took part in either the training of the teachers in two-model instruction , or in the writing of the two-model textbook .<-->F
All this was done by Bliss , a creationist at Christian Heritage College .<-->N
Previously , I explained how creationist two-model instructional materials are unfair , imbalanced , and inaccurately portray evolution .<-->O
This is particularly true of Bliss ' two-model textbook used in his experiment .<-->N
It is no wonder , then , that more students became creationists after such a course of study !<-->N
Creationist two-model teacher training is probably no less inferior .<-->N
Richard M. Lemmon 's previously mentioned review of the teacher 's handbooks in the Science and Creation Series published by the Creation-Science Research Center , seems to clearly show this .<-->N
But there is another challenge possible .<-->N
Normal `` traditional '' material in biology , like that used by the control group , generally does n't put as much emphasis on origins as does creationist material .<-->O
This means a student getting a `` traditional '' biology education will know less about origins than one getting a two-model education .<-->O
We are thus forced to ask , is education in origins as all-important as the creationists make it out to be ?<-->N
And , if it is , what would be the results of more concentration on origins in the `` traditional '' curriculum ?<-->N
Surely , in this latter case , the control group would do much better than it did in Bliss ' experiment .<-->O
All the above points indicate that a new study may be necessary .<-->N
But this does not clear the air .<-->N
There is still the thought that a new experiment , of a fairer design , will still show a significant benefit for those learning under the two-model system .<-->O
Would any criticism then be possible ?<-->N
Dr. Bergman is quite correct in his advocacy of teaching by `` comparisons and contrasts . ''<-->O
This is why this has been done in textbooks on many subjects such as history .<-->N
Students get more involved when teachers inspire them to think for themselves rather than just memorize by rote .<-->O
But since when is it necessary to teach pseudo-science side-by-side with legitimate science in order to stimulate thinking ?<-->O
Since when is it necessary to give students the option of believing fallacies and misrepresentations of facts in order to get them to think ?<-->O
There are enough real and genuine controversies in science today without dragging in controversies from the 19th century , such as creationism .<-->O
- page 26 - Though students would certainly benefit from learning why creationism was rejected , there is no point in deceiving them into thinking it is a live scientific controversy today .<-->O
-LRB- It is indeed a live social and religious controversy today , which is why it belongs in comparative sociology or religion classes . -RRB-<-->O
Creationists are constantly citing scientists who challenge various aspects of evolutionary theory in the scientific journals .<-->N
Where these challenges are not outdated , they could be useful instructional tools for aiding students in the better understanding of evolution in particular and biology in general .<-->O
This material would supply the valuable `` comparisons and contrasts . ''<-->O
Controversy is part of science , and a necessary ingredient of its self-correcting operation .<-->N
Students should be made aware of this so they will learn to appreciate the primary virtue of science that creationists seek to obscure : namely , that science is not dogmatic and not a creed laid down in advance of the data .<-->O
Students should also work with the sorts of evidence and reasonings scientists use .<-->N
This will allow them to learn not only the facts , but the method of science .<-->O
Then , and only then , will they be ideally suited to forge new scientific revolutions in the future .<-->O
But to confuse students with generally rejected pseudo-science would not only be a waste of time , it could have harmful effects .<-->O
Students trust their teachers to deal in facts .<-->O
When teachers do not , or combine fact with fallacy in a mixed presentation , students can easily fall for the fallacy .<-->O
This was made clear in Scot Morris ' article `` Believing in ESP : Effects of Dehoaxing '' -LRB- 1980 -RRB- in which he deceived 80 % of the university students in his classes into believing in ESP by giving them a deceptive presentation of `` evidence . ''<-->N
Obviously , if creationism is legitimate science , students should have a fair chance to learn its evidence .<-->O
But if it is as nonsensical as Von Daniken 's `` ancient astronauts '' -LRB- which is not included in history studies that give alternate viewpoints -RRB- , it should be left out .<-->N
The consensus of knowledgeable scientists today , and the science articles published in Creation/Evolution , demonstrate why creationism should be left out .<-->O
Fundamentalist Christian Schools Still , creationists believe truth is on their side .<-->O
That is their right .<-->N
And they can therefore teach creationism as much as they please in the Christian schools .<-->O
But here is where we can test their sincerity .<-->N
Do creationists really believe two-model education is superior from a pedagogical standpoint ?<-->O
Do they really value the teaching of critical thinking ?<-->O
If so , then we would expect them to use only the two-model approach in the Christian schools .<-->N
We would expect them to set an example of `` fairness '' and `` balance '' so at least their students would have the opportunity to have their minds stimulated by this superior teaching method .<-->O
- page 27 - And , of course , Christian Heritage College , a division of which is the Institute for Creation Research , ought to be leading the way in this .<-->O
Dr. Gary Parker , Professor of Biology at Christian Heritage , explained in the Christian Heritage Courier of November 1979 how he teaches biology .<-->N
His article is entitled `` Bios-Logos : Bible-Based Biology '' ; here is part of what he had to say : In our introductory course -LRB- Biology 101 -RRB- , concepts and examples of `` skin in '' and `` skin out '' biology are presented as reflections of God 's power as Creator , Sustainer , Judge , and Redeemer ; and students are challenged to live as responsible stewards and ministers of God 's reconciliation ... Pathological processes -LRB- disease , aging , and death -RRB- are presented in terms of the Fall and our mandate following Christ 's example to bring healing and restoration wherever possible ... In Biosystematics , we contrast the evolutionary concept of species origin with the concept of variation within created kinds , and we try to give students the background and interest to proceed , should the Lord so lead them , with the development of a taxonomic system that will be true both to God 's Word and to God 's world , the twin criteria for true progress in science .<-->O
In other words , Dr. Parker teaches creationism , loading in the religious doctrine of the college , and brings up evolution only to knock it down .<-->N
But maybe this is because these college students have been `` brainwashed '' by evolution in the public schools before they get to the Christian college .<-->N
We need , then , to carefully examine the Creationist attitude toward Christian primary and secondary schools .<-->O
Scientific Creationism , edited by Henry Morris , is frequently sold to Christian secondary schools .<-->N
This is a book that gives only the Creation side of the question .<-->F
Christian schools are encouraged to use it as a central science text , supplemented only by general science material , not by books giving the opposite viewpoint .<-->N
In the September 1979 issue of the Christian Heritage Courier , Dr. Morris criticized the progressive education of John Dewey because it caused `` the concept of education from kindergarten to graduate school '' to be `` reoriented from the teaching of a fixed body of knowledge to the teaching of methods of inquiry to be applied to the continually changing facts of existence . ''<-->O
He noted that this concept of education was not always part of American education .<-->N
`` There was once a time when a search for truth could lead to truth !<-->O
... This meant , of course , that there were absolutes to be discovered , in both science and Scripture , and that man 's duty was to find and teach the truth in both . ''<-->N
Therefore , when progressive education came in , `` human experience and opinion , expressed democratically through the state , became the ultimate arbiter of ` truth . '' '<-->O
- page 28 - The result of all this was a rise in drug addiction and sexual promiscuity , not to mention the confusion and despair of existentialism .<-->O
Therefore : `` Today , the ideal of a wistful search for truth by a community of scholars operating in academic freedom has an air of unreality , to put it mildly , or futility , to put it bluntly . ''<-->O
To Morris , the solution is simple .<-->N
Bring back the Biblical-based education of the past .<-->N
After all , in its proper and primary role , `` education is concerned not with discovery of truth , but the transmission of truth already discovered . ''<-->O
Furthermore , `` true education is responsible under God for the transmission of truth - not the transmission of untruth !<-->O
True education is conservative ... '' -LRB- This last quotation was printed in red in the original . -RRB-<-->N
We ca n't forget , however , that some non-fundamentalist educators challenge aspects of progressive education too .<-->O
They favor more teaching of facts , and a `` back to basics '' approach .<-->O
But this is not all that Christian Heritage creationists are saying .<-->N
Neal Frey of the Department of History and Social Science at the college develops the idea further -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , leaving no doubt on where he stands .<-->O
He writes : Only two types of knowledge exist humanistic knowledge , whose view of being is not Christ-centered and whose center of value is nature or man , and Christian knowledge , whose views of origins and value are Biblical and Christ-centered ... `` Neutral '' knowledge does not exist .<-->O
There are no value-free facts , nor fact-free values : . . .<-->N
There can be no knowledge without values , no education without initiation into some value system .<-->O
From the standpoint of value , all education is moral training .<-->N
The momentous question is not , Shall education inculcate value ?<-->O
but , Shall education inculcate man-centered value or Christian value ?<-->O
... All branches of true knowledge are subdivisions of theology , dealing with various spheres of life under an absolute Trinity ... If students are merely exposed to rival systems of knowledge hence to mutually contradictory assumptions of value without having Christ-centered , Biblical truth rigorously defined , organized , and persistently brought to bear on the subject in question , those students will commonly select from each system the elements which to them seem most plausible , and will amalgamate them into a world view labeled `` Christian . ''<-->O
... Christian education should not insulate students from humanist scholarship .<-->N
It should keep humanism at bay , at arm 's length , while repeatedly and faithfully inculcating intellectually consistent Christ-centered knowledge based on scripture .<-->O
It should not deprive students of a truly Biblical liberal arts education by merely giving the Christian side `` equal time '' with humanism .<-->O
- page 29 - There it is .<-->N
The alleged education benefits of equal-time two-model instruction are not really accepted by creationist educators .<-->N
In fact they are rejected as inferior !<-->O
These further comments by Neal Frey show why .<-->N
Nor will Christian truth triumph in competition with humanist error in the disciplines ... The delusion that Christian truth could so triumph unaided is based on an unscriptural , over-optimistic reading of human nature .<-->O
It ignores original sin , which predisposes man against the truth .<-->O
Man has a vested self-interest in error and in the self-centered organization of knowledge ... Truly `` free thought '' is the liberty to think in Christ-centered terms .<-->O
Thought which has slipped out of militant subservience to Christian truth which has become man-centered is no longer free .<-->O
But in the current intellectual climate , humanist scholarship passes for enlightened free inquiry , while consistently Christian intellectual enterprise is stigmatized as `` biased '' and `` narrow . ''<-->O
Added to this Christian Heritage College seems to have rigid requirements in the hiring of teachers to go along with the above philosophy of education .<-->N
Dr. James J. Veltkamp , professor in Education at Christian Heritage lays it down -LRB- 1979 -RRB- : In the Christian school , college , or university , the instructor does not have the right to teach or publish without supervision .<-->O
-LSB- In red in the original . -RSB-<-->N
And when such supervision is exercised by the authorities appointed and empowered by God , that direction is not inconsistent with true liberty ... Let us not fall into the snare of much secular thinking about academic freedom which insists that there be no standard of faith and character , of doctrine or life , for faculty members ... We must also be alert and resolute to bar from our classrooms all those in the bondage of humanism who question the inerrancy of the Bible , who doubt the literalness and historicity of the first chapters of Genesis ... and who promulgate uniformitarian evolution under the sanctity of the adjective theistic .<-->O
Dr. Veltkamp , a challenger of what he calls `` intellectual libertinism '' minces no words : What right have these instructors to such academic freedom with its tremendous potential for influence ?<-->O
... Who supervises those thinkers and teachers to whom we entrust so much , while , in the name of academic freedom , safeguards are multiplied to free them from supervision ?<-->O
These questions themselves epitomize the monopolistic power of the national liberal-arts religion of secularism , with its mythological quest for the truth .<-->N
-LSB- Emphasis in red in the original . -RSB-<-->N
- page 30 - The illustration with this article includes a communist hammer and sickle under the words `` Academic Freedom . ''<-->N
A profile of Darwin is to the right of it .<-->N
This should leave no doubt that bringing creationism into the public schools is a straightforward effort to eventually remove evolution and bring dogmatism back into education .<-->O
Appeals to more stimulating education through the two-model approach are nothing but pretense .<-->O
Pleas for `` equal time '' are nothing but emotional ploys .<-->N
And the whole thing is just a stop-gap maneuver on the path to a far more radical solution .<-->O
Public Opinion Nonetheless , who can deny the public has strong opinions on this matter ?<-->O
Regardless of the legal , scientific , and educational issues , many people seem to want .<-->O
creationist doctrines taught in public school science classes .<-->N
Do n't their voices count for something ?<-->F
That these voices may be in a majority is indicated by a few polls which have been taken .<-->F
For example , in 1973 , a random survey was made of 1,346 homes in the Del Norte County Unified School District in California .<-->F
Residents were asked the question , `` Should evolution be taught in the public schools ? ''<-->N
The results were 58 % answering yes , 34 % answering no , and 8 % undecided .<-->N
When these same people were then asked , `` Should creation be taught in the public schools ? ''<-->N
89 % said yes , 8 % said no , and 3 % were undecided .<-->N
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
In the same year , creationists surveyed 1,995 homes in Cupertino , California and found that 44.3 % believed in creation , 23.3 % believed in evolution , 3.5 % believed in both , 10.6 % believed in neither , and 18.3 % were undecided .<-->F
When asked the question , `` Should scientific evidence for creation be presented along with evolution ? ''<-->N
84.3 % of these people said yes , 7.8 % said no , 6.3 % were uncertain , and 1.6 % said neither .<-->N
-LRB- Bliss , 1978 ; Weinberg , 1978 . -RRB-<-->N
The Midwest Center of the Institute for Creation Research conducted a random telephone survey asking , `` Should evolution only , creation only , both evolution and creation or neither evolution or creation be taught in the public schools ? ''<-->F
The predictable answers came : 5.2 % saying evolution only , 18.9 % creation only , 64 % both creation and evolution , and 11 % neither .<-->N
Bliss -LRB- 1978 -RRB- concluded , `` While these data are limited , they nevertheless provide a good sampling of what adults feel is fair and proper for public schools . ''<-->O
Weinberg -LRB- 1978 -RRB- added in his article , `` Yet if these very limited investigations reflect anything like the actual situation as I believe they do then their results are a tribute to the poor job we have done in teaching evolution . ''<-->O
University students , as well as the public , seem to share this approval of two-model education in origins .<-->O
This was brought out in a paper published in Origins in 1979 by Jerry Bergman .<-->N
In reviewing the literature , Bergman noted the Christensen and Cannon survey of Brigham Young University students in the years 1935 and 1973 .<-->F
- page 31 - When given the statement , `` Man 's creation did not involve biological evolution '' in 1935 , 36 % of the students agreed .<-->F
But in 1973 , that figure jumped to 81 % .<-->N
When given the statement , `` The world 's creation did not take millions of years , '' the 1935 students gave only a 5 % favorable response while the 1973 students gave a 27 % favorable response .<-->O
Over 1000 students were used in each sampling .<-->N
Bergman also noted John C. Troost 's 1966 survey of secondary school biology teachers in Indiana .<-->N
This study `` showed that 173 out of 325 felt that evolution was a theory and not a fact , and 163 out of 330 thought that evolution should be presented as one of several alternative theories . ''<-->O
Bergman 's own study was conducted at Bowling Green State University in Ohio .<-->N
His subjects were 442 undergraduates in teacher-training programs and 74 graduate students taking courses in the area of biology .<-->N
The results were that 91 % of the undergraduate and 71.8 % of the graduate students felt that both models should be taught in the schools .<-->N
Bergman admits , however , that Bowling Green is a `` conservative '' school and that only 5 out of his total sampling of 516 were biology majors .<-->N
Yet , in spite of this , he maintained he was testing the `` assumption '' that `` the vast majority of teachers would opt for teaching only evolution '' and that his study helped demonstrate how `` a clear majority of both parents and teachers are in favor of the two-model approach to origins . ''<-->O
This conclusion was then used by him to question the opposition given to two-model teaching of origins in professional journals such as the American Biology Teacher .<-->N
Perhaps a survey of biology teachers , who are more knowledgeable in this area of science , should be taken to answer him .<-->N
But regardless of the shortcomings of these various surveys , the question remains , how are we to regard this public outcry concerning the scientific teaching of origins ?<-->O
One thing to be realized is that this outcry is part of an overall dissatisfaction with the public schools , and creationists have been effectively playing on that dissatisfaction .<-->O
It also comes at a time when considerable public pressure is being brought to bear against `` objectionable '' textbooks .<-->O
Mel and Norma Gabler in Texas challenge textbook selections every year .<-->N
TV evangelist Jerry Falwell feels that America is in a moral crisis .<-->O
`` For our nation this is a life-and-death struggle , and the battle line for this struggle is the textbooks . ''<-->O
-LRB- Park , 1980 . -RRB-<-->N
As a result , Judith Krug of the American Library Association notes that 300 reports of book-banning or censorship were received by that organization in 1979 , a number greater than at any other time in at least 25 years .<-->N
One example was the Anaheim , California school board which , under pressure , weeded out most of the works of William Shakespeare , Charles Dickens , and Mark Twain in the city schools .<-->N
- page 32 - The people have power , and can have whatever type of education they choose to vote for .<-->N
So the only response that can be given is that the public seems poorly informed on scientific matters , has not explored all the problems and ramifications of two-model teaching of origins gone into in this article , and is presently taking steps that seriously infringe on the constitutional protection of minorities from majority -LRB- or supposed majority -RRB- religious views .<-->O
It is not wrong to forthrightly declare the public is in error .<-->N
They have been wrong before .<-->N
Nor is it wrong to protect the integrity of science and science teaching from those who would impose public rule over matters of fact and evidence .<-->O
Creationists , however , do n't seem to respect science in this way .<-->O
Ariel A. Roth , editor of Origins , put out by the creationist Geoscience Research Institute at the Seventh Day Adventist College , Loma Linda University , had this to say in Liberty magazine -LRB- 1978 -RRB- .<-->N
`` Part of the problem is that evolutionists believe themselves to be the authority regarding the question of origins .<-->N
They hold that contents of textbooks and curriculum should not be left up to the public or legislative bodies , but to those with ` qualified professional judgment . '' '<-->O
He is promoting democracy here , but in a most anti-intellectual manner .<-->N
Carried to its logical conclusion , this would mean that if the public wants education , they should teach themselves , since Roth thinks they know what they want to be told , and hence must know what is true .<-->O
In view , then , of the public 's possible favoring of the two-model idea in education , is it right to say they should have it if they want it ?<-->O
It is more correct to say they will have it if they want it .<-->O
It is their choice .<-->N
And the only task remaining for scientists is to start educating the electorate before the people cut their own educational throats .<-->N
There is a freedom issue at stake here , too .<-->O
The two-model approach , with its obvious religious overtones , wo n't only bring religious issues into the science classroom , but possibly religious controversy .<-->O
Science teachers will , regardless of which side they are on , find it hard to keep their own religious views private .<-->O
Therefore , they will become marked men and women in the community if they are a minority .<-->N
Children will find themselves exposing their private beliefs during class discussions .<-->N
Creationists may or may not want it this way , but , in actual practice , that is what will most likely happen .<-->O
We must therefore ask the public if they support such invasion of privacy .<-->O
That the public might not really want two-model education is still a possibility .<-->O
At least some students are expressing their dissatisfaction with creationism being forced on them , and this is a good sign .<-->O
For example , when Nancy Leman , a junior college student at Palomar College in San Marcos , California , protested an evolutionary reference in her sociology book , a fellow student , Doreen Rabb , wrote the following letter to the San Diego Union shortly after the August , 1979 incident .<-->N
- page 33 - I and 40 other students had to sit through Nancy Leman 's constant interruptions as she tried to force her Christian 's view of life on the class .<-->N
I resent the lost class time spent trying to satisfy Ms. Leman 's uncalled-for comments .<-->O
Ms. Leman simply does not understand that the entire world is not Christian , and does not want to have religion thrown at them .<-->O
When I registered for sociology this summer , I was registering for a science class , not a religion class .<-->N
Perhaps if more students challenged creationism in this way , or lobbied for adequate education in the disciplines , the public might gain a better understanding of what is at stake .<-->O
Conclusion The American people are somewhat unique in the fervency with which they so often adhere to fundamentalist Protestant beliefs .<-->O
But this is a fact that can not be denied , and should not be left out of public education .<-->N
Material about the nature of various American , and perhaps world , religious beliefs ought to be presented to students .<-->O
Qualified instructors in this area should be sought .<-->N
It must be understood , however , that biology teachers are not so qualified , and the science curriculum is the wrong category in which to place religious , or religious based , material .<-->O
The Constitution makes a distinction between sacred and secular , and so should the public schools .<-->O
The public , of course , can have the matter any way they like it , but they should be aware of what each approach to education implies , and what some of the problems will be if one particular minority scientific or religious theory is brought into the science classroom .<-->O
They should try to understand that mixing religion with science confuses students about the nature of both .<-->O
They should be informed that there is no major controversy between scientists on creation and evolution , but that the controversy is mostly between scientists and nonscientists .<-->O
And they should realize that if creation is to be given equal time with evolution , astrology should be given equal time with astronomy ; astrology 's following being equal to that of creationism , and the theory being equally outdated .<-->O
Though education should promote critical thinking , it should do so in an overall context of passing on factual information .<-->O
Critical thinking is a tool , not the whole ball of educational wax .<-->N
A debating society is not a school , and mere exposure to variant opinions is not education .<-->O
The practical necessity of seeing to it that students are adequately prepared for possible careers in science should not be overlooked .<-->O
The teaching of pseudo-science as science does not further this aim .<-->N
- page 34 - If creationism were just another pseudo-science , however , there would n't be the pressure to have it taught .<-->O
Creationism has such force only because it is a religious theory , or is supportive of one .<-->O
People , therefore , have a larger emotional stake in seeing to it that it is included .<-->O
But this guarantees religious strife since there are so many creation theories , not to mention so many non-creation theories , related to origins .<-->O
Furthermore , there are various religious alternatives on history , geography , and most other courses of study .<-->N
To bring creationism in , then , would open up an explosive can-of-worms that would quickly endanger the constitutional guarantee of church-state separation .<-->O
It would also rob the educational system of valuable class time that should be devoted to imparting the knowledge of our day .<-->O
Creationists argue , however , that two-model education stimulates students .<-->N
No doubt it does , but religious pseudo-science is not the only possible educational stimulant .<-->O
Real controversies in science are far more preferable in this age of rapid scientific progress .<-->O
Furthermore , creationists do n't seem sincere about the educational advantages of two-model learning .<-->O
They do n't use it in their Christian parochial schools , and in fact claim it is inferior .<-->O
-LRB- An evaluation team from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges felt that Christian Heritage College practiced `` indoctrination '' not education , and that this would militate against accreditation of the college . -RRB-<-->O
Furthermore , ICR creationists successfully saw to it that a course at Iowa State University in `` critical judgement '' was terminated because it dealt critically with creationism -LRB- Zuidema , 1980 -RRB- .<-->O
Though creationists participate in a two-model course offered by Drs. Awbrey and Thwaites at San Diego State University , they have not promoted this in a manner consistent with their espousal of two-model education perhaps because instructors on the evolution side are also included , instructors who are competent at critiquing creationist beliefs .<-->O
Creationists want to write the textbooks and certify the teachers .<-->N
And though they push their creationist-controlled two-model teaching in all tax supported schools , colleges included , and demand equal time for creationism in all tax-supported institutions , such as the Smithsonian , their main emphasis is on the public secondary and primary schools .<-->O
This is because , there , creationists can more easily involve parents and play on religious sentiments .<-->N
School boards are far more accessible to public outcry because they are directly elected .<-->N
College boards of regents are often appointed .<-->N
Legislation affecting public schools is also easier to obtain than legislation affecting colleges or museums .<-->N
Public pressure is what the creationist movement is about , which is why creationists put such emphasis on public opinion polls that favor two-model teaching .<-->O
But scientific evidence is not determined by majority vote , a fact creationists hope the public will forget .<-->O
- page 35 - The promotion of two-model teaching in science by creationists then , seems only to be a way of getting Christian fundamentalist doctrines into the public schools to neutralize the effects that evolution teaching might be having on the spread of such fundamentalist beliefs .<-->O
It is also to `` win more souls for Christ . ''<-->N
Appeals to `` fairness '' and `` equal time '' are simply emotional ploys , and two-model textbooks are simply maneuvers .<-->O
The final aim is a triumphant creationism .<-->N
For one to espouse two-model teaching in science , one must ignore or be unaware of the educational havoc it will cause , the social problems , the legal complications , the effect on the quality of science , the effect on religious liberty , and the effect on academic freedom .<-->O
To still espouse such a view after all these facts are made clear requires a myopic narrowness of view and an incredible singleness of purpose unique to the business of professional religious pseudoscience .<-->O

---------------- 8Forum : Should Creationism Be Taught in Public Schools ?<-->F
Kerwin Thiessen Several years ago the Wichita Eagle-Beacon carried a story which reported the Flat Earth Society to be alive and well in modern America .<-->N
This select group of traditionalists have held tenaciously to the archaic notion that the earth is flat , not spherical .<-->O
Such a society reminds one of the self-proclaimed scientist who said , Don t confuse me with the facts .<-->O
My mind is made up !<-->N
In the most recent court battle concerning this issue , U.S. District Judge William Overton struck down Arkansas Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act by rejecting two state arguments that are crucial elements in this debate : 1 -RRB- that evolution is as religious as creationism , and 2 -RRB- that public schools should teach what the public wants .<-->O
In striking down the Arkansas law requiring schools to give a balanced presentation of both evolution and creationism Judge Overton stated , No group , no matter how large or small , may use the organs of movement , of which the public schools are the most conspicuous and influential , to foist its religious beliefs on others .<-->O
What about the question , Is evolution just as religious as creationism ?<-->N
My answer is , yes , because the system of evolution is , in its definition , a belief system .<-->O
Sir Julian Huxley , one of today s most respected evolutionists has defined evolution as a directional and essentially irreversible process occurring in time , which in its course gives rise to an increase of variety and an increasingly high level of organization in its products .<-->O
Our present knowledge indeed forces us to the view that the whole of reality is evolution a single process of self-transformation -LRB- What Is Science ?<-->O
p. 272 -RRB- .<-->N
I refer to such a definition because there is not a shred of scientific evidence to scientifically demonstrate Huxley s statement .<-->N
The definition of science shows that something is scientific only if it can be observed -LCB- 25 -RCB- and verified .<-->N
All must admit that it is impossible to prove scientifically any particular concept of origins , creationism or evolution .<-->O
No human being was there in the beginning to observe and verify how matter and life came into existence .<-->N
For nearly one hundred years evolution-as-a-dogma has been accepted and perpetuated in America s public educational institutions , and the proof of such a statement is seen in the almost universal acceptance of three sub-beliefs : 1 -RRB- faith in spontaneous generation of life substance , 2 -RRB- faith in transitional forms between different kinds of organisms , -LRB- unverifiable on the basis of anatomy , embryology , blood and protein analyses , fossils , or genetics -RRB- and 3 -RRB- faith in mutations as a source of raw materials by which supposed evolutionary changes in organisms might have come about in the past .<-->O
Each of these three sub-beliefs is dependent upon the other , as well as the very definition of evolution as given by Huxley .<-->O
And each of these statements is made without experimentally verifiable or observable scientific evidence .<-->N
The point is that both evolution and creationism are belief systems .<-->N
Both are embraced through believing what is unobservable rather than on the basis of what is scientifically provable .<-->N
I disagree with Judge Overton in striking down the Arkansas law on this basis .<-->O
He has closed his mind to the true definitions of science and religion .<-->N
Science deals with observable data .<-->N
Religion deals with belief and faith in the unobservable .<-->O
What about the matter of public education , i.e. , Should the public schools teach what the public wants ?<-->N
The First Amendment of the United States Constitution , Section One , states , Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .<-->O
Clearly the intent of our forefathers was that freedom prevail in all areas of civil life , education included .<-->O
Neither creationism nor evolution should be barred from the classroom where citizens of the republic desire that they be taught .<-->N
Should not public education be nonpartisan ?<-->N
Some students and their parents will place their faith in the belief-system of evolution when it comes to the study of origins .<-->O
Others will embrace creationism .<-->O
Both should be presented in the classroom where both are desired by the public .<-->N
The role of today s educator should permit such an approach .<-->N
The teacher used to be seen as a disseminator of knowledge , imparting to eager students the information and concepts they should know .<-->O
Today s teacher , however , is taught to be skilled in questioning techniques , -LCB- 26 -RCB- particularly in the disciplines of science and social science instruction .<-->O
This inquiry approach puts priority upon a presentation of data by the teacher coupled with thorough reading and experimentation by the student .<-->N
Such an approach is intended to be objective with the result of developing logical thought and decision-making skills among the students rather than reflecting the pre-conceived bias of the teacher .<-->O
Such skills as observation , classification , inferring , predicting , measuring , communicating , interpreting , formulating questions and hypothesis , experimentation , and formulating models , teach students to make critical observations when dealing with data .<-->N
It makes First Amendment sense to present students with all available data in their search for truth in any given area of study .<-->N
Especially in a free society , students must be allowed the academic freedom to pursue every viewpoint possible .<-->O
The most valid conclusion is always the one that best reflects all available data .<-->O
One certainly can not label our public schools as free-learning-centers when a most crucial area of study , i.e. , origins , is oppressed by state and federal legislation permitting only one viewpoint .<-->N
My answer to the question , Should creationism be taught in public schools ?<-->N
, is , therefore , Yes !<-->N
It should be allowed to be taught in those local school districts where students and parents embrace creationism and desire that it be taught by knowledgeable instructors .<-->O
My specific rationale for answering in this way is as follows : 1 .<-->N
The constituents of each local school district should determine the parameters of educational instruction for that district and that district only .<-->N
Since neither evolution nor creation is accessible to the scientific method , since they deal with origins , not presently observable events , both should be formulated as scientific models , or frameworks , within which the student can then predict and correlate observed facts .<-->O
Such scientific models can neither be proven nor tested , only compared .<-->N
Which model can explain , with the least amount of difficulty , the observable data in the real world ?<-->O
Evolution is a faith-system .<-->F
Creation is also a faith-system .<-->N
Both of these systems have far-reaching implications for the life , world-view , and morality of the adherent .<-->O
Both systems should be discussed in their entirety and presented as viable options .<-->N
Therefore , each is as religious as the other .<-->N
Each is as scientific as the other , as well .<-->F
Neither evolution nor creationism should be the only view presented in the public classroom if both views are desired by parents and students .<-->O
Henry Morris of Institute for Creation Research has -LCB- 27 -RCB- stated , and I agree , There are ... strong scientific and pedagogical reasons why both models should be taught , as objectively as possible , in public classrooms , giving arguments pro and con for each .<-->O
Some students and their parents believe in creation , some in evolution , and some are undecided .<-->N
If creationists desire only the creation model to be taught , they should send their children to private schools which do this ; if evolutionists want only evolution to be taught , they should provide private schools for that purpose .<-->O
The public schools should be neutral and either teach both or teach neither -LRB- ICR Impact , Vol .<-->N

You Ca n't Educate People Into Believing in Evolution If , as a great philosopher once said , `` life 's a bitch and then you die , '' what 's the point of debating about the existence of evolution ?<-->O
According to a new report by Calvin College assistant professor Jonathan Hill , many Americans do not think it 's that important to have the `` correct beliefs '' on the origins of human life .<-->O
His research was funded by the BioLogos Foundation , a pro-evolution , Christian organization founded by National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins .<-->N
`` It s important to know that a large portion of the population is unsure about their beliefs , and there is a large portion of the population that doesn t care , '' Hill said in an interview .<-->O
In a nationally representative survey of more than 3000 people , Hill divided respondents in the survey into `` creationists , '' `` atheistic evolutionists , '' `` theistic evolutionists , '' and `` unsure , '' but even creating four categories is tricky .<-->O
Under his definition , all `` creationists believe that God created humans as part of a single , miraculous act , '' but some think that happened within the last 10,000 years -LRB- often called `` young-earth creationists , '' -RRB- .<-->O
Others believe the earth has been around much longer -LRB- `` old-earth creationists '' -RRB- .<-->N
That group accounts for about 37 percent of the population ; another 16 percent accept the scientific evidence for evolution while still believing God was involved in creation in some way -LRB- or `` theistic evolutionists '' -RRB- ; 9 percent embrace evolution and reject God -LRB- or `` atheistic evolutionists '' -RRB- .<-->O
This leaves 39 percent who are unsure , or whose views do n't fit into the categories typically used to frame this issue .<-->O
And that matters .<-->N
For a long time , Gallup 's survey on evolution and creationism has been the standard for opinion data on this topic ; the organization 's 2014 `` Beliefs and Values '' survey suggested that 42 percent of Americans are creationists , 31 percent are theistic evolutionists , and 19 percent are atheistic evolutionists .<-->O
In his report , Hill argued that Gallup 's numbers are wildly misleading .<-->N
`` The difference between Gallup and -LSB- this survey -RSB- is almost certainly due to Gallup respondents being forced to choose from limited options , even when many are unsure of what they believe or maintain beliefs that do not fit into the options available , '' he wrote .<-->O
Plus , a lot of people just do n't care that much .<-->O
Hill found that 58 percent of respondents said this topic is only `` somewhat , not very , or not at all important '' to them .<-->N
People who held creationist views were the most emphatic about their beliefs ; 64 percent of that group said they care about being `` right , '' presumably in the metaphysical sense of rightness .<-->O
But that still means roughly a third of that group does n't care that much about cosmic correctness ; and among people with other views on evolution and creation , the apathy was much stronger .<-->O
Percentage of People Who Feel It 's Important to Be `` Right '' About the Origins of Human Life Even if people do n't personally care about being right , they do seem to care a lot about what 's taught in science classrooms , particularly in public schools .<-->O
Since the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision in the 1987 case Edwards v. Aguillard , there has been somewhat less controversy over teachers teaching creationism , said Josh Rosenau , the programs and policy director at the National Center for Science Education .<-->N
In that case , the justices ruled that `` the First Amendment doesn t allow schools to present one particular view over another .<-->O
If you explicitly talk about creationism , then someone can come after you , '' he said .<-->N
`` But there s a longstanding aspect of creationist rhetoric that is a two-model view of the world . ''<-->N
Teachers might present creationism and evolution as different explanations for the diversity of life on earth , for example , along with arguments for and against both ways of thinking .<-->O
`` If you weaken one -LSB- side -RSB- , it 's ipso facto an argument for the other , '' Rosenau said .<-->N
Even with the legal restrictions placed on teaching creationism in the classroom , many teachers still mention it in their lessons : A 2011 survey by Penn State professors Michael Berkman and Eric Plutzer found that 13 percent of high-school biology teachers across the country spend at least an hour on creationism each school year , while another 5 percent endorse it in passing .<-->O
An estimated 28 percent teach evolutionary biology according to the recommendations of the National Research Council ; the rest do n't advocate either view , '' -LSB- disassociating -RSB- themselves from the very material they 're expected to teach . ''<-->O
Often , this is because teachers want to avoid `` controversy , '' the authors write .<-->O
But all the anxiety around the origins of human life may partially be a matter of framing , Rosenau said .<-->N
`` No creationist wakes up in the morning and says , ' I have really strong opinions about whether Archaeopteryx is the ancestor of modern birds , ' '' he said .<-->O
* `` Who are we as people ?<-->N
That s the question that they think evolution is answering .<-->N
What does it mean to be a person ?<-->N
What does it mean to be an animal ? ''<-->N
In other words , the cliche of pitting science against religion is a category error , to a certain extent : Evolutionary biology provides certain insights into the mechanisms of how human life has formed and changed over time , but it ca n't provide insight into the meaning behind those changes .<-->O
Yet the meaning part is often what matters in vitriolic `` debates '' about the origins of life .<-->N
`` No creationist wakes up in the morning and says , ' I have really strong opinions about whether Archaeopteryx is the ancestor of modern birds . ' ''<-->O
The psychological need to see purpose , that is really interesting , '' said Jeffrey Hardin , a professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin , at the Faith Angle Forum in Miami on Tuesday .<-->O
Many Christians consider Neo-Darwinian theory to be dysteleological , or lacking in purpose . ''<-->O
Hardin is himself an evangelical Christian ; he often speaks with church communities about evolution in his work with the BioLogos Foundation .<-->N
In these conversations , he said , many evangelicals point to statements like that of paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson , who wrote in his 1967 book , The Meaning of Evolution , `` Man is the result of a purposeless and materialistic process that did not have him in mind .<-->O
He was not planned . ''<-->N
When this is echoed by outspoken atheists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris , Hardin said , `` Evangelicals look at it and go , I can t accept that , and therefore I can not accept thinking at all about evolutionary biology . ' ''<-->O
But ultimately , this may be what matters most for influencing Americans ' opinions on the origins of life .<-->O
In his report , Hill found that religious belief was the strongest determinant of people 's views on evolution much more so than education , socioeconomic status , age , political views , or region of the country .<-->O
More importantly , being part of a community where people had stated opinions on evolution or creation , like a church , had a big impact on people 's views .<-->O
`` Creationists are substantially more likely to belong to networks who agree with them about human origins , '' he wrote .<-->O
`` Likewise , creationists are more likely to belong to congregations who have settled positions that reject human evolution . ''<-->N
What that means is that `` debates '' about evolution and creationism actually might not be that effective .<-->O
`` For those invested in the position that human evolution is compatible with orthodox Christian faith , the findings from -LSB- this survey -RSB- tell us that persuasion needs to move beyond a purely intellectual level , '' Hill wrote .<-->O
`` Ideas are important , but ideas only persuade when individuals are in a social position that allows them to seriously consider what is before them . ''<-->O
For those who value the widespread acceptance of evolution , this is an important insight : There may be more effective ways to persuade people to consider principles of biology without trying to debunk the existence of God .<-->O
`` This is the century of biology , and evolution is the foundation of biology , '' Rosenau said .<-->N
`` Being open to those conversations is really important for scientists . ''<-->O
As for those who are concerned with being cosmically correct , like the hardcore creationists or the Richard Dawkinses of the world , there may not be many options available by way of persuasion .<-->O
Classroom discussions are n't the most important factor in shaping people 's views , and many people are either unsure or do n't care about being right .<-->O
It seems that most people simply believe what they 're going to believe about the metaphysical nature of the universe .<-->O

Should Creationism Be Taught in the Public Schools ?<-->N

We need to see this reasoning before we can evaluate the justice of the proposal from a Rawlsian perspective .12 Perhaps he thinks that it would go something like this : One knows that people are likely to disagree about comprehensive beliefs such as those profound religious beliefs about God and God s methods of Creation , but under the veil of ignorance one does not know what one s own view will be on such matters or whether , say , one would be in a position see to it that only those beliefs were taught in the schools .<-->O
Plantinga must think that under such conditions rational persons would agree to institute -LRB- BR -RRB- as a defensive safeguard since no one could be sure that their own preferred view would be taught , they all would want at least the right to see to it that another view that opposes it not be taught either .<-->O
In other words , I supposedly would reason as follows : since I might be a creationist whose epistemology tells me that true knowledge comes only from the Bible and that evolution is contrary to God s Truth , I would want the right to exclude evolution from the schools to protect my children from what I would take to be its evil influence .<-->O
But this reasoning is surely mistaken .<-->O
Rational agents would never agree to such a gag rule as a basic right for a variety of reasons .<-->O
First , to do so would be to gut the curriculum , for even the most well-established facts may threaten some element of some person s comprehensive beliefs .<-->O
As we saw , creationists comprehensive beliefs put them at odds with not just the facts of 12 According to John Rawls influential view , justice in a pluralistic democracy is a function of fairness , with fairness understood in terms of fair procedures .<-->O
-LRB- Rawls 1971 -RRB- The Original Position is an abstraction of such a procedure in which we are to imagine ourselves as rational persons who are contracting to form what will be the basic social institutions , while under a veil of ignorance that prevents our knowing in advance what position we will hold in that society once it is constituted .<-->O

March 2002 -RRB- evolutionary biology , but also with the findings of most other sciences .<-->N
Furthermore , because of the interconnections among scientific theories , opposition to what might appear to be just a single finding , necessarily involves opposition to many other ones as well .<-->O
Nor are creationists the only ones that would make use of -LRB- BR -RRB- ; there are thousands of special interests groups that would use such a right to prohibit the teaching of specific facts or even whole subjects they objected to .<-->O
One does not have to look far to find parents who would object to teaching about racial equality , the facts of reproductive health , or that even that the earth is round .13 Only the utterly trivial could have a chance of escaping the gag of -LRB- BR -RRB- .<-->O
No rational person would agree to such a policy .<-->O
Plantinga tries to avoid this conclusion by suggesting that we could teach things hypothetically .<-->N
That is , while we could teach no account of creation as fact , we could teach them all conditional upon their specific epistemic base -LRB- EB -RRB- .<-->O
On this proposal , presumably a teacher would have to include a list of hypotheticals , along the lines that If one starts with EB-YEC then God created the world and human beings 10,000 years old ; If one starts with EB-Ra l , then extra-terrestrials created human beings by genetic engineering hundreds of thousands of years ago and so on .<-->O
But this has similar problems .<-->N
Though more people might accept this kind of hypothetical teaching , no doubt there would remain a significant number who would still object to having their children exposed to such ideas even hypothetically .<-->O
On the other hand , even if we supposed that no parent would exert BR , rational agents would still reject the proposal in that it would 13 On biblical authority , schools in Zion , Illinois around the time of the Scopes trial not only rejected evolution , but also Modern Astronomy and its infidel theories of a moving , round earth .<-->O

March 2002 -RRB- have the complementary problem rather than gut the curriculum , it would balloon it to absurd proportions in that teachers would have to present a huge series of antecedent comprehensive beliefs -LRB- potentially every parents specific EB -RRB- , followed by the relevant consequents for each , again for all but the most trivial issue .<-->O
Second , under the veil of ignorance one should not limit one s deliberations to the scenario in which one was a parent with a comprehensive belief that he or she did not want challenged .<-->O
The rational person would also have to think about being a child growing up in the household of such a parent .<-->O
Sadly , we all know parents who are bigots or ideologues and others who are simply narrow-minded or ignorant .<-->O
A good education may be a child s only window to a clear picture of the world and to an open future .<-->O
To agree to -LRB- BR -RRB- would be to close that window .<-->O
This would be a serious harm for the children of such parents .<-->O
It would harm other children as well , all of whom could be deprived of a decent education , because the public schools could be forced to omit even basic scientific facts , simply because some parent found them offensive to his or her private religious beliefs .<-->O
Indeed , it is difficult to think of any substantive fact that could pass unchallenged , if we grant with Plantinga that each person may appeal to -LRB- BR -RRB- from the warrant of her personal epistemic base -LRB- EBP -RRB- .<-->O
Judging the question after considering the points of view of both parents and children , rational persons in Rawls Original Position would reject -LRB- BR -RRB- .<-->O
Thus , a school policy that ignores -LRB- BR -RRB- is not unjust , for -LRB- BR -RRB- itself is unjust .<-->O
So , what would rational agents agree to ?<-->O
They would assent , I believe , to something very similar to our current system , along the lines I mentioned above a separation of the public and the private .<-->O
They would require that public institutions , like the public schools , not teach views based upon private epistemologies such as special revelation , because one can not rationally adjudicate among beliefs that different persons purport to know simply as a Christian or a Hindu , a Ra lian , a Pagan , or whatever .<-->O
Rational agents would agree to a basic right to hold such beliefs privately , but as a R. T. Pennock Should Creationism Be Taught . ?<-->O

March 2002 -RRB- defensive measure , would not want the government to support beliefs of this sort even conditionally , as in Plantinga s proposal , since it would be impossible for schools to teach the myriad of private views without favoring some over others .<-->O
Instead they would require that public institutions be constrained to public knowledge .<-->N
In teaching about the empirical world , this means that the schools should limit their science curriculum to scientific findings testable conclusions that we can rationally draw on the basis of observational evidence and the methodological assumption of natural law .<-->O
Although for such reasons I am afraid we can not stomach the main entr e that Plantinga offers , perhaps we may still at least break bread together in another way .<-->O
While we can not agree that we should teach creationism even conditionally , we can agree that we should not teach science -LRB- including evolutionary theory -RRB- dogmatically .<-->O
Scientific truths are never more than approximate , and always come attached with some greater or lesser degree of likelihood that depends upon their evidential support .<-->O
While it may be reasonable to teach well-confirmed findings as sober truths , scientists must always remain cognizant that even these might have to be revised should new evidence appear that undermines their support ; even settled truths may not legitimately be put forward as being absolute .<-->O
The good science teacher will point this out .<-->O
This is not the same as teaching science conditionally , as though its epistemic base were no better or worse than any private epistemology ; rather it is just a straightforward acknowledgment of some features of its methodology .<-->O
Knowing the rational limits of science , the rational person would agree not to have it portrayed as something it is not .<-->O
It is not a religion and should not be taught as one .<-->N
Its findings are trustworthy , but they are not dogma .14 Teaching science simply as a set of facts to be memorized can make it seem like a catechism , but teach science properly , by also teaching its methods of investigation , and dogmatism will 14 See -LRB- Siegel 1984 , pp. 359-362 -RRB- for a rebuttal of the creationist claim that teaching evolution amounts to indoctrination .<-->O

Creationists and others who hold to some private epistemology may still teach in their homes and churches that man does not live by bread alone , but surely the reasonable and just compromise is to agree that in the public schools we should content ourselves with sharing science s simple , basic fare .<-->O
THE ANSWER In reviewing the arguments , we find many good reasons for excluding creationism from the schools , and few good reasons for not doing so .<-->O
On balance , it seems clear that the wiser course is not to allow the conflict into the classroom .<-->O

1.6 things you should understand about stay-at-home moms During a speech in Rhode Island last week , President Barack Obama made a statement some interpreted to mean he did n't want women to choose to be stay-at-home mothers , according to Lois Collins of Deseret News National .<-->O
`` Sometimes , someone usually mom leaves the workplace to stay home with the kid , which then leaves her earning a lower wage for the rest of her life as a result .<-->N
And that 's not a choice we want Americans to make , '' Obama said Friday in his speech .<-->N
But do n't worry , stay-at-home moms aren t going anywhere , despite the debate over Obama 's statements .<-->O
According to the Pew Research Center , 29 percent of mothers don t work outside the home , which is up from 23 percent in 1999 .<-->N
And some stay-at-home wives have been commended for helping America become what it is today .<-->N
According to The American Enterprise Institute s Charles Murray , they promote social goods that help build communities and neighborhoods , like attending PTA meetings , promoting youth sports and ensuring the neighborhood is safe by keeping an eye on each other s houses when no one is home .<-->O
Murray said working women often provide positivity and goodness , too , and they often get a lot of the praise since they re balancing work and home lives .<-->O
But stay-at-home wives , specifically , should be acclaimed for their continued efforts to keep their communities safe .<-->O
I just want us to realize that stay-at-home wives are one of the resources that have made America America , Murray wrote .<-->O
It is entirely understandable that some wives work full time , either for the fulfillment of a vocation or to make money the same reasons men work full time .<-->O
But when either partner in a marriage and it will usually be the wife chooses to devote full time to being a parent and neighbor instead , that choice should not just be accepted , but celebrated .<-->O
While stay-at-home moms help the community , what else are they doing in today s society to help their children and their families ?<-->O
Here are six things you should understand about stay-at-home moms .<-->N
Stay-at-home moms shape their children into who they are .<-->N
According to Focus on the Family s Jill Savage , stay-at-home mothers create a stable home , where they teach their children to understand who they re going to be in the future and what it is they value .<-->O
Raising a good child begins in the home , and it s the stay-at-home moms who create the environment in that home , Savage wrote .<-->N
Home is where a child learns who they are , Savage wrote .<-->F
Each of us is created uniquely by God .<-->F
We have unique gifts , talents and temperaments .<-->N
Home is the place those are discovered and celebrated .<-->N
Stay-at-home moms are better off financially .<-->N
Stay-at-home moms are well-educated and have the potential to work outside the home , but would rather raise their children to help save on day care costs , according to a report from the Pew Research Center .<-->O
Day care costs have risen so high that the only way to afford it would be for both parents in a household to work , Pew reported .<-->O
That s why in general , married stay-at-home mothers are better off financially than their counterparts who are single or cohabitating , the Pew report found .<-->N
The report said they make choices to save on costs that single people don t make .<-->N
And stay-at-home mothers are usually married to a high-earning husband who covers both of their expenses .<-->N
Stay-at-home parents make their kids smarter .<-->N
Stay-at-home parents make their older kids smarter , according to a study from the Statistics Norway Research Department .<-->N
The study looked at the effects of Norway s Cash for Care program which gave money to parents who wanted to care for and educate their children at home , rather than send them to early education and how the beneficiaries children did later on in school compared to those who did not receive money from the program .<-->O
The study ultimately found that children whose parents did the Cash for Care program so , staying at home and raising their children got better test scores and better GPA averages than those who didn t. Those same stay-at-home parents are often sources of counsel and insight for their children when they grow older , too , the study said .<-->O
The results suggest that even older students in middle or elementary school could use guidance from their parents , Eric Bettinger , the study s researcher , told Quartz .<-->O
For years , we have known that parental presence is extraordinarily important in the very early childhood years .<-->O
What we re finding is that parents continue to be important much further along in a child s life than we had previously thought .<-->O
Stay-at-home moms are worth $ 117,000 a year .<-->N
How often does someone tell you that you re worth six figures ?<-->N
Well , according to a study cited by Fox News , stay-at-home moms are worth about $ 117,000 a year .<-->N
The study looked at the pay of 10 different jobs that require workers to perform the same tasks as a stay-at-home mom like cleaning , teaching and community building and the total came out to be $ 116,805 .<-->N
When the same study was done on working moms , it found their worth to be $ 68,405 .<-->N
`` I think a lot of people think we sit at home and have a lot of fun and do n't do a lot of work , '' said Samantha Russell , a New Hampshire mother of two , to Fox News .<-->O
`` But they should try cleaning their house with little kids running around and messing it up right after them . ''<-->O
Stay-at-home moms keep their kids thin .<-->N
Researchers from the University of Minnesota found that positive family dinners make children thinner .<-->N
The study said this was particularly true in cases where fathers were present at the table .<-->N
But maybe mom should be there , too , since when mom works , children gain weight .<-->O
That s the findings of a study from the journal Child Development cited by CNN .<-->N
The study found a slight increase in a child s weight when both their parents worked .<-->N
While this isn t necessarily a widespread trend , the findings did reveal something about the potential eating habits of working families , according to CNN .<-->O
Working mothers could be pressed for time , which could cause them to turn to fast food and restaurants , CNN reported .<-->O
Stay-at-home moms are happier with their lives .<-->N
That s right stay-at-home moms believe they have more worthwhile lives , at least according to data from the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom .<-->O
The Telegraph reported that the ONS found the people in Britain who reported being the happiest were mothers who stay home to raise their children .<-->N
The research said that stay-at-home mothers well-being is increased by their children , since they get joy out of raising their children and seeing them happy .<-->O
Workers are concerned about the economy and their jobs , which increases their stress levels , the research found .<-->O
This just goes to show that the idea that we are all at home depressed and unhappy looking after our own children which a lot of politicians would like to believe is simply wrong , said Laura Perrin , a mother , to The Telegraph .<-->O
Hard Choice for Moms : Work or Stay Home ?<-->N
Mothers with the financial means have long had the choice to go back to work or stay home after the birth of their children .<-->N
Today , however , more moms in all economic levels appear to be considering the stay home option - at least that 's what some experts suspect when they point to recent population surveys , which show all female employment numbers declining after decades of sustained growth .<-->O
`` The employment decline is apparent among all income groups , roughly equally , '' says Philip Cohen , PhD , associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .<-->N
Employment figures for married mothers with children under age 6 have dropped 7 % to 10 % since the peak years of 1997 to 2000 , depending on the income group , says Cohen .<-->N
Overall , the work participation rate for all women dropped 1.5 % from 2000 to 2004 , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .<-->F
This is significant because , for four decades , women 's labor participation rates consistently climbed , from 40.8 % in 1970 to 57.5 % in 2000 .<-->N
The phenomenon caused profound changes in American family , culture , and economy .<-->N
The shift in direction has some people wondering whether or not the sexual revolution at work is over and what may have caused the change .<-->N
What Are the Advantages of Mothers Staying at Home With Their Kids ?<-->F
While many mothers are in today 's workforce , some out of necessity and others by choice , have chosen to stay at home to care for their children .<-->N
There are many advantages to being available to your youngsters at all times .<-->N
Mary Eberstadt , an advocate of stay-at-home parenting and author of `` Home-Alone America : The Hidden Toll of Day Care , Wonder Drugs , and Other Parent Substitutes , '' argues that `` institutional care is a bad idea for parents who do have a choice because it raises the quotient of immediate unhappiness in various forms among significant numbers of children . ''<-->O
Consistent Discipline and Care Children enrolled in daycare and then later in school must become accustomed to a variety of discipline styles .<-->N
Some teachers are more lenient than others .<-->N
Others have very strict rules and guidelines for the children to follow .<-->N
This can confuse youngsters to have to `` read '' their caregivers and teachers as to how they should conduct themselves .<-->N
When children stay home with a parent , the parent has consistent rules and consequences .<-->N
When a child is ill , the child knows who will care for him .<-->O
The parent can easily make doctor and dental appointments without worrying about taking time off from work .<-->N
Familiar and Safe Surroundings Children who have a stay-at-home parent are always surrounded by a familiar environment .<-->N
They know where their toys and books are .<-->N
They do n't have to ask to get a drink of water or to go to the restroom .<-->N
They sleep in their own beds at naptime instead of a mat on the floor .<-->N
Having familiar and safe surroundings gives children comfort and security in their day-to-day lives .<-->O
No Travel Time Children who stay at home do not have to worry about catching a daycare bus or being shuttled between childcare facilities and school .<-->N
Mom may decide to take them to the zoo , shopping , or on other excursions but these are not normal , scheduled trips .<-->N
This reduces the risks of accidents and becoming separated from your child .<-->N
A stay-at-home mom may even reduce the number and/or expense of extra autos for the family .<-->N
Few Childcare Expenses A stay-at-home mom will not have the heavy childcare expense that most working mothers have to deal with .<-->O
Granted , the loss of one income can be monumental but if there are several children in the household , sometimes it is less expensive for one parent to stay at home to care for the children , especially if they are small .<-->O
Other than the occasional social night out , there is no need for expensive childcare workers or babysitters .<-->O
Mothers will not have to purchase work clothes , gasoline , bus fare , lunches or office supplies 4 .<-->N
To stay or not to stay at home To work or stay home that 's a decision many women need to make when they 've had a baby .<-->O
To ensure that their child is well taken care of , many mothers choose to stay home .<-->O
On the contrary , a study by American Psychological Association points out , working mothers may actually be the ones who are better off at raising children when compared to those who stay at home .<-->O
The study also reported that working mothers enjoyed better health , lesser signs of depression and contributed more to a child 's overall learning opportunities .<-->O
The ladies in Pune voice their opinions on the same .<-->N
Not true Stay-home mums are the ones who have to let go of their ambitions and desires in order to take care of their child , say a few .<-->N
Actor Manini Mishra says , `` The mother who stays home instead of working sacrifices her aspirations and career to ensure that her child is well taken care of .<-->O
It is not easy to stay home , look after the house and also take care of the child . ''<-->O
Manini feels that stay-home mums contribute as much as a working mother does or perhaps even more Absolutely right Women are known to be good at multitasking , point out others .<-->O
Multi-tasking directly relates more efficiency .<-->N
Actor Poonam Dhillon explains , `` Working women are always more capable and are good at multi-tasking .<-->N
Working mums put in a lot more effort to ensure they get to spend some quality time with their children too .<-->N
This contributes to the overall development of the child . ''<-->N
SOS Mummy !<-->N
Actor Smita Jaykar feels that stay-home mums make their children dependent on them for everything .<-->N
She explains , `` Stay-home mums tend to spoon-feed their children .<-->N
This curbs their independence . ''<-->N
Smita also says she finds that her children are a lot more independent than most kids their age .<-->N
Not applicable A few others are of the opinion that since these studies are conducted abroad , they have no relevance in India .<-->N
Actor Renuka Shahane stresses on the health aspect .<-->N
`` This study does not hold good for the women in India .<-->N
Whether a woman is working or not working , her work pressure remains the same .<-->N
In the west , once women are back home , they relax and rejuvenate .<-->N
That is not the case here .<-->N
A woman has to handle so many more things here , and that could lead to a lot ofstress , '' she explains .<-->N
Work is happiness Personal happiness is always a driving force while taking crucial decisions , feel others .<-->O
Actor Manjari Phadnis elaborates , `` The mothers who stay at home tend to centre their lives around their children .<-->N
Working mothers , on the other hand , learn to manage home and career and do both well .<-->N
And managing them both gives them a sense of accomplishment . ''<-->N
Do n't worry , be happy Film-maker Chitra Palekar feels that is ` no such thing as this is better than that ' .<-->O
`` If you are able to spend quality time with your child , then nothing like it .<-->N
Being happy and the providing the space your child needs is the way to go about it . ''<-->N
As long as both the mother and child are happy , it is bound to contribute to the growth of the child .<-->O
Why is it suddenly taboo to say mother should stay at home with their babies ?<-->N
My most vivid memory of my childhood is hovering outside our smart Kensington sitting room , which I was forbidden to enter , as my mother , a dressmaker , fitted garments to a series of rich clients .<-->O
Just a minute , darling , she d say on the rare moments she popped out to get some more pins , in answer to any query of mine .<-->N
In a minute .<-->N
We ll see .<-->F
And somehow my request would get forgotten , always second place to her work .<-->N
My mother always had scant interest in me as a child and I was brought up pretty much entirely by au pairs until I was eight , after which I was left to fend for myself .<-->O
True , my father was sometimes around , and what a wonderful father he was .<-->N
But it wasn t the same .<-->N
Father was working himself , teaching life-drawing at the Royal College of Art .<-->F
It was my mother I wanted .<-->N
I was an only child and I wanted her to make my tea , to care for me , show an interest .<-->O
Not always , just sometimes .<-->N
That s not to say Mother was all bad .<-->N
If she had been a slightly distracted older friend or relative , she would have been fine .<-->O
But as a mum ?<-->N
I m afraid she wasn t much good .<-->O
By the early Sixties , her neglect of me had deepened .<-->N
By now , Mother was really interested only in her career .<-->N
Indeed , she had been made Professor of Fashion at the Royal College of Art , a post so unusual for a woman that it merited a front-page story in the Daily Express .<-->N
Then , when I was 13 and after a series of pretty serious rows between her and my father , she left home for good .<-->O
Father and I had to fend for ourselves My childhood had been so dreadful , and I felt my mother s neglect so deeply that , to be honest , it was a bit of a relief when she left .<-->O
At least I knew she was gone for good none of this halfway house , being there one moment , abandoning me the next , which made me feel so insecure , so unstable .<-->O
These are the memories I draw upon in my role as an agony aunt .<-->N
And whenever I am asked about working mothers , I remember myself sitting outside that living room for hours on end , kicking my heels against the chair on which I sat , desperate for some attention from Mother .<-->N
I thought of that sad scene last week , when I received a letter from a young pregnant woman who had just been headhunted by a top firm .<-->O
They wanted her to start work as soon as possible .<-->N
Should she hand the baby over to her husband as soon as it was born , she asked ?<-->N
He was happy to be a house husband .<-->N
She was keen to do it , but her friends had advised her not to .<-->N
What did I think ?<-->N
As an agony aunt of more than 40 years , I ve often had letters on these lines and my reply has been the same , as it was last week .<-->N
Don t go back to work straight away .<-->N
Give the baby a chance to bond with you , for just a few months of your time at the very least , to give it a firm footing in life .<-->O
Of course , you should stay home .<-->N
A child needs its mother certainly for the first precious months .<-->O
But my answer was met with waves of abuse .<-->N
I was accused of not being a feminist .<-->N
I was mad .<-->N
I was a relic from another time .<-->N
It s time to kick this agony aunt to the kerb , wrote one blogger .<-->O
She declared that my advice was kneejerk Fifties backwash which reeked of vestiges of another time .<-->N
People emailed me personally .<-->N
Your advice patronises and belittles the role of both parents , wrote one .<-->N
You show no knowledge or compassion for the role that a parent performs for a baby .<-->O
Another damned me for writing a biased , patronising , parent-hating piece .<-->O
The furore took off online , spread to Radio 4 s Today programme , where I attempted to defend myself , and has since been the subject of fierce debate .<-->O
It s all been rather enlightening , to put it mildly .<-->N
It s shown me just how much the landscape has changed for working mothers today .<-->O
When I was young , mothers were made to feel guilty for going back to work at any time during their child s formative years .<-->O
But these days women are made to feel guilty if they don t go back to work straight after having a baby .<-->O
One young mum who visited me recently with her nine-month-old said she was made to feel awful by her contemporaries for staying at home with the baby .<-->O
People were always asking when she was going back to work .<-->N
But , as she pointed out , she d found there was nothing as fulfilling and absorbing as looking after a baby .<-->N
Although it was more demanding , it was far more interesting and fulfilling than her job , and beat working in an office hands down .<-->N
Indeed , the reasons I set out for encouraging the mother to stay with her baby for a year were simple and , I thought , reasonable .<-->O
This little mite would have been living inside its mum s body for nine months and , like all babies , would be extremely bewildered and disturbed to leave the comfort of her cosy womb into a world outside .<-->O
Having your mum around closely for the first few months of life , rather than being left in the sole care of your father , effectively a complete stranger , is crucial .<-->O
Lord knows I felt the full force of this myself , when my mother effectively abandoned me for her career .<-->O
The memory of the loss of my mother for it was a loss , as profound as any grief has shaped my own parental style , too .<-->O
I simply refused to leave my son Will , who is now a father himself , and managed to sneak in hours as a freelance writer when he was asleep .<-->N
I didn t want my baby to feel the neglect I did .<-->O
But , more than this , I didn t want to break the instinctive , intuitive connection with my child .<-->O
All devoted mothers will know what this feels like .<-->O
Not long after my son was born , I remember having a party for a few friends at home .<-->N
As he lay in a carrycot on the other side of the room , I had the all - powerful feeling that a piece of myself was lying over there .<-->O
I couldn t bear to be separated from him for even a few minutes that was my flesh and blood over there .<-->N
It was the most extraordinary experience , and I couldn t get enough of it .<-->O
But while my husband was totally besotted by our little chap from day one , there certainly was no such personality sea-change in him .<-->O
Obviously , there are times a mother must be separated from her child .<-->N
And if a women tragically dies in labour , I m sure any father would do a brilliant job of raising baby .<-->O
But if there was a choice , how many of us could argue against the intrinsic , biological bond between mother and child ?<-->O
Isn t the kindest , most humane and positive approach to let baby be around you , Mummy , with your familiar smell , sound and touch ?<-->O
Shouldn t you gradually ease him or her into a brand new life until they are old enough to fully comprehend that dad is just as much home as mum ?<-->O
In my full advice to the pregnant woman who asked if she should go straight back to work , I said once the baby was old enough to feel just as secure with its father as with its mother , she could go back to the office if she could bear to do so .<-->O
Indeed , most mums feel a real tug to stay with their children for longer than a year .<-->O
Indeed , many can t bear to give up the job of mothering until the child actually leaves home .<-->N
No wonder , then , that in a study of national happiness it was found stay-at-home mothers are more likely to think their lives are worthwhile than women who go to work .<-->O
They tend not to suffer from boredom , frustration or feelings of worthlessness .<-->O
They certainly won t ever feel that regret that some career women may well experience when they look back and realise that , however much they love their children when they re older , they ll never be able to re-capture those rapturous early months with their baby .<-->O
Despite the maelstrom of criticism I have received , my thoughts aren t anti-women .<-->N
I m not anti-women working .<-->N
I m not anti-men , or anti-parent or even anti-feminist .<-->N
I am one thing : entirely pro-child .<-->N
After all , it is the helpless little child who is the one who is most often ignored when we begin to shout about women s rights .<-->O
So despite the criticism , despite the brickbats of the past week , I still feel the same as I ever did .<-->O
When I hear of mothers going straight back to work after having a baby , I wonder , if they can t bring themselves to look after their tiny , helpless baby in those precious early days , why on earth do they bother having children in the first place ?<-->O
Should mothers stay at home to raise their children ?<-->N
In today s society , women often feel that to be seen as successful , they should have to balance their career , children and their marriage .<-->O
For many families , going back to work , after the birth of a child is a necessity , as they find it impossible to stop work due to financial concerns .<-->O
However , many people feel that this is bad for children , who then have to be looked after by an outside source during the day , such as a childminder or nursery school .<-->O
As early childhood is the most precious time of a child s development , it is important that the mother or indeed the father should be there for that child and devote as much time as possible .<-->O
By staying at home , mothers can ensure that their children have the best start in life , by giving them love and attention and turning away any future problems .<-->O
On the contrary , many people believe that mothers should have as much choice and freedom as anyone else in society , so that they can decide what is best for their children .<-->O
If they would rather work than look after their children , then why shouldn t they be given the choice to do so ?<-->O
Shouldn t this be considered equally valid ?<-->N
In many cases , women who are forced to give up work that they enjoy , fall into deep depression and find it hard to recover .<-->O
Subsequently , many childcare options are of very poor standard ; in some cases with only one adult looking after many children at once .<-->O
It can leave children bored , which in turn can slow their rate of development .<-->N
Those on low pay are often forced to rely on these options .<-->N
Although , many people have argued this case and as a result , it has been proven that many forms of childcare are actually beneficial to both the parent and the child .<-->O
For many centuries , it has been traditional for a member of the extended family , such as a grandparent , to help to look after the children , as they have had good experience before .<-->O
Similarly , childcare professionals are trained and have taken courses on which they are taught how to look after young children properly and in some cases even more knowledgeable , than the first time parent themselves .<-->O
Furthermore , playing with other children of a similar age is good for improving their social skills .<-->N
Mothers who stay at home are known to benefit the whole society .<-->N
Consequently , having more time , suggests that they are more likely to help out in the community or be a volunteer worker at a local organisation .<-->N
Above all , they will also be more involved in their child s education , for instance , going to PTA meetings , helping out on school trips , or even going to mother and toddler groups .<-->N
Mothers who stay at home are able to become fully involved in all these aspects of community life .<-->N
Of course on the other hand , encouraging women to work increases the workforce , which significantly increases the exports and productivity of the country .<-->N
Over time , this will also generate employment for even more people .<-->N
Because the whole society benefits from giving children the best start in life , don t you think that the government should do more to allow more women to stay at home to look after their kids ?<-->O
After all , it is the most important time of their lives .<-->N
Most women do have the legal right to maternity leave .<-->N
In the UK , this consists of 26 paid weeks and 26 un-paid weeks .<-->N
In some countries , this is offered to either parent up until the child is 18 months old .<-->N
Many people have argued that many women have actually no choice about whether to work or to stay at home ; either through money concerns or because they are single parents .<-->O
Women often feel that they have to work to provide enough money for their family .<-->N
Studies have shown that poverty has a lasting negative impact on children , regardless of having a mother at home .<-->O
Expecting mothers to stay at home also makes them very dependent on their partners .<-->N
Many religions and cultures view a woman s place , as being in the home .<-->N
Within this , they are clearly respected , for wanting to bring up their children , the best that they possibly can .<-->O
As motherhood is thought to be the most important role for women , those who do not have children will more than likely suffer from prejudice .<-->O
It will also deny them equal opportunities in most other areas of life .<-->O
Some people also think that by focusing all the child s attention on the mother , it often neglects the role of the father or other family members .<-->N
The father may not have as many opportunities in raising the child , therefore meaning the child may grow more attached to their mother .<-->N
To conclude , I can say that I agree with both points of view .<-->O
Personally , if I were to have children in the future , I would prefer to stay at home caring for my children , as I would like to spend as much time as possible with them and not miss out on the experience .<-->O
Also , if you and your partner decided to have kids in the first place , I think that you should take full responsibility of them , instead of just handing them over to someone else to look after .<-->O
I don t think this matter can be resolved , as I think that it should be the mother s own decision whether to look after her children or to earn her own living , as there are many different circumstances .<-->O
After all , isn t the mother s right to live how she wants to ?<-->O
Shouldn t she be able to decide what is best for her life ?<-->O
Ideally , should mothers stay at home to look after their children ?<-->N
In the age of apparent equality , women are increasingly encouraged to have it all , balancing career , children and marriage in order to be seen as successful .<-->O
Some feel this is bad for children who are then cared for by others .<-->O
Others feel that no harm comes to children if the alternative care is good and that children may in fact benefit if paid work makes the mother happier and her work improves the family s living standards .<-->O
Occasionally fathers will also decide to stay home as carers instead of mothers .<-->N
In many countries , mothers -LRB- and sometimes fathers -RRB- have a legal right to maternity -LRB- or paternity leave -RRB- .<-->N
The Czech Republic has the longest parental leave programme , lasting until the children are 2-3 years old and can be taken by either parent .<-->N
For UK women this comprises 26 weeks paid leave and 26 weeks unpaid leave .<-->N
Recently the British government has made changes so that this leave can be shared between partners as the parents see fit .<-->N
In Sweden , leave is offered to either parent until the child is 18 months old .<-->N
The USA does not have a national paid maternity leave program .<-->N
Other options exist , such as protecting the right to ask for part-time work or flexible hours .<-->O
However in many families , especially where the mother earns the majority of the family s income and may be the only earner , it is financially impossible for the mother to stop work without considerable state support , which in most cases doesn t exist .<-->O
Many studies point to the years before a child starts school as the most important in its educational and emotional development .<-->O
For this reason , should the mother be at home , at least until her children start school ?<-->O
Or can children develop equally well - or sometimes better - with support from others in addition to their mothers ?<-->O
What are your thoughts ?<-->N
Ideally , should the mom stay at home to look after her child ?<-->N
Felix Debate 01 : Mothers should stay at home and look after their children In the age of apparent equality women are increasingly encouraged to have it all , balancing career , children and marriage in order to be seen as successful .<-->O
Some feel this is bad for children who are then cared for by a child-minder , nursery , or member of the extended family .<-->O
Others feel that no harm comes to children if the alternative care is good and that children may in fact benefit if paid work makes the mother happier and her work improves the family s living standards .<-->O
Roy : For Felix : Against Roy Ahem ahem ahem , let me start by saying , that I have no idea why I was picked for this topic and I m probably going to lose .<-->N
Obviously any topic about women s rights is a losing one !<-->N
Blah blah blah , I want an abortion , blah blah I want to get paid time off to have a baby that I m going to abort !<-->O
This stinks .<-->N
Felix Eh , maybe we should change topics ?<-->N
Roy But I already read like two pages on this .<-->N
Let s just get this over with Felix Eh , okay then .<-->O
Maybe I should start !<-->N
Roy Go ahead .<-->F
Felix Alright !<-->N
The argument is that mothers should stay at home and look after their children .<-->O
But why should they ?<-->N
Is it fair to have mothers stay at home , while fathers are freely able to explore the things they want out of life ?<-->O
Sure , I d like it if my mom were always around to take care of me but I d never want to get in the way of the things she wanted to do .<-->O
Roy Okay , but what do women really want to do besides shop and look pretty ?<-->O
It s a win win !<-->N
You stay at home with the kid and take em out when you go to the store .<-->N
The guys doing all the work so you can basically do whatever you want !<-->O
I wish I was a woman !<-->N
Yup stay at home , and look at myself in the mirror all day .<-->N
Felix So , the idea is , eh women should stay at home cause it s fun ?<-->O
Roy Uhhhh .<-->N
Felix If I ask more questions , are you by any chance going to say something offensive ?<-->F
Roy Probably .<-->N
If you wan na call THAT offensive .<-->F
Felix -LRB- sigh -RRB- I guess I m done .<-->F
Roy Great !<-->F
For the record I didn t learn anything !!<-->N
Felix -LRB- I ve never understood why people hit their heads against the wall , but I think I m starting to get the idea . -RRB-<-->O
Do stay-at-home mothers upset you ?<-->N
You may be a motherist Dr Aric Sigman , at a conference convened by Mothers At Home Matter -LRB- if you want a clue , as to its agenda , I refer you to the name -RRB- , warned of the rise of `` motherism '' ; a prejudice against stay-at-home mothers .<-->O
Sigman is well known for his re-traditionalising intentions , to which end he has been accused of misrepresenting behavioural and neurological evidence , a claim he has denied .<-->O
So , he says `` motherism '' is dangerous because it puts women off being stay-at-home mothers , which is the developmental ideal .<-->N
I 'd reject the second part of the argument , but not the first there is a prejudice against stay-at-home mothers .<-->O
There is a presentation of women who look after their own children full time as air-headed , spoilt and dowdy .<-->N
However , there is also a prejudice against women who look after their children but are n't dowdy -LRB- yummy mummies -RRB- ; women who go back to work after having had children ; women who stay out of work but also employ nannies ; women who work part-time and look after their children the rest of the time .<-->O
I think the only way you could gain approval for your time-management , as a mother , would be to look after your children all the time as well as working full-time but for some socially useful enterprise -LRB- ideally voluntary work -RRB- , while never relying on a man for money , yet never claiming benefits either , but God forbid that you should have a private income .<-->O
Mothers in society act as whipping boys for almost all other social fissures ; oh , the irony of there being no female equivalent for the phrase `` whipping boy '' , when it is almost always a female .<-->O
Oh the side-spitting irony .<-->N
Here are four examples of `` motherisms '' at work : 1 -RRB- What they say : `` I do n't see why mothers need these enormous buggies '' If you were pushing anyone who could n't walk but was n't a baby , people would happily put themselves out a bit .<-->O
The act of pushing a baby , however , confers an aura of smugness about you -LRB- `` look at you , so in love , with your baby '' -RRB- that makes it unthinkable to just help you out .<-->O
There 's an element of sense in this ; mothers are in love with their babies , for the most part .<-->O
And they would see you step into a puddle just to avoid the smallest jolt to their airsprung sleeping chariot .<-->O
But it 's not the end of the sodding world , is it , mothers temporarily losing their social etiquette while they fall in love with their babies ?<-->O
What they say -LRB- at the school gates , whispered -RRB- : `` You never see the mother '' Even if the child is dropped off by the father , there is very little quarter given to the mother who is n't visible to the child 's social circle , and not much consideration of the possibility that maybe her work starts at 9am precisely so she can get home by 6pm .<-->O
I personally think this is a Freudian throwback , the resentment of children of the 70s and 80s , who were the first generation having to contend with bloody maternal no-shows at the harvest festival .<-->O
It 's the only rationale I can think of for why a person would think it was any of their business how a mother organised her time .<-->O
What they say -LRB- going in to a cafe , during the hours of standard economic activity -RRB- : ` Look at all these women who do n't work .<-->N
I wish I could afford not to work ' I personally think the greatest misconception around childcare , shared by a huge proportion of the adult population , the people who 've never done it , plus people who 've done it but ca n't remember it , is that it is easy .<-->O
It is by far the most demanding job conceived by society , wringing you out like a blood-drenched bedsheet , each day leaving you physically drained and mentally poleaxed , without even the energy to close your own mouth or hold your head upright , often making an involuntary gargling noise .<-->O
Some of it 's quite fun .<-->O
But anyway , that 's an aside .<-->N
There 's no economic sense to this question ; if the women drinking coffee were n't looking after their children , someone else would have to , which would in most cases cost as much as their wages .<-->O
So what people are really objecting to is not that mothers can afford not to work , but that they can still afford coffee .<-->O
What they say : ' I never have anything to say to these yummy mummies ' Dressed up as a deficiency of the speaker -LRB- I never have anything to say -RRB- it is actually a charge levelled at the mother , that she has no interests ; why ?<-->O
Because , being `` yummy '' , she is narcissistic and ca n't see beyond pilates and Brazilian hot waxing .<-->N
The true resentment is of her wealth that her life is n't one of drudgery and servitude , but spa treatments and interiors .<-->O
Well , that 's fine it 's possible to make a good case for objecting to wealth , since so much of it is unjustly come by .<-->O
But at least object to the people unjustly coming by it .<-->O
It seems a little tangential to make the wife the object of the opprobrium .<-->O
All she 's done is have a kid and fancy up her pubic area .<-->O
Staying at home : Pros and cons What the experts say Some experts in early childhood development believe there 's no substitute for the consistency and nurturing of parental care , especially if the alternative is poorly funded childcare .<-->O
Two groundbreaking studies , one conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the other by the Institute of Child Development of the University of Minnesota , found that kids who spent all day in daycare had higher levels of stress and more aggression than kids cared for at home .<-->O
Follow-up research in 2010 confirmed these results , showing the continued negative impact of low-quality daycare on young children , even after they reached adolescence .<-->N
But other studies contradict these findings , and most experts believe that the quality , not the type of childcare , is what 's most important .<-->O
A greatnanny , babysitter , daycare center worker , relative , or other caregiver can make sure your child gets the stimulation and affection she needs to grow and thrive .<-->O
What are the advantages of being a stay-at-home parent ?<-->N
As a stay-at-home parent you 'll know that your child is being cared for by someone who 's going to be around for a long time , not a caregiver who might take another job next month .<-->O
And you 'll be directly supervising your child 's care , making sure it 's in a relaxed , nurturing environment .<-->O
And you 'll be there to see all those `` firsts , '' which can be incredibly satisfying .<-->N
Says mom Molly Olsen , `` Staying home with Ezra allowed me to really focus on him and be in touch with his emotional and physical milestones .<-->O
I 'm glad it was me and not a teacher who saw him sit up or laugh for the first time . ''<-->O
Margie Johnson , who 's been a stay-at-home mom for 24 years with seven kids , says staying home has fulfilled her more than anything else could .<-->N
`` It 's the most rewarding ` career ' you could ever have , '' she says .<-->O
`` You 're irreplaceable to your child , and you 're making an ongoing personal investment that will outlive you . ''<-->N
-LRB- Johnson is on the board of directors of the Family and Home Network , a nonprofit organization dedicated to encouraging mothers or fathers to stay home with their children . -RRB-<-->O
For some families , it 's actually less expensive for one parent to stay home than it would be to pay for childcare .<-->O
-LRB- Read more about measuring the cost of staying home . -RRB-<-->N
And if you can afford it , you may find that staying home reduces your stress level .<-->N
Many parents decide to stay home after trying unsatisfactorily to balance work and family .<-->N
The long hours and the feeling of cutting too many corners leaves them feeling burned out .<-->O
Staying home will give you more time to spend with your children , maintain your home , and help keep your family life running smoothly .<-->N
What are the disadvantages ?<-->N
For some people , loneliness tops the list .<-->N
If you 're accustomed to the camaraderie and stimulation of being surrounded by other adults at work , the change of pace can lead to feelings of depression .<-->N
Stay-at-home dads may feel doubly isolated because there are so few of them .<-->O
`` There are n't any other stay-at-home dads just around the block , '' says Jay Massey , who cares for his son and used to run a website for at-home dads called Slowlane .<-->O
Moms and dads who were n't happy about leaving the workplace behind can feel even more alienated .<-->O
`` I had a hard time connecting with other stay-at-home moms , '' says Ann Nicholas , who 's now back in the work force part-time .<-->O
`` I felt we did n't have a lot in common . ''<-->N
If your career has been an important part of how you see yourself , you may feel a loss of identity .<-->O
Your self-esteem may suffer without the appreciation of a boss and colleagues .<-->N
After all , you do n't get a lot of positive feedback from a needy newborn or tantrum-throwing toddler .<-->N
Changing diapers and tackling endless loads of laundry can be boring and frustrating .<-->O
You may have to look hard for a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction .<-->O
Plus , finding time for yourself when you 're home with an attention-seeking baby or toddler can be impossible even a crowded , busy office offers more privacy .<-->O
`` I often felt like I was lost , without much identity , '' Olsen says .<-->O
`` I felt like I was always mommy first , then wife , and then me , if I had any time left . ''<-->O
You may also find yourself worrying about when and how you 'll resume your career and whether you 'll be penalized for taking time off .<-->N
And while you wo n't be shelling out thousands of dollars each year for childcare , choosing to stay home is a complicated economic decision .<-->N
Many families with a stay-at-home parent find they have to budget carefully and devote more time to bargain hunting than before .<-->O
You might have to substitute camping trips for hotel vacations , cook at home instead of eating out regularly , and make other lifestyle choices that may not be appealing .<-->O
Also , as your child grows into toddlerhood and becomes more active and social , he 'll miss out on the automatic socialization that happens in daycare and other group care situations .<-->O
Some stay-at-home parents find that after a certain age , providing enough stimulation is challenging .<-->O
Finally , choosing to stay home could create new tensions between you and your partner if he or she is n't fully supportive of the idea .<-->O
So make sure you discuss all the repercussions thoroughly before making this weighty decision .<-->N

1 Sexting happens more than you think .<-->N
The circulating of nude and explicit photos is a much more regular occurrence then most parents realize .<-->O
According to Cosmo Girl , 22 % of teenage girls and 20 % of teenage boys have sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves over the Internet or from their cell phone .<-->N

2 Sexting can lead to sex .<-->N
A 2009 study done by the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy found that 29 % of teens think that if photos of a sexual nature are shared that dating or sex is expected ; this perceived expectation can lead to earlier sexual activity .<-->O
3 Inappropriate use can lead to jail time .<-->N
Authorities are starting to crack down on sexting and the sending of nude pictures of teenagers .<-->N
Sharing nude photos is considered child pornography , even if a child of the same age is sending it .<-->N
A recent arrest was made of an underage male that sent a nude picture of himself to his 15 year old girlfriend .<-->N
He also received one back from her .<-->N

A study done by the National Sleep Foundation found that 1 in 5 teens age 13 to 18 are awakened by a call or text message a few times a week .<-->N
7 Phone use can hamper family interaction : Cell phones can become your child s world .<-->N
The more children text and talk with their friends , the less face-to-face time they spend with their family .<-->N
Digital media expert Patricia Greenfield explained in an interview with the New York Times that if you hold off getting your child a cell phone you will maintain better communications between you and your child .<-->O
8 Phones are a pain to replace .<-->N
Cell phones are expensive and younger children tend to be less responsible than older teenagers .<-->O

5 Reasons Your Kid Should Not Have A Cell Phone I ll admit it .<-->N
I m a dinosaur among my friends because I won t get my kids a cell phone .<-->N
My daughters , aged 9 and 11 , remind me of that daily with pleas of I m the only one without a phone ; all my friends have one .<-->N
Why can t I ?<-->N
So , because I didn t want to sound like my mother who always countered with If everyone was jumping off a bridge , would you do it too ?<-->O
, I decided to look for a better answer .<-->O
I was shocked to discover that 21 % of children 8 years and younger use smart phones !<-->N
Wow younger than 8 !<-->N
And 78 % of children aged 12 to 17 already have a cell phone .<-->N
But before you add your kid to your cellular plan , consider why waiting could be a better option .<-->O
Privacy Concerns You may be surprised to find out that only 61 % of youth use privacy settings on their social media sites and 52 % don t turn off their location or GPS services .<-->F
This leaves their locations visible to strangers .<-->N
But the scariest revelation to me was that 14 % of children have posted their home addresses online .<-->N
And before you say , OH my child would NEVER do anything like that , because we ve had the talk with them ; realize this study also revealed that almost 70 % of the youth polled admitted to hiding their online activities .<-->N
Add this to the fact that less than half of the parents are aware of what their child is doing online .<-->O
Regrets So what exactly are the kids doing online with their smartphones ?<-->N
Since 1 in 4 teens are cell-mostly internet users , saying they mostly go online using their phone , parents need to realize this is their access to the online world .<-->O
The phones really aren t just for talking anymore .<-->O
They are use for texting , surfing , social media , pictures , and yes even sexting .<-->N
1 in 4 use their phones primarily as a computer for online access , the other 75 % use their tablets or other mobile device .<-->N
So even if you think they re not online because they don t have a phone - ask yourself - do they have a tablet , an iPod , an iPad , a kindle ?<-->N
These need to be monitored just as heavily as smart phones .<-->O
The Digital Deception study in 2013 revealed that nearly half of all teens say they ve posted something online that they later regretted .<-->N
This regret can cause more than embarrassment .<-->O
It can cost careers .<-->N
Because Onedevice Research discovered that 8 % of US people aged 16 to 34 have been turned down for a job because of their social media profile .<-->N
And let s not ignore the regret of Sexting .<-->N
It s taken more than one Weiner down -LRB- Anthony Weiner , the former US congressman to be exact -RRB- .<-->N
And a study performed by USC researchers discovered that 20 % of teenagers said they d received a sext , but only about 5 % admitted to having sent one .<-->N
The July issue of the journal Pediatrics found that among 1,300 middle school students , ranging from 10 to 15 years old and anonymously sampled , that they were more likely to report being sexually active if they also were sending more than 100 texts a day .<-->N
That drew a direct correlation that stated , Our results show that excessive , unlimited , or unmonitored texting seems to enable sexting .<-->O
And if that s not enough , over half of the kids aged 10 to 17 admitted to posting risky comments or photos online .<-->N
All the while , 25 % of them said they use their mobile device to hide this type of online behavior from their parents .<-->N
Ten Reasons Why a Kid Should Have a Cell Phone It s hard to remember what we did without cell phones connecting us to our friends , family and the world at large .<-->O
Many of us use them to chat and tweet our every given thought whenever we feel like it .<-->O
We call and text each other regularly , letting a friend know we re lost or running late .<-->O
We remind a spouse to pick something up on the way home from work , and we check in on long-distance relatives while we re stuck in traffic .<-->N
Our kids are also part of the mix when it comes to cell phones .<-->N
Grade-schoolers , tweens and teens all want a cell phone .<-->N
If you re on the fence about it , there are 10 solid reasons to justify getting your child a cell phone .<-->N
Practicality Both kids and parents are busy these days , and it makes sense for parents to be able to call their kids and let them know they re running late when picking them up for school or activities .<-->O
It also makes sense for children to be able to call their parents to tell them extra-curricular activities are running late or they will be late for dinner .<-->O
Safety Earthquakes , fires , bad weather , traffic accidents there are many things that can happen during the day after your children leave the house for school .<-->N
Cell phones are a lifeline between a parent and their children , and cell phones also can be used to call emergency responders .<-->N
Necessity If your child needs to get in touch with you because they re running late , or they decide to go to a movie at the mall , there are few pay phones left for them to use to call you .<-->O
Responsibility A cell phone gives your child a way to be more responsible and let you know if they re going to be late .<-->N
Cell phones are also important for teenagers , who could find themselves at a party without a sober ride home and need to call you to pick them up .<-->O
Trust Cell phones aren t cheap .<-->N
Giving your child a cell phone tells him that you trust him with something of value .<-->N
You are also telling your child that you are trusting him to use his allocated minutes wisely .<-->O
Divorce When parents are divorced , a cell phone is a good way for a child to keep in contact with both parents at all times , and it gives the parent who does not live in the same home as the child a good opportunity to stay involved .<-->O
Extended Family & Military Families Cell phones are a good incentive for kids to keep in contact with long-distance relatives , like grandparents or aunts and uncles .<-->N
Cell phones also enable kids to keep in touch with a parent who is overseas in the military , and who may have limited times when they can connect with a phone call .<-->O
Games Cell phones now come with many fun , inexpensive games that kids can play with to keep them busy while waiting in long lines or for a doctor or dentist appointment .<-->O
Reminders Cell phones come with alarms , note-taking applications and all kinds of apps that will help keep your child organized and remind them of their next test or homework assignment .<-->N
Social Communications Cell phones are deeply woven into our social fabric .<-->N
Teens use social media to text , tweet or post their feelings , detail their likes and dislikes , and basically help them feel connected to their peers and the world around them .<-->O
TOP 10 Reasons Kids Have Cell Phones Where we live most kids have cell phones by age 10 on average .<-->N
Here are the top 10 reasons why : 1 -RRB- By middle school or junior high just , about all kids carry a cell phone , or `` cell '' at all times , so it makes them feel grown-up , like you trust them with something of value .<-->O
2 -RRB- Many kids take medication and/or have allergies and could need sudden attention .<-->O
It is a safety issue really , so in an emergency they can always contact someone .<-->N
3 -RRB- Most kids have working parents that need to be contacted after school or from activities .<-->N
4 -RRB- The phones are generally not used during the day until high school , when kids mainly text message and make some calls between classes and after school as well , usually to coordinate plans or call for rides .<-->N
5 -RRB- There are no or very few `` pay phones '' left in our area , so cells are the only way to reach people from public places .<-->N
6 -RRB- Cells are great on weekends too for divorced families so kids can always reach the parent with whom they are not staying and the other parent can reach the child without having to go through the x-spouse .<-->O
7 -RRB- There are great free or inexpensive games for entertainment in the car or in waiting areas .<-->O
8 -RRB- They are just part of socialization here , as the home phone was when we were kids , except they have photos , videos , games and music as added value .<-->O
9 -RRB- As far as the safety of the cells , my kids text , play games , and use the photos and video , more than they even talk on the phones .<-->N
They do not talk long when they do talk , usually just calls to make plans and have brief conversations .<-->O
Unfortunately , cordless home phones also have similiar `` Brain Cancer '' warnings anyway .<-->N
I 'm not convinced any technology including wireless Internet is completely healthy or safe , but not terribly worried either because we would probably know by now if it were extremely risky .<-->O
Obviously , if studies show increasing harm , I would reconsider exposing my children or myself to those risks .<-->O
10 -RRB- Since our A T & T phones were free , and we share minutes that also rollover each month if not used , it is not much more of an additional expensive .<-->O
We can save almost as much because do n't need a home phone at all really .<-->O
Talking Point : Should children have mobile phones ?<-->F
They are the new mobile generation .<-->F
Increasing numbers of children , some as young as six , are now being given mobile phones .<-->N
In fact , a recent study by The Marketing Store found that 73 % of British 10-year-olds own a mobile , as do 24 % of eight-year-olds and 6 % of six-year-olds .<-->N
The reason behind this might be because mums and dads simply succumb to nagging , but more often than not , it s to ease parents safety fears when their kids are out and about .<-->O
While children having a mobile connection may help parents feel their kids are safer though , it s important to remember there s much more to modern mobiles than just the handset .<-->O
An additional survey by mobile phone insurance company , mobileinsurance.co.uk , showed that 58 % of parents admit they don t keep an eye on what their children -LRB- under 10 -RRB- are actually using their mobiles for , raising obvious concerns that children may be accessing unsuitable content on the internet , or being bullied via their mobiles .<-->O
When asked why they didn t check , 42 % of parents said they never got round to it , 27 % didn t want to intrude on their child s privacy , and 13 % said they trusted their youngster .<-->O
Jason Brockman , director of mobileinsurance.co.uk , warns parents they have to be more alert .<-->N
It s not a case of invading children s privacy , it should be seen as a way of keeping them safe , he stresses .<-->N
Unrestricted internet access , talking to strangers and bullying aren t the only problems with children s mobile phone use either .<-->N
Figures released by the Office for National Statistics earlier this year revealed that mobile phone theft victims are most likely to be youngsters aged 14 to 17 years , with their victimisation rate being twice as high as the average , at around 4 % .<-->O
To try to reduce the chances of children s mobiles being stolen , it s a good idea to get an old , cheap handset perhaps one passed down by a parent or an older sibling .<-->O
Sadly though , whatever the type of mobile a child owns , figures suggest using any one puts them at greater risk of being injured or killed in a road accident .<-->O
The road safety lobbying group RoadSafe and AXA car insurance recently found that 11 years old is both the highest accident risk age for child pedestrians and the average age a child receives their first mobile phone .<-->N
By the age of 12 , 25 % of kids admit they ve been distracted by personal technology when crossing a road .<-->N
Jeremy Todd , chief executive of parenting charity Family Lives , says : It s clear that mobile phones can be a potential distraction for children and indeed adults as they walk the streets , with texting and social media messages a particular concern .<-->O
Children may be unaware of the risks around them when out and about on busy streets , so it s vital that parents sit down with them to discuss the potential risks of using mobile phones when out in public .<-->O
Todd acknowledges that giving a child a mobile phone can be a difficult decision for parents , and urges them to ask themselves whether their child really needs a mobile phone , and whether they d actually be able to use it in an emergency .<-->O
If you re getting a phone , pick one you feel your child can manage .<-->N
There s no point in having an all singing , all dancing phone if they aren t going to be able to work it , he advises .<-->N
Again though , it can seem that the pros outweigh these cons , with some separated parents liking their children to have mobile phones because it s easier to keep in touch with them , and many parents also feeling more confident about giving their child more independence , for example walking home from school alone , if they have the safety net of a mobile .<-->O
So , if you have decided it is right for your child to have a mobile , what boundaries do you need to set ?<-->O
Firstly , rules should be made about the time spent talking on the phone , so you don t get astronomical phone bills .<-->O
Parents need to talk openly to children about extra costs that might be incurred if they use the internet for example .<-->O
Also speak openly and clearly about cyberbullying , and encourage your children to talk to an adult if they have any concerns about this .<-->O
Todd also suggests parents might want to ban the mobile phone in the bedroom at night , as research shows that children -LRB- and adults -RRB- don t sleep as soundly if the mobile is by the bed .<-->O
The mobile should also be banned at other times , he says , like meals , or when children are supposed to be doing their homework .<-->O
Parents of older children should also ensure they understand the potential dangers and consequences of sending explicit photos or sexual texts .<-->O
Basically though , if you have any doubts about your child using their mobile , monitor the situation and let them know that you ll be checking as and when you see fit , Todd stresses .<-->O
They need to prove to you that they can be responsible .<-->O
Parents can ask their children s mobile provider to block access to websites unsuitable for the under 18s .<-->N

YOUNG Joseph Brook tends not to stray far from his Newsome home .<-->N
But like most nine-year-old boys , some times that spirit of adventure takes over .<-->O
Hence the mobile phone in his pocket .<-->N
And the message from mum Emma and dad Mat : Tell us where you are going .<-->N
Joseph , a pupil at Newsome Junior School , has the phone with him when he s out playing with friends and brother Charlie and sister Ruby in the fields and gardens near his Berry View home .<-->N
Like many of his friends , he has had the Pay as You go mobile for a few months .<-->N
Mum Emma said : He s not allowed to take it to school nor when he goes to Cub Scouts , but at other times he does carry it with him .<-->N
It is mainly so that I or Mat can check on where he is .<-->N
He is sensible but if he tells me he s going to play in the field and then disappears into a friend s home , at least he can ring or text me to let me know .<-->O
Many times I have gone out to look for him and he s in a friend s house so the phone is vital .<-->O
But she has no plans to upgrade the mobile .<-->N
It s a Pay As You Go model which lets him make phone calls and send texts , and it has one game on it .<-->N
SHE S an expert on families and a mum herself .<-->N
And University of Huddersfield lecturer Dr Abigail Locke concedes there are many reasons why young children should be given mobile phones .<-->N
But her oldest daughter won t be getting her own mobile until she s 11 and moving up to high school .<-->N
Dr Locke admits : I may not be popular in our house but that s the way I feel .<-->N
My daughter is nine at the moment and continually pestering me to get her a phone , saying all her friends have one .<-->N
There are two issues here .<-->N
One is that I can see that some parents will give in to the constant demands , the nagging from their children , who claim they are the only ones without a phone .<-->O
They see their peers using a phone and want to be the same .<-->N
But more importantly there is the safety angle .<-->N
There has been some research work done recently called Paranoid Parenting which talks about the pressures on parents to be constantly checking where their sons or daughters area .<-->N
We are living in a high-risk society and it is a different world to what it was a generation ago .<-->N
Parents do give their children mobiles to ensure they can contact them at any time and it is of help when children are making their own way to school , as they do when they move on up to high school .<-->O
But mobiles do bring other risk factors with access to the internet and websites .<-->N
We have heard many harrowing examples of teenagers and older children being totally unable to cope with messages and texts aimed at them on social media and it would very worrying to think that primary school children could be exposed to those risks .<-->O
Mobile phones are good from a safety point of view but my own thinking is proceed with caution .<-->O
THESE days , there are a staggering six billion mobile phones in use .<-->N
Many of those are tiny lightweight devices that do everything bar make the tea .<-->N
And technology has come a long way since the very early days .<-->N
Telephone engineers began experimenting with calls from trains in 1924 in Germany , and from cars in 1946 .<-->N
But it was not until 1973 that Motorola engineers John Mitchell and Dr Martin Cooper made the first commercial cellphone .<-->F
It was labelled The Brick weighing in at a colossal 2.2 lb , or 1kg , which is the equivalent to a bag of sugar .<-->N
The first text message to a mobile phone wasn t sent until 1992 , when a British computer engineer successfully sent a message .<-->N
Now there are millions of text messages sent every day .<-->N
The mobile phone industry is big business and the three biggest players are Samsung , Nokia and Apple .<-->F
But there are also risks police across many parts of the world say that one in every three robberies involves a mobile phone .<-->F
Good Reasons Why a Child Should Have a Phone You might be considering getting a cell phone for your child , but perhaps you 're unsure whether she 's ready to handle the responsibility .<-->O
One-fifth of children already own a cell phone at the age of 8 , according to a 2011 survey conducted by Bridgewater State University for the Massachusetts Aggression Research Center .<-->N
Determining when your child is ready for a cell phone is contingent on her maturity level , family circumstances and whether she needs one , according to author Scott Steinberg , as cited on the Parenting website .<-->O
When the time is right , a cell phone can provide your child with safety and security , and give you peace of mind .<-->O
Emergencies If your child finds himself in a potentially dangerous situation , such as being approached by a stranger , being followed home from school or suddenly becoming ill , having a cell phone can be crucial in obtaining help .<-->O
Using his cell phone , your child will be able to quickly call you , the proper authorities or emergency responders , according to Family Education .<-->O
You can program specific phone numbers into his cell phone , such as his physician , local police precinct , fire department and 911 .<-->N
Instruct your child not to wait until something bad actually happens , but immediately call for help whenever he feels threatened , frightened or unwell .<-->O
Staying Connected Cell phones allow you to stay connected with your child at all times .<-->N
You can call to ask a question , change plans , remind him of an appointment , tell him you 'll be late picking him up from baseball practice , offer support during his first day of school or simply say that you love him .<-->O
Cell phones can also be a convenient communication tool in your home -- when your child is in his bedroom , a text message reminds him to do his homework or that it 's dinnertime .<-->N
Your child 's cell phone also helps to ease homesickness while he 's away at camp or spending the weekend at Grandma 's house .<-->N
Navigation Even a short walk to school , a neighborhood store or a friend 's house can be confusing to a child , and he might lose his way .<-->O
A cell phone with GPS navigation can provide him with easy-to-follow directions while he 's on route , according to Wired .<-->N
The GPS shows him exactly where he is at all times and guides him to the destination with an easy-to-follow interactive map .<-->N
You can program the GPS with his destination , and it will provide directions to the location and also the route back home .<-->N
You might say , `` I know you 've walked to Joey 's house before , but I still want you to follow the map on your phone . ''<-->O
Tracking Providing your child with a cell phone allows you to always know where he is .<-->N
Most cell phone carriers offer family locator services that allow you to constantly monitor your child 's location through interactive satellite maps on your own cell phone or computer , according to Wired .<-->N
The family locator service will also send you a text message alert when your child reaches his destination and when he leaves it .<-->N
And it works both ways -- your child will be able to track your location , such as when you 're late picking him up at school and he can see on the map that you 're on your way .<-->O
Responsible Cell Phone Use Before buying your child a cell phone , discuss cell phone responsibility and lay the ground rules , recommends pediatrician Gwen O Keeffe , as cited on the Time website .<-->N
Inform him that he 'll be expected to follow the rules for cell phone use at his school , including turning it off during classes and study periods .<-->N
List the hours he wo n't be allowed to use the cell phone at home , such as while doing homework and at bedtime .<-->N
If he receives any sexually explicit or inappropriate photos , messages or phone calls , he should immediately report them to you and a school official .<-->O
Warn your child to never read or send text messages while walking or crossing the street .<-->N
Stress that the rules for cell phone use will be strictly enforced and if he violates any of them , his cell phone privileges will be removed .<-->O

so , What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone ?<-->N

This does not mean , however , that acquiring a cell phone is a child s right .<-->O
Before purchasing a phone for your child , it would be good to discuss this aspect of cell phone ownership so that he has the right perspective concerning this product .<-->O
You don t want your child thinking that just because his best friend received a new iPhone for his 12th birthday , he has a right to receive the same .<-->O
This kind of mentality indicates a lack of maturity on his part .<-->O
Children and mobile phones don t always go together well .<-->N
Before deciding on the right age for a mobile , parents should take into consideration the mental and emotional maturity of their child .<-->O
As your children grow older , it is only natural for them to begin comparing various aspects of their life with their peers .<-->N

This is a time where many parents begin to worry about the safety of their kids , especially if they have no way to keep in touch during the time they are away .<-->O
The preteen years -LRB- 11-12 -RRB- begin to add another dimension to a child s life .<-->N
Most preteens are involved in extracurricular activities that keep them away from home beyond school hours .<-->N
They may join a sports team or club , take dancing or music lessons or simply spend more time with their friends .<-->N
At this age , most parents recognize the importance of their children having a cell phone in order to get in touch with them if they have need .<-->O
By the time a child reaches adolescence , cell phone usage will be second nature to them .<-->N
Approximately 85 % of teenagers today age 14 to 17 have a mobile phone of their own .<-->N
Some use the device maturely while others don t. Teens that were taught to use a cell phone responsibly when they were younger may have fewer problems handling the device when they are older as compared to children who were given free rein with a mobile to do as they please .<-->O
There are many factors to consider when thinking about What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone .<-->O

Contemporary mobiles can be used for making phone calls , checking emails , downloading information from the Internet , listening to music or audio files , playing games , watching movies , taking pictures , as location finding devices and more .<-->N
Of course , not all phones come fully loaded with all of these applications and not all children need a phone that is capable of all these functions .<-->O
Younger children do not really need a phone with so many extras .<-->O

As a parent , you will need to discern whether a phone of this nature will be a benefit or detriment to his welfare .<-->O
Advanced cell phone technology may be all the rage for teens today , but it s not always the best neither is the high cost .<-->O
Many parents are open to buying their teen a quality device , but if he insists on the latest technology , they often suggest he pay for it on his own .<-->N
This may help him think twice about what he really needs .<-->O
At least it will make him value and care for his investment more .<-->O
What is the Right Age for a Mobile Phone ?<-->N

It s sad that children nowadays get bullied for not keeping up with the Jonses , but it s true .<-->O
Statistics show that almost 90 % of teenagers own a cell phone .<-->N
It s easy to imagine a teen not calling a friend because they re afraid that the friend s dad will answer the phone .<-->O
Not having a cell phone can make a child an outcast at school .<-->N
Heck , if your child does have a cell phone , but not a nifty phone case , he might get some flack for it .<-->O
Whether you like it or not , children can be mean and judgmental .<-->O
CONS Those pros are great , aren t they ?<-->N
Well , they might not be so great after you read the cons .<-->O
Your child may develop entitlement issues .<-->N
If you buy your 8-year-old a brand new iPhone , she will feel entitled to a brand new car when she turns 16 , a swanky apartment when she enters college , and so on .<-->O
There s a way to prevent your child from developing entitlement issues , and it s to buy her a cheap , used , and/or basic cellphone and save the fancy ones for when she gets old enough to understand the value of a dollar or just don t give her a cell phone until she s older .<-->O
Your choice .<-->N
Owning a cell phone makes your child more prone to bullying .<-->N
As if being online wasn t bad enough , now you have to worry about cell phones !<-->O
A cell phone gives your child another way to communicate with other kids .<-->N
Bullying can occur via text messaging -LRB- or prank calls -RRB- .<-->N
If your child s not being bullied , don t sigh just yet .<-->N
He could be the bully .<-->N
Your child may not be responsible enough for a cell phone .<-->N
I once heard a story about a 15-year-old boy who received nude pictures of his 15-year-old girlfriend via text message .<-->N
He shared the pictures with all of his friends , and his girlfriend eventually found out .<-->F
She blew the whistle and he was accused of distributing child pornography .<-->N
The court deemed his parents responsible and they were slapped with a huge fine .<-->O
The point of this story is , that you could get in a lot of trouble -LRB- or lose a lot of money -RRB- because of something your child did on his cell phone .<-->O
He could break the phone , call an expensive hotline , or do something serious that would get you in trouble with the law .<-->O
So , what to do ?<-->N
My personal opinion is to both give and take .<-->N
Stick with the pros , keep in mind the cons but I recommend not to over-do either side .<-->N
They want a mobile ?<-->N
They can have one for the pure reason of contact .<-->N
That should be taught as well .<-->N
They do not own a cell phone to have a status symbol and to show it around to other children .<-->N
It should be used for what it s intended for : necessary communication .<-->N
If they have their facts right they are more likely to survive school without being bullies or bullied .<-->O
Be creative !<-->N
If your child still comes home saying she has been told off by her friends for not having a fancy phone , make it fancy .<-->O
There are lovely phone cases and charms even grown-ups would envy .<-->O
Those can add style to an older phone but you can still stick to your principles .<-->N
They will get to an age , where you can set goals for them to reach to get a newer model , but try to keep small steps .<-->N
If you personally don t own the latest mobile , should your child do ?<-->N
10 Reasons a Kid Should Have a Cell Phone Just about every child , from middle school to teenager , wants to have his own cell phone .<-->N
This is a dilemma for parents because of the many downsides to letting a children have his own phone , such as higher cell phone bills and excessive time spent on the new gadget .<-->O
But there are many upsides to letting your child have a cell phone , which parents should consider before making the decision .<-->N
Security You are able to call or text your children at all times so you know where they are and what they are doing .<-->O
Relief You will also find yourself relieved of worry waiting up for your child at night when he or she has gone out with friends .<-->O
If your child is running late , she only has to give you a quick phone call to let you know she ll be arriving soon .<-->N
Emergencies If something were to happen , such as your child getting into a car accident or being stuck at a party , he will be able to reach you and let you know what is happening .<-->O
Something Happens to Your Child Also , if something happens to your child that makes him incapable of calling you himself , someone else can use his phone to call your number stored under the contacts .<-->N
Displaying Trust Giving your children a cell phone lets them know that you trust them to talk with their friends .<-->O
Bestowing Responsibility It can also be a method of teaching your children responsibility as they learn to control their minutes and the number of texts they send .<-->N
Reward A cell phone can also be used as a reward , showing your children that you are proud of them .<-->O
Conversely , it can be used as a form of discipline by taking the cell phone away when your child has misbehaved .<-->N
GPS Tracker Some cell phones have a GPS tracker built into the device .<-->F
This allows a parent to keep track online of their child s location .<-->N
An older child may be offended by this invasion of privacy , but it is perfect for young children .<-->N
Cost Many parents may not want to give their child a cell phone because they fear the size of their phone bill each month .<-->O
However , if you don t allow your child to have a web-enabled phone , keep them from downloading ring tones and limit their minutes , it doesn t cost too much to add your child onto an existing plan .<-->O
Control Many child phones also give the parent a great deal of control , with just a few buttons for Mom , Dad or other emergency contacts .<-->O
Felix Debate 02 : Science is a Threat to Humanity I m using the term humanity rather loosely here .<-->O
: j On the idebate.org webpage , this argument is clearly one sided so it ll be interesting if my choice of characters can give a more leveled discussion .<-->O
Silas : For Wren : Against Silas Who amongst us hasn t relied on science at some point ?<-->N
From cell phones to computers , our world is governed by marvels of scientific theory .<-->N
There is little doubt that science provides a sense of progress , however as science progresses we as people devolve .<-->O
Our need to constantly rely on science will lead not only lead to the destruction of ourselves but the earth as well .<-->O
Wren The only thing that will lead to destruction of people , is people .<-->N
There s rarely knowledge that can t be construed for purpose of mal-intent .<-->N
If you hand out knives to convicts , someone most likely will be stabbed .<-->O
Would you deem knives as something to be diminished simply because cutting a steak isn t as significant as killing someone ?<-->N
Knowledge , like a knife , is a tool and it , like any other tool , most be handled appropriately .<-->O
Silas You claim knowledge to be a tool .<-->N
Who among us decides what is and isn t appropriate use for this tool ?<-->N
People have been debating the use of guns since their very inception , do you actually believe the government has any control of what people do , assuming the government is even to be trusted .<-->O
Wren As I ve stated , the only thing that leads to the destruction of people , is people , and I m quite certain the government constitutes as people .<-->O
From what I ve gathered your solution is to stifle people s minds and let them roam around mindlessly following a set of idealistic rules , a set of rules which you have yet to provide the origin of .<-->O
I m curious as to who is the bearer of these rules seeing as the government doesn t have any control of what people do .<-->N
Silas The bearers of these rules are the people .<-->N
Contrary to what you may believe , people do not need constant surveillance of one another to co-exist .<-->O
People are perfectly capable of finding a set of principles to live by that protects not only themselves but the environment as well .<-->O
Wren -LRB- sarcasm -RRB- Yes , because religion has worked so well !<-->O
Whether it be God or government people are destine to be under the scrutiny of authoritarianism .<-->N
Please explain to me what happens when someone falls out of line against these set principles , or when a group s principles conflicts with another set of principles .<-->N
Silas Those who go against said principles should be punished .<-->N
Who doles punishment should be decided amongst the people themselves .<-->N
Authority or not , conflict is inevitable .<-->N
However these conflicts won t involve massive genocide or nuclear explosions .<-->N
I believe people are generally good , it s the environment we live in that turns us against one another .<-->O
Wren You talk as though people have all the answers ?<-->N
The origin of civilization didn t start with a skyscraper in the middle of the forest , it started with people and their primitive needs and insecurities , the need to establish dominion through fear and power .<-->O
People who put themselves first ultimately are the ones that lead to the destruction of everything else .<-->O
If you re looking for some thing to blame you won t find it .<-->N
Silas Our air is polluted with toxins and our water is polluted with waste from manufacturing .<-->N
There are people suffering everywhere and yet science is so far behind where it matters .<-->N
A satellite can be launched into orbit and bring back images millions of miles away but our water filled , with pharmaceuticals , can not properly be cleaned ?<-->N
Why on earth would cloning another living being come before finding cures for diseases !<-->N
I truly believe science to be a good thing but there is far too much depravity coming from it .<-->O
We re stuck finding cures for the ailments caused by technology and yet people latch on to technology , expecting it to solve all our problems .<-->N
Most haunting , society is becoming desensitized to all of it .<-->N
We are very close to stripping away what little humanity we have left and becoming robotic in nature , looking at everything in a scientific lens .<-->O
Society expects instant gratification and is consistently undervaluing the very things that make us humane .<-->O
As a whole we ve becoming needy , less principled , and incapable of doing things without relying on technology .<-->O
We re on the verge of becoming nothing more than sponges for gratification without purpose .<-->N
It s sickening .<-->N
Wren Much of what you ve stated I can agree with , yet I still think you re missing the point .<-->O
It s not science that s cloning people instead of purifying the water , its people .<-->N
Why is that occurring , I don t know .<-->N
Perhaps water filter companies want to stay in business .<-->N
It really doesn t matter what the excuse , it all links back to the very nature of people Silas None of that matters .<-->O
If science hadn t manifested itself it has , such catastrophic contingencies would not have been set into motion .<-->O
Wren And then I m sure you d have something else catastrophic to complain about .<-->O
Silas I suppose I would .<-->N
The Threat of Science CHRISTIAN LIVING IN AN AGE OF SCIENCE -LRB- 7 -RRB- We , who , in W. H. Auden s words , live in societies to which the study of that which can be weighed and measured is a consuming love , have difficulty imagining an alternative to our approach to reality .<-->O
Alfred W. Crosby , The Measure of Reality From early on men have been wary of science .<-->N
Concern about the threat of science to human wellbeing has been popularized in such books as Mary Shelley sFrankenstein , Aldous Huxley s Brave New World , George Orwell s 1984 , and Rachel Carson s Silent Spring , as well as in the films 2001 : A Space Odyssey , A Clockwork Orange , and Jurassic Park , among others .<-->O
Such books and films reflect widespread concern about the power of science for bringing evil to the world , whether knowingly or not .<-->O
But concerns about mad scientists and a world taken over by the very technology we create in order to master and improve the world are hardly the extent of the threat of science .<-->O
The real threat posed by the success of the scientific endeavor is more subtle and potentially more damaging .<-->O
In four ways the modern scientific enterprise threatens the wellbeing of society : the arrogance of knowing , the enhancing of human sin , the decline of morality , and the dehumanizing of man .<-->O
The work of science does not automatically or necessarily give rise to these evils .<-->N
However , in one way or another , they have all been present in the scientific enterprise , and are present still today .<-->N
In this installment I want to examine each of these threats briefly .<-->N
The arrogance of science The first of these , the arrogance of the scientific community , is a direct offshoot of its amazing success .<-->O
With the success of science have come technological innovation , increased standards of living , and economic prosperity such as the world has never seen before not to mention more private and government support for the work of science .<-->O
And , with success and prosperity , a certain arrogance has crept into man s view of himself and what he is able to do through science and technology .<-->O
This is particularly evident in our day when certain groups are labeled as anti-science , meaning that they dare to oppose the hegemony of the scientific community when it comes to looming social issues .<-->O
We can observe this arrogance in public debates over the factuality of evolution , the legitimacy of stem-cell research and other bioethical projects , and the claims about climate change .<-->N
For the most part , the secular scientific community has settled its opinions on each of these matters .<-->N
Any who still believe the jury to be out on whether evolution presents a reliable cosmogony or cosmology , human embryos are legitimate objects of research , or humans are responsible for climate change if indeed such change exists are branded as know-nothings and worse .<-->O
The Scriptures warn against the arrogance that can attend to knowledge -LRB- cf. 1 Cor .<-->O
8:1 -RRB- .<-->N
The fact that , over the centuries , aspects of the scientific paradigm , once considered to be unshakeable , have been altered or revised significantly , should counsel more openness on the part of scientists to dialog with and persuade or be persuaded by those who disagree with their views .<-->O
Yet members of the scientific community can be quick to condemn positions which disagree with their own .<-->O
This was seen in the denunciatory response of researchers and business interests to the recent decision of the European Court to deny patents for products of human stem-cell research .<-->N
It can also be seen in the general harrumphing and pooh-poohing of the reports about neutrinos which might travel faster than the speed of light .<-->O
But mostly the arrogance of certain members of the scientific community is aimed at religious and political opponents who are not yet persuaded of the complete reliability of the standard secular science paradigm .<-->O
Such arrogance shuts down dialog , divides societies , and unfairly condemns other potentially viable points of view .<-->O
In the process , it also bolsters the public view of the authority of science at the expense of every other way of knowing .<-->O
Enhancing human sin The second threat that science poses to society is in its ability to enhance mankind s sinfulness .<-->O
By himself , sinful man is plenty bad enough , as we see in numerous examples from everyday life .<-->O
Add scientific know-how and technology on a society-wide scale , and you have the potential for a dramatic enhancement of man s sinfulness .<-->O
God Himself expressed concern over the way technology had enhanced humankind s ability to offend against the divine order in the story of the Tower of Babel : And the LORD said , Behold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is only the beginning of what they will do .<-->O
And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them -LRB- Gen. 11:6 -RRB- In the middle of the twentieth century , Germany was the most scientifically advanced society in the world .<-->O
The hubris of its leaders led them to exploit science and technology to the destruction of peoples and cultures on a scale never before seen .<-->O
In the same way , the resources produced by science and technology , in the hands of terrorists , have caused the deaths of thousands of innocent people , and the techniques of abortion have made the slaughter of millions of unborn infants a procedure as easy and as commonplace as filling a tooth .<-->O
The ability of science and technology to enhance man s ability to sin against his fellow man is clear enough .<-->O
What is needed are ways of ensuring that the scientific enterprise works within parameters and according to standards that can help to keep this threat from materializing .<-->N
Reinforcing lower moral standards The third threat of modern science relates to morality .<-->O
Once science and technology have begun to be used for questionably moral purposes , the effect can be to standardize what were previously regarded as immoral practices , thus lowering the bar of morality and , in the process , endangering the wellbeing of society .<-->O
For example , once politics made it possible for abortion to be legal , science made it possible for it to be relatively easy and inexpensive .<-->O
Thus , sanctioned by the medical community and enhanced by new technologies , abortion became , for many Americans , an acceptable moral option in the face of an unwanted pregnancy .<-->O
The effect of this has been besides the slaughter of 60 million unborn children to spur scientists on to discover new ways of making abortion easier such as the so-called night-after pill and thus to reinforce the idea of its acceptability by making it even more convenient and private .<-->O
Another way that science adversely affects morals is by its practice of quantification .<-->N
For science to do its work , everything it chooses to study must be reduced to numbers in some way .<-->N
Numbers can be observed , manipulated , altered , measured , and tallied .<-->N
When the numbers of science combine with the numbers from economics , new products or procedures can be achieved which have as their only concern some variation of the bottom line .<-->N
When these numbers work , all kinds of other concerns moral concerns can be conveniently overlooked , denied , or redefined : effects on the environment , harmful byproducts and side-effects , or long-term residual effects .<-->O
Think : DDT , Love Canal , thalidomide , the tobacco industry .<-->N
Once doing science by the numbers becomes the norm in order to maximize efficiencies or returns on investment other ethical and moral questions are either downplayed or ignored .<-->O
Dehumanization The final threat of modern science is that of dehumanization .<-->O
Many of our contemporaries have begun to be plagued by feelings of alienation , impersonalization , meaninglessness , and hopelessness .<-->O
These feelings coincide interestingly with the rise of science and technology and the widespread materialism these endeavors fuel .<-->N
Social science turns people into statistics .<-->N
Science in general , with its emphasis on a naturalistic worldview , can deny the validity and vitality of meaningful spiritual experience , creating a social environment in which spirituality is merely an option at best , a crutch at worst .<-->O
At present , certain members of the neuroscientific community are even beginning to explain that human beings do not possess free will , are not ultimately responsible for their actions , and so must be held accountable in different ways , not excluding repairing brains that may be regarded as not functioning properly for adequate socialization .<-->O
The film , One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest captured the essence of this threat and brilliantly demonstrated the power of science to change human behavior in degrading and dehumanizing ways .<-->O
I do not mean to suggest that these threats are always present in the work of science , or that they are somehow inescapable .<-->O
They are real , and they must be borne in mind by any society which has elevated science to the status of final arbiter of all things truthful .<-->O
Unless sufficient checks and balances are built into the work of science , the scientific community will have no reason not to continue pursuing everything it can think to do , regardless of the threat their work may present .<-->O
And in such an unchecked and unbridled environment , the threats posed by the success of the scientific endeavor can most assuredly be expected to materialize and increase .<-->O
For reflection or discussion 1 .<-->N
Have you witnessed any of these threats which accompany the success of the scientific enterprise ?<-->N
How much do you know about the ways science regulates its work ?<-->N
Do you know any scientists you might ask ?<-->O
Reflect on the four threats of science : Do the Scriptures provide any counsel for beginning to construct a defense against these threats ?<-->O
Give some examples .<-->N
Suggest some ways that Christians might do a better job of keeping abreast of developments within the scientific community .<-->O
Why would it be important that at least some of us are doing this ?<-->O
How should Christians respond to the charge that we are anti-science ?<-->N
Science Is Not Your Enemy he great thinkers of the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment were scientists .<-->N
Not only did many of them contribute to mathematics , physics , and physiology , but all of them were avid theorists in the sciences of human nature .<-->N
They were cognitive neuroscientists , who tried to explain thought and emotion in terms of physical mechanisms of the nervous system .<-->O
They were evolutionary psychologists , who speculated on life in a state of nature and on animal instincts that are infused into our bosoms .<-->N
And they were social psychologists , who wrote of the moral sentiments that draw us together , the selfish passions that inflame us , and the foibles of shortsightedness that frustrate our best-laid plans .<-->O
These thinkers Descartes , Spinoza , Hobbes , Locke , Hume , Rousseau , Leibniz , Kant , Smith are all the more remarkable for having crafted their ideas in the absence of formal theory and empirical data .<-->N
The mathematical theories of information , computation , and games had yet to be invented .<-->N
The words neuron , hormone , and gene meant nothing to them .<-->N
When reading these thinkers , I often long to travel back in time and offer them some bit of twenty-first-century freshman science that would fill a gap in their arguments or guide them around a stumbling block .<-->O
What would these Fausts have given for such knowledge ?<-->O
What could they have done with it ?<-->N
WATCH : Leon Wieseltier 's rejoinder : Science does n't have all the answers We don t have to fantasize about this scenario , because we are living it .<-->N
We have the works of the great thinkers and their heirs , and we have scientific knowledge they could not have dreamed of .<-->O
This is an extraordinary time for the understanding of the human condition .<-->N
Intellectual problems from antiquity are being illuminated by insights from the sciences of mind , brain , genes , and evolution .<-->O
Powerful tools have been developed to explore them , from genetically engineered neurons that can be controlled with pinpoints of light to the mining of big data as a means of understanding how ideas propagate .<-->O
One would think that writers in the humanities would be delighted and energized by the efflorescence of new ideas from the sciences .<-->O
But one would be wrong .<-->N
Though everyone endorses science when it can cure disease , monitor the environment , or bash political opponents , the intrusion of science into the territories of the humanities has been deeply resented .<-->O
Just as reviled is the application of scientific reasoning to religion ; many writers without a trace of a belief in God maintain that there is something unseemly about scientists weighing in on the biggest questions .<-->O
In the major journals of opinion , scientific carpetbaggers are regularly accused of determinism , reductionism , essentialism , positivism , and worst of all , something called scientism .<-->O
The past couple years have seen fourdenunciations of scientism in this magazine alone , together with attacks inBookforum , The Claremont Review of Books , The Huffington Post , The Nation , National Review Online , The New Atlantis , The New York Times , and Standpoint .<-->N
The eclectic politics of these publications reflects the bipartisan nature of the resentment .<-->O
This passage , from a 2011 review in The Nation of three books by Sam Harris by the historian Jackson Lears , makes the standard case for the prosecution by the left : Positivist assumptions provided the epistemological foundations for Social Darwinism and pop-evolutionary notions of progress , as well as for scientific racism and imperialism .<-->O
These tendencies coalesced in eugenics , the doctrine that human well-being could be improved and eventually perfected through the selective breeding of the `` fit '' and the sterilization or elimination of the `` unfit . ''<-->O
... Every schoolkid knows about what happened next : the catastrophic twentieth century .<-->N
Two world wars , the systematic slaughter of innocents on an unprecedented scale , the proliferation of unimaginable destructive weapons , brushfire wars on the periphery of empire all these events involved , in various degrees , the application of sceintific research to advanced technology .<-->O
The case from the right , captured in this 2007 speech from Leon Kass , George W. Bush s bioethics adviser , is just as measured : Scientific ideas and discoveries about living nature and man , perfectly welcome and harmless in themselves , are being enlisted to do battle against our traditional religious and moral teachings , and even our self-understanding as creatures with freedom and dignity .<-->O
A quasi-religious faith has sprung up among us let me call it `` soul-less scientism '' which believes that our new biology , eliminating all mystery , can give a complete account of human life , giving purely scientific explanations of human thought , love , creativity , moral judgment , and even why we believe in God .<-->O
... Make no mistake .<-->N
The stakes in this contest are high : at issue are the moral and spiritual health of our nation , the continued vitality of science , and our own self-understanding as human beings and as children of the West .<-->O
These are zealous prosecutors indeed .<-->O
But their cases are weak .<-->N
The mindset of science can not be blamed for genocide and war and does not threaten the moral and spiritual health of our nation .<-->O
It is , rather , indispensable in all areas of human concern , including politics , the arts , and the search for meaning , purpose , and morality .<-->O
The term scientism is anything but clear , more of a boo-word than a label for any coherent doctrine .<-->N
Sometimes it is equated with lunatic positions , such as that science is all that matters or that scientists should be entrusted to solve all problems .<-->O
Sometimes it is clarified with adjectives like simplistic , na ve , and vulgar .<-->O
The definitional vacuum allows me to replicate gay activists flaunting of queer and appropriate the pejorative for a position I am prepared to defend .<-->O
Scientism , in this good sense , is not the belief that members of the occupational guild called science are particularly wise or noble .<-->O
On the contrary , the defining practices of science , including open debate , peer review , and double-blind methods , are explicitly designed to circumvent the errors and sins to which scientists , being human , are vulnerable .<-->O
Scientism does not mean that all current scientific hypotheses are true ; most new ones are not , since the cycle of conjecture and refutation is the lifeblood of science .<-->O
It is not an imperialistic drive to occupy the humanities ; the promise of science is to enrich and diversify the intellectual tools of humanistic scholarship , not to obliterate them .<-->O
And it is not the dogma that physical stuff is the only thing that exists .<-->N
Scientists themselves are immersed in the ethereal medium of information , including the truths of mathematics , the logic of their theories , and the values that guide their enterprise .<-->N
In this conception , science is of a piece with philosophy , reason , and Enlightenment humanism .<-->N
It is distinguished by an explicit commitment to two ideals , and it is these that scientism seeks to export to the rest of intellectual lifeThe first is that the world isintelligible .<-->O
The phenomena we experience may be explained by principles that are more general than the phenomena themselves .<-->N
These principles may in turn be explained by more fundamental principles , and so on .<-->N
In making sense of our world , there should be few occasions in which we are forced to concede It just is or It s magic or Because I said so .<-->O
The commitment to intelligibility is not a matter of brute faith , but gradually validates itself as more and more of the world becomes explicable in scientific terms .<-->O
The processes of life , for example , used to be attributed to a mysterious lan vital ; now we know they are powered by chemical and physical reactions among complex molecules .<-->O
Demonizers of scientism often confuse intelligibility with a sin called reductionism .<-->O
But to explain a complex happening in terms of deeper principles is not to discard its richness .<-->N
No sane thinker would try to explain World War I in the language of physics , chemistry , and biology as opposed to the more perspicuous language of the perceptions and goals of leaders in 1914 Europe .<-->O
At the same time , a curious person can legitimately ask why human minds are apt to have such perceptions and goals , including the tribalism , overconfidence , and sense of honor that fell into a deadly combination at that historical moment .<-->O
Many of our cultural institutions cultivate a philistine indifference to science .<-->N
The second ideal is that the acquisition of knowledge is hard .<-->O
The world does not go out of its way to reveal its workings , and even if it did , our minds are prone to illusions , fallacies , and super - stitions .<-->O
Most of the traditional causes of belief faith , revelation , dogma , authority , charisma , conventional wisdom , the invigorating glow of subjective certainty are generators of error and should be dismissed as sources of knowledge .<-->O
To understand the world , we must cultivate work-arounds for our cognitive limitations , including skepticism , open debate , formal precision , and empirical tests , often requiring feats of ingenuity .<-->O
Any movement that calls itself scientific but fails to nurture opportunities for the falsification of its own beliefs -LRB- most obviously when it murders or imprisons the people who disagree with it -RRB- is not a scientific movement .<-->O
In which ways , then , does science illuminate human affairs ?<-->N
Let me start with the most ambitious : the deepest questions about who we are , where we came from , and how we define the meaning and purpose of our lives .<-->N
This is the traditional territory of religion , and its defenders tend to be the most excitable critics of scientism .<-->O
They are apt to endorse the partition plan proposed by Stephen Jay Gould in his worstbook , Rocks of Ages , according to which the proper concerns of science and religion belong to non-overlapping magisteria .<-->O
Science gets the empirical universe ; religion gets the questions of moral meaning and value .<-->N
Unfortunately , this entente unravels as soon as you begin to examine it .<-->N
The moral worldview of any scientifically literate person one who is not blinkered by fundamentalism requires a radical break from religious conceptions of meaning and value .<-->O
To begin with , the findings of science entail that the belief systems of all the world s traditional religions and cultures their theories of the origins of life , humans , and societies are factually mistaken .<-->O
We know , but our ancestors did not , that humans belong to a single species of African primate that developed agriculture , government , and writing late in its history .<-->N
We know that our species is a tiny twig of a genealogical tree that embraces all living things and that emerged from prebiotic chemicals almost four billion years ago .<-->N
We know that we live on a planet that revolves around one of a hundred billion stars in our galaxy , which is one of a hundred billion galaxies in a 13.8-billion-year-old universe , possibly one of a vast number of universes .<-->O
We know that our intuitions about space , time , matter , and causation are incommensurable with the nature of reality on scales that are very large and very small .<-->O
We know that the laws governing the physical world -LRB- including accidents , disease , and other misfortunes -RRB- have no goals that pertain to human well-being .<-->O
There is no such thing as fate , providence , karma , spells , curses , augury , divine retribution , or answered prayers though the discrepancy between the laws of probability and the workings of cognition may explain why people believe there are .<-->O
And we know that we did not always know these things , that the beloved convictions of every time and culture may be decisively falsified , doubtless including some we hold today .<-->O
In other words , the worldview that guides the moral and spiritual values of an educated person today is the worldview given to us by science .<-->O
Though the scientific facts do not by themselves dictate values , they certainly hem in the possibilities .<-->O
By stripping ecclesiastical authority of its credibility on factual matters , they cast doubt on its claims to certitude in matters of morality .<-->O
The scientific refutation of the theory of vengeful gods and occult forces undermines practices such as human sacrifice , witch hunts , faith healing , trial by ordeal , and the persecution of heretics .<-->O
The facts of science , by exposing the absence of purpose in the laws governing the universe , force us to take responsibility for the welfare of ourselves , our species , and our planet .<-->O
For the same reason , they undercut any moral or political system based on mystical forces , quests , destinies , dialectics , struggles , or messianic ages .<-->O
And in combination with a few unexceptionable convictions that all of us value our own welfare and that we are social beings who impinge on each other and can negotiate codes of conduct the scientific facts militate toward a defensible morality , namely adhering to principles that maximize the flourishing of humans and other sentient beings .<-->O
This humanism , which is inextricable from a scientific understanding of the world , is becoming the de facto morality of modern democracies , international organizations , and liberalizing religions , and its unfulfilled promises define the moral imperatives we face today .<-->O
Moreover , science has contributed directly and enormously to the fulfillment of these values .<-->O
If one were to list the proudest accomplishments of our species -LRB- setting aside the removal of obstacles we set in our own path , such as the abolition of slavery and the defeat of fascism -RRB- , many would be gifts bestowed by science .<-->O
The most obvious is the exhilarating achievement of scientific knowledge itself .<-->O
We can say much about the history of the universe , the forces that make it tick , the stuff we re made of , the origin of living things , and the machinery of life , including our own mental life .<-->N
Better still , this understanding consists not in a mere listing of facts , but in deep and elegant principles , like the insight that life depends on a molecule that carries information , directs metabolism , and replicates itself .<-->O
Science has also provided the world with images of sublime beauty : stroboscopically frozen motion , exotic organisms , distant galaxies and outer planets , fluorescing neural circuitry , and a luminous planet Earth rising above the moon s horizon into the blackness of space .<-->O
Like great works of art , these are not just pretty pictures but prods to contemplation , which deepen our understanding of what it means to be human and of our place in nature .<-->O
And contrary to the widespread canard that technology has created a dystopia of deprivation and violence , every global measure of human flourishing is on the rise .<-->O
The numbers show that after millennia of near-universal poverty , a steadily growing proportion of humanity is surviving the first year of life , going to school , voting in democracies , living in peace , communicating on cell phones , enjoying small luxuries , and surviving to old age .<-->O
The Green Revolution in agronomy alone saved a billion people from starvation .<-->N
And if you want examples of true moral greatness , go to Wikipedia and look up the entries for smallpox and rinderpest -LRB- cattle plague -RRB- .<-->O
The definitions are in the past tense , indicating that human ingenuity has eradicated two of the cruelest causes of suffering in the history of our kind .<-->O
Though science is beneficially embedded in our material , moral , and intellectual lives , many of our cultural institutions , including the liberal arts programs of many universities , cultivate a philistine indifference to science that shades into contempt .<-->O
Students can graduate from elite colleges with a trifling exposure to science .<-->N
They are commonly misinformed that scientists no longer care about truth but merely chase the fashions of shifting paradigms .<-->O
A demonization campaign anachronistically impugns science for crimes that are as old as civilization , including racism , slavery , conquest , and genocide .<-->O
Just as common , and as historically illiterate , is the blaming of science for political movements with a pseudoscientific patina , particularly Social Darwinism and eugenics .<-->N
Social Darwinism was the misnamed laissez-faire philosophy of Herbert Spencer .<-->N
It was inspired not by Darwin s theory of natural selection , but by Spencer s Victorian-era conception of a mysterious natural force for progress , which was best left unimpeded .<-->O
Today the term is often used to smear any application of evolution to the understanding of human beings .<-->N
Eugenics was the campaign , popular among leftists and progressives in the early decades of the twentieth century , for the ultimate form of social progress , improving the genetic stock of humanity .<-->O
Today the term is commonly used to assail behavioral genetics , the study of the genetic contributions to individual differences .<-->N
I can testify that this recrimination is not a relic of the 1990s science wars .<-->N
When Harvard reformed its general education requirement in 2006 to 2007 , the preliminary task force report introduced the teaching of science without any mention of its place in human knowledge : Science and technology directly affect our students in many ways , both positive and negative : they have led to life-saving medicines , the internet , more efficient energy storage , and digital entertainment ; they also have shepherded nuclear weapons , biological warfare agents , electronic eavesdropping , and damage to the environment .<-->O
This strange equivocation between the utilitarian and the nefarious was not applied to other disciplines .<-->O
-LRB- Just imagine motivating the study of classical music by noting that it both generates economic activity and inspired the Nazis . -RRB-<-->N
And there was no acknowledgment that we might have good reasons to prefer science and know-how over ignorance and superstition .<-->O
At a 2011 conference , another colleague summed up what she thought was the mixed legacy of science : the eradication of smallpox on the one hand ; the Tuskegee syphilis study on the other .<-->N
-LRB- In that study , another bloody shirt in the standard narrative about the evils of science , public-health researchers beginning in 1932 tracked the progression of untreated , latent syphilis in a sample of impoverished African Americans . -RRB-<-->O
The comparison is obtuse .<-->N
It assumes that the study was the unavoidable dark side of scientific progress as opposed to a universally deplored breach , and it compares a one-time failure to prevent harm to a few dozen people with the prevention of hundreds of millions of deaths per century , in perpetuity .<-->O
Amajor goad for the recent denunciations of scientism has been the application of neuroscience , evolution , and genetics to human affairs .<-->O
Certainly many of these applications are glib or wrong , and they are fair game for criticism : scanning the brains of voters as they look at politicians faces , attributing war to a gene for aggression , explaining religion as an evolutionary adaptation to bond the group .<-->O
Yet it s not unheard of for intellectuals who are innocent of science to advance ideas that are glib or wrong , and no one is calling for humanities scholars to go back to their carrels and stay out of discussions of things that matter .<-->O
It is a mistake to use a few wrongheaded examples as an excuse to quarantine the sciences of human nature from our attempt to understand the human condition .<-->O
To simplify is not to be simplistic .<-->N
Take our understanding of politics .<-->N
What is government itself , asked James Madison , but the greatest of all reflections on human nature ?<-->N
The new sciences of the mind are reexamining the connections between politics and human nature , which were avidly discussed in Madison s time but submerged during a long interlude in which humans were assumed to be blank slates or rational actors .<-->O
Humans , we are increasingly appreciating , are moralistic actors , guided by norms and taboos about authority , tribe , and purity , and driven by conflicting inclinations toward revenge and reconciliation .<-->O
These impulses ordinarily operate beneath our conscious awareness , but in some circumstances they can be turned around by reason and debate .<-->O
We are starting to grasp why these moralistic impulses evolved ; how they are implemented in the brain ; how they differ among individuals , cultures , and sub - cultures ; and which conditions turn them on and off .<-->N
The application of science to politics not only enriches our stock of ideas , but also offers the means to ascertain which of them are likely to be correct .<-->N
Political debates have traditionally been deliberated through case studies , rhetoric , and what software engineers call HiPPO -LRB- highest-paid person s opinion -RRB- .<-->N
Not surprisingly , the controversies have careened without resolution .<-->N
Do democracies fight each other ?<-->N
What about trading partners ?<-->N
Do neighboring ethnic groups inevitably play out ancient hatreds in bloody conflict ?<-->O
Do peacekeeping forces really keep the peace ?<-->N
Do terrorist organizations get what they want ?<-->N
How about Gandhian nonviolent movements ?<-->N
Are post-conflict reconciliation rituals effective at preventing the renewal of conflict ?<-->O
History nerds can adduce examples that support either answer , but that does not mean the questions are irresolvable .<-->O
Political events are buffeted by many forces , so it s possible that a given force is potent in general but submerged in a particular instance .<-->O
With the advent of data science the analysis of large , open-access data sets of numbers or text signals can be extracted from the noise and debates in history and political science resolved more objectively .<-->O
As best we can tell at present , the answers to the questions listed above are -LRB- on average , and all things being equal -RRB- no , no , no , yes , no , yes , and yes .<-->O
The humanities are the domain in which the intrusion of science has produced the strongest recoil .<-->N
Yet it is just that domain that would seem to be most in need of an infusion of new ideas .<-->O
By most accounts , the humanities are in trouble .<-->O
University programs are downsizing , the next generation of scholars is un - or underemployed , morale is sinking , students are staying away in droves .<-->N
No thinking person should be indifferent to our society s disinvestment from the humanities , which are indispensable to a civilized democracy .<-->O
Diagnoses of the malaise of the humanities rightly point to anti-intellectual trends in our culture and to the commercialization of our universities .<-->O
But an honest appraisal would have to acknowledge that some of the damage is self-inflicted .<-->O
The humanities have yet to recover from the disaster of postmodernism , with its defiant obscurantism , dogmatic relativism , and suffocating political correctness .<-->O
And they have failed to define a progressive agenda .<-->N
Several university presidents and provosts have lamented to me that when a scientist comes into their office , it s to announce some exciting new research opportunity and demand the resources to pursue it .<-->O
When a humanities scholar drops by , it s to plead for respect for the way things have always been done .<-->O
Those ways do deserve respect , and there can be no replacement for the varieties of close reading , thick description , and deep immersion that erudite scholars can apply to individual works .<-->O
But must these be the only paths to understanding ?<-->N
A consilience with science offers the humanities countless possibilities for innovation in understanding .<-->N
Art , culture , and society are products of human brains .<-->N
They originate in our faculties of perception , thought , and emotion , and they cumulate and spread through the epidemiological dynamics by which one person affects others .<-->N
Shouldn t we be curious to understand these connections ?<-->O
Both sides would win .<-->N
The humanities would enjoy more of the explanatory depth of the sciences , to say nothing of the kind of a progressive agenda that appeals to deans and donors .<-->O
The sciences could challenge their theories with the natural experiments and ecologically valid phenomena that have been so richly characterized by humanists .<-->O
In some disciplines , this consilience is a fait accompli .<-->N
Archeology has grown from a branch of art history to a high-tech science .<-->F
Linguistics and the philosophy of mind shade into cognitive science and neuroscience .<-->N
READ : The argument continues : Pinker and Wieseltier , Science vs. Humanities , Round III Similar opportunities are there for the exploring .<-->N
The visual arts could avail themselves of the explosion of knowledge in vision science , including the perception of color , shape , texture , and lighting , and the evolutionary aesthetics of faces and landscapes .<-->N
Music scholars have much to discuss with the scientists who study the perception of speech and the brain s analysis of the auditory world .<-->N
As for literary scholarship , where to begin ?<-->N
John Dryden wrote that a work of fiction is a just and lively image of human nature , representing its passions and humours , and the changes of fortune to which it is subject , for the delight and instruction of mankind .<-->O
Linguistics can illuminate the resources of grammar and discourse that allow authors to manipulate a reader s imaginary experience .<-->O
Cognitive psychology can provide insight about readers ability to reconcile their own consciousness with those of the author and characters .<-->O
Behavioral genetics can update folk theories of parental influence with discoveries about the effects of genes , peers , and chance , which have profound implications for the interpretation of biography and memoir an endeavor that also has much to learn from the cognitive psychology of memory and the social psychology of self-presentation .<-->O
Evolutionary psychologists can distinguish the obsessions that are universal from those that are exaggerated by a particular culture and can lay out the inherent conflicts and confluences of interest within families , couples , friendships , and rivalries that are the drivers of plot .<-->O
And as with politics , the advent of data science applied to books , periodicals , correspondence , and musical scores holds the promise for an expansive new digital humanities .<-->O
The possibilities for theory and discovery are limited only by the imagination and include the origin and spread of ideas , networks of intellectual and artistic influence , the persistence of historical memory , the waxing and waning of themes in literature , and patterns of unofficial censorship and taboo .<-->O
Nonetheless , many humanities scholars have reacted to these opportunities like the protagonist of the grammar-book example of the volitional future tense : I will drown ; no one shall save me .<-->O
Noting that these analyses flatten the richness of individual works , they reach for the usual adjectives : simplistic , reductionist , na ve , vulgar , and of course , scientistic .<-->O
The complaint about simplification is misbegotten .<-->O
To explain something is to subsume it under more general principles , which always entails a degree of simplification .<-->N
Yet to simplify is not to be simplistic .<-->N
An appreciation of the particulars of a work can co-exist with explanations at many other levels , from the personality of an author to the cultural milieu , the faculties of human nature , and the laws governing social beings .<-->O
The rejection of a search for general trends and principles calls to mind Jorge Luis Borges s fictitious empire in which the Cartographers Guild drew a map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire , coinciding point for point with it .<-->O
The following Generations ... saw the vast Map to be Useless and permitted it to decay and fray under the Sun and winters .<-->N
And the critics should be careful with the adjectives .<-->O
If anything is na ve and simplistic , it is the conviction that the legacy silos of academia should be fortified and that we should be forever content with current ways of making sense of the world .<-->O
Surely our conceptions of politics , culture , and morality have much to learn from our best understanding of the physical universe and of our makeup as a species .<-->O
Science : Beneficial or Threat to Humanity ?<-->N
ON THE DAWN OF THE 21ST CENTURY , science has transcended the boarders of human understanding and expanded our knowledge of the things that were once unknown , making everything easier , faster , lighter and better .<-->O
Scientific studies about human have given a huge progress for Medicine and Surgery ; diseases that were once incurable are now easily cured , and even changing parts of our body is made possible .<-->O
The modern facilities of communication have made contact between people who are miles apart be easily patched within seconds .<-->N
The mechanization of Agriculture and Industry had made production easier , faster , and more comfortable .<-->N
Modern transportation has made the world closer , nearer and reachable .<-->N
From the burst of the engine we find ourselves easily getting to our destination at ease , not to mention the entertainment we have while we are on our way .<-->N
The raw power gathered from the earth are now used to make the machines function .<-->N
On the other hand , we should never forget science s most powerful and feared arsenals ; the Atomic , Chemical , Biological , Radiological and Nuclear weapons .<-->O
These weapons of mass destruction that are still idly waiting to be used will one day easily destroy everything and anything in the biosphere , including us .<-->O
Yes , science may have had shown capabilities of healing and creating but equally evident is its capacity for mass killing and destroying .<-->N
For now we are safe , but for how long ?<-->N

You may use either English or Filipino .<-->F
Science is a threat to Humanity .<-->N
Do you agree ??<-->N
The definition of science is the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior in the physical and natural .<-->O
Science is present from the early beginnings of mankind , even in the stone age when man creates fire to see in the dark and ward off the beasts of the night .<-->N
It did not take long for man to also develop catapults and spears which eventually led them to fighting one another for dominance over land and women .<-->N
Of course , the world we live in now has much advanced science and is civilized , countries signing peace treaties and using the same science technology to build weapons which are claimed by world leaders to be used only for defensive purposes .<-->O
But has these measures ensured the safety of humanity , or has it further proved that science is a threat to humanity ?<-->O
If science is truly a threat , will getting rid of science do man any good ?<-->O
We can not deny the existence of science , nor the potential shortcomings which it can bring .<-->O
No matter what era or environment we live in , man will still in one way or another pursue knowledge and create conveniences for their needs and wants .<-->O
By eradicating science , will humanity be safe ?<-->O
When science gives mankind knowledge of important subjects like death , the first thing man would do will try to counter the potential problems or threats .<-->O
Without proper knowledge and science , mankind would not have progressed to the stages of civilization and order .<-->O
In the era where different Chinese factions wage war to gain authority and land , a certain leader CaoCao had been experiencing severe headaches and had the legendary doctor HuaTuo to treat him .<-->O
With the skills and knowledge , HuaTuo concluded that he had to cut open CaoCao s head in order to operate surgery .<-->O
CaoCao was afraid that HuaTuo was secretly plotting his death and thus executed Huatuo without having his headaches treated to .<-->O
While it may be true that science can lead to destruction , it is the neglecting of science that is more dangerous and a threat to humanity .<-->O
While science has no doubt progressed to the world we live in right now which is deemed as Utopia from people of the past , many of mankind now are instead considering a society of danger and violence due to science .<-->O
Science has created weapons that have never been imagined of , ranging from a small bullet that is strong enough to take down and elephant to a nuclear bomb which killed more than 150,000 in Hiroshima .<-->O
This number does not include the extent of the after-effects .<-->N
The only difference between the dangers of science compared to now is the amount of destruction it can cause .<-->N
Knowing the dangers science can cause , United Nations and countries took measures and agreed not to use the nuclear weapons ever again .<-->N
Although there may be countries that may not abide by the agreements , science that is consistently upgrading everyday will soon neutralise the dangers of nuclear weapons .<-->O
Considering the fact that many people fear the possible threats of humanity that science will bring , be it robots taking over the world or a gigantic bomb that would wipe off the face of humanity from earth , what they fail to see is that whenever a great power is created , another will surface to overpower it .<-->O
People always use past occurrences to give excuses on why science should be stopped , such as using the Fukushima incident as a reason to support their reason on why nuclear energy should be eradicated .<-->O
First of all , the reason why the Fukushima incident occurred was because of the earthquake , even if it was not a nuclear-powered plant , it could be something worse such as a coal factory and can have the potential to release unimaginable amounts of posionous gases .<-->O
Thus , even if nuclear energy was not used but a different source was used , the impact will be equally bad if not worse .<-->O
Many organisations have been developing different types of safe nuclear energy , and this includes Bill Gates collaborating with companies from China .<-->N
With developing science , the possible dangers of it will definitely be eradicated .<-->O
Science is a tool powerful enough to change the way we live , nevertheless does it possess power to threaten humanity .<-->O
However , science will also solve its own problems eventually .<-->N
Essay : Science is a threat to humanity -LRB- draft 1 -RRB- We constantly hear of new scientific discoveries in our everyday lives .<-->N
As human progresses , we constantly want our life to get more comfortable and the only way to do this is through science and technology .<-->N
With science getting more and more advanced , lives are made comfortable , however we become spoilt .<-->O
We want everything to be under our command and with the power of new age weapons , We end up harming each other .<-->N
We may be as greedy as our ancient forefathers , but with our capabilities we are definitely much more dangerous than them .<-->O
Therefore , I believe thst science is a threat to humanity as long as we are unable to use it responsibly and sensibly to its maximum potential .<-->O
FIrstly , there was the breakthrough in nanotechnology .<-->N
The latter refers to working with objects to its atomic level .<-->N
This advanced technology no doubt brings about great advantages human lives , such as reducing the size of energy storage devices however i believe the cons outweigh the pros .<-->O
Firstly , Though nanotechnology brings about great advancement in the fields of science , It may also cause mass poisoning .<-->N
This is because nanotechnology involves dealing with extremely small particles that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier .<-->O
If foreign particles are introduced to our brain , It may very well affect our well being and mental health .<-->O
This is a possible risk that may wipe out an entire population if a poisonous particle was released .<-->O
Secondly , with science comes the creation of nuclear weapons .<-->N
And with irresponsible leaders in power of such destructive weapons , our world is in danger .<-->O
Wars started will involve the usage of nuclear weapons , for example the most traditional of nuclear weapon the atomic bomb , can blow up the entire singapore in seconds .<-->O
This will cause mass homicide and the killing of many innocent people .<-->N
Lastly , I believe that science has brought aboout major environmental issues such as global warming .<-->O
Science has brought about the inventions of many machinery and factories to manufacture products .<-->N
These factories emit some really harmful gases that not only destroys our ozone layer , it also emit large amounts of greenhouse gases that will warm up the entire earth .<-->O
This eventually causes mass melting in the ice caps and mountains which will cause a rise in the sea level .<-->N
A rise in the sea level will cause floods and natural disasters that will affect humans once again .<-->O
In conclusion , I believe that Science is a threat to humanity .<-->O
Humans by nature is selfish .<-->N
We want more and the easy way to obtain it is through science and technology .<-->N
However , we constantly forget that there is a price to pay for such conveniece we recieve .<-->N
We harm the environment , we harm ourselves and this may lead to our end .<-->O
Therefore , I belive that science is the root of all evil and it threatens humanity .<-->N
Is science a threat to humanity ?<-->N
No , since there is no real definition to good humanity .<-->O
I mean , living in ignorance and not having Godly powers ... is that good ?<-->O
I mean , we have the power to give a fish some monkey testicles for eyes .<-->O
is n't that fuckin ' awesome ?<-->N
fuck humanity .<-->N
if it 's wrong to make testicle eyes on fish ... then i do n't want to be right .<-->O
2 points Look back in time a couple hundred years .<-->N
Since then the quality and length of our life has increased significantly .<-->N
If you live in a first world nation then you benefit from these advances the most .<-->O
For example : when was the last time you went a day without being able to eat ?<-->N
How long does it take you to travel thousands of miles ?<-->N
How quickly can you research information on a computer ?<-->N
All of these great advancements are thanks to science .<-->N
1 point It is true that science has brought many great advancements .<-->O
But because of these advancements humanity is ruined .<-->N
The world is in corruption because of science .<-->N
For example , the global warming which lead to the melting of Antarctica .<-->N
Hacking and cracking of information .<-->N
The invention of dangerous bombs like nuclear weapons and atomic bomb .<-->O
The viruses and the diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease .<-->O
These declines are started and caused by science and these type of situations will keep worsening by the minute as long as there is an existence called science .<-->O
1 point Science will save us in the future ... When we further develop in the future , space transportation would of already saved us before the sun dies off .<-->O
1 point Science is knowledge attained through studies and practice , and that Science itself coming from the Latin word `` Scientia '' which means `` Knowledge '' .<-->N
It is a double edged sword .<-->N
It helps save and improve our lives through vaccines and modern day technology but it can also be abused and cause great harm for e.g. the atomic bomb , chemical warfare , war planes , environmental damage , etc. .<-->O
Science is just discovery of what the Earth has and sees how it can be applied to make our lives convenient .<-->O
It is we use them .<-->N
Like a knife .<-->N
We can use it as cutlery and to prepare meals , or use it as a weapon and go on a rampage .<-->N
Science is not harming people , people are harming people .<-->N
Take the gun , for example .<-->N
If you summed up all the people who were killed by guns , it would n't even come close to the amount of people killed with rocks , sticks and bare hands before the invention of the gin .<-->O
While it 's true that the homicide rate is much lower in nations like Japan and England where gun control is practiced , the higher homicide rate in nations is a product of a proclaimed love affair with freedom as it is a result of high rates of gun ownership .<-->O
At any rate , the sciences behind the development of the gun like chemistry , ballistics Metallurgy , and basic physics were produced strictly as beneficial technologies .<-->O
Precautions taken due to science only occur when it falls into the hands of people who want to exploit it without understanding it , especially politicians and religious leaders .<-->O
To most people technology produced through science is judged by whether something works or it does n't .<-->N
A deeper understanding of science often goes hand in hand with a deeper understanding of the greater good .<-->O
Some people who are more interested in power than what is right view science as a mysterious tool that they can employ without understanding .<-->O
All they want to know is that it works not how it works .<-->O
Al Qaida says that `` Allah is great , '' but they do n't rely on Allah to kill their enemies , they rely on technology they do n't understand and do n't want to understand .<-->O
George Bush is another example of someone who does not understand science and does not want to understand science like he Misused Air Force One for RNC Events , and yet he is perfectly happy to use technology , produced by science to do , `` God 's will '' in Iraq .<-->O
That makes one wonder whether it is science that is a threat or whether it is humans themselves that are a threat to humanity .<-->O
The same explosive that is used to cut a road through the mountains to bring goods and services to isolated villages can also be used to make a bomb to kill people .<-->O
The same electricity that powers an MRI machine also powers the electric chair on death row .<-->N
There are obviously pros and cons to the development of science and technology but does that mean we overlook the benefits because the negatives are unacceptable in the eyes of humanity ?<-->O
How will be ever hope to contact other inhabitants in outer space ?<-->O
How will we ever find a cure to cancer ?<-->N
How will we ever develop an alternative energy source if we decide that science is a threat to humanity ?<-->O
Science has greatly increased the ability of people to communicate .<-->N
Telephones and email enable people on opposite sides of the world to stay in touch where before they would have had no possible way to do so .<-->O
The Internet allows people access to unlimited information .<-->N
Anything from sports scores to your online report card .<-->N
Any study of pre-industrial society will show that computer games appear to have taken the place previously held by violence .<-->O
Another plus point of modern telecommunication devices is that we can help people whenever , wherever and however we d like .<-->O
If a natural disaster occurs in a country , it will be all over the news , social networking sites because we as the public want to know what is going on in the world .<-->O
We can then help aid and cure those in need and those that are stranded .<-->O
50 years ago this was not available .<-->N
If a nation was struck down by a tsunami then its every man for himself because no one out there has any knowledge of what s happening therefore how can one come to rescue ?<-->O
Nowadays we can all make small donations and it will all fly to the people who need it .<-->O
From medicine and food to teddy bears and inspirational cards .<-->N
Medicine is one of the best types of scientific development .<-->N
In the past Cholera or the Plague were classified as epidemics by doctors .<-->N
Towns after towns would suffer from pain and illness .<-->O
Nowadays it s a common disease that one could recover within short period of time whereas before it was as serious as we consider Cancer today .<-->O
In the past life expectancy for most people were 54 !<-->N
Whereas nowadays it goes up to 84 years in some areas .<-->N
Modern medicines have more than doubled our life expectancy , and enabled children to be vaccinated against diseases which beforehand had ensured a massive rate of infant mortality .<-->N
I for one do not want to live in a place where anesthesia has still not been invented .<-->O
Reason why science is threatening to humanity is because humanity itself has conjured up ways to apply science destructively with or without intention .<-->O
If we blame science generally , we are merely saying that everyone is a threat to humanity just by existing .<-->O
Science is a tool and there will always be some that will misuse it .<-->O
If you would rather be sitting in a cave right now banging rocks on wood and thinking about going out and hunting down prey for your dinner , so be it .<-->O
You can not blame science , any more than you can blame a gun for shooting someone .<-->O
If science is truly a threat , will getting rid of science do man any good ?<-->O
THE FIVE BIGGEST THREATS TO HUMAN EXISTENCE In the daily hubbub of current crises facing humanity , we forget about the many generations we hope are yet to come .<-->O
Not those who will live 200 years from now , but 1,000 or 10,000 years from now .<-->N
I use the word hope because we face risks , called existential risks , that threaten to wipe out humanity .<-->O
These risks are not just for big disasters , but for the disasters that could end history .<-->O
Not everyone has ignored the long future though .<-->O
Mystics like Nostradamus have regularly tried to calculate the end of the world .<-->N
HG Wells tried to develop a science of forecasting and famously depicted the far future of humanity in his book The Time Machine .<-->N
Other writers built other long-term futures to warn , amuse or speculate .<-->N
But had these pioneers or futurologists not thought about humanity s future , it would not have changed the outcome .<-->O
There wasn t much that human beings in their place could have done to save us from an existential crisis or even cause one .<-->O
We are in a more privileged position today .<-->N
Human activity has been steadily shaping the future of our planet .<-->N
And even though we are far from controlling natural disasters , we are developing technologies that may help mitigate , or at least , deal with them .<-->O
Future imperfect Yet , these risks remain understudied .<-->N
There is a sense of powerlessness and fatalism about them .<-->N
People have been talking apocalypses for millennia , but few have tried to prevent them .<-->N
Humans are also bad at doing anything about problems that have not occurred yet -LRB- partially because of the availability heuristic the tendency to overestimate the probability of events we know examples of , and underestimate events we can not readily recall -RRB- .<-->O
If humanity becomes extinct , at the very least the loss is equivalent to the loss of all living individuals and the frustration of their goals .<-->O
But the loss would probably be far greater than that .<-->N
Human extinction means the loss of meaning generated by past generations , the lives of all future generations -LRB- and there could be an astronomical number of future lives -RRB- and all the value they might have been able to create .<-->O
If consciousness or intelligence are lost , it might mean that value itself becomes absent from the universe .<-->O
This is a huge moral reason to work hard to prevent existential threats from becoming reality .<-->O
And we must not fail even once in this pursuit .<-->O
With that in mind , I have selected what I consider the five biggest threats to humanity s existence .<-->O
But there are caveats that must be kept in mind , for this list is not final .<-->N
Over the past century we have discovered or created new existential risks supervolcanoes were discovered in the early 1970s , and before theManhattan project nuclear war was impossible so we should expect others to appear .<-->O
Also , some risks that look serious today might disappear as we learn more .<-->O
The probabilities also change over time sometimes because we are concerned about the risks and fix them .<-->N
Finally , just because something is possible and potentially hazardous , doesn t mean it is worth worrying about .<-->O
There are some risks we can not do anything at all about , such as gamma ray bursts that result from the explosions of galaxies .<-->N
But if we learn we can do something , the priorities change .<-->N
For instance , with sanitation , vaccines and antibiotics , pestilence went from an act of God to bad public health .<-->N
Nuclear war While only two nuclear weapons have been used in war so far at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II and nuclear stockpiles are down from their the peak they reached in the Cold War , it is a mistake to think that nuclear war is impossible .<-->O
In fact , it might not be improbable .<-->O
The Cuban Missile crisis was very close to turning nuclear .<-->O
If we assume one such event every 69 years and a one in three chance that it might go all the way to being nuclear war , the chance of such a catastrophe increases to about one in 200 per year .<-->O
Worse still , the Cuban Missile crisis was only the most well-known case .<-->O
The history of Soviet-US nuclear deterrence is full of close calls and dangerous mistakes .<-->O
The actual probability has changed depending on international tensions , but it seems implausible that the chances would be much lower than one in 1000 per year .<-->O
A full-scale nuclear war between major powers would kill hundreds of millions of people directly or through the near aftermath an unimaginable disaster .<-->O
But that is not enough to make it an existential risk .<-->N
Similarly the hazards of fallout are often exaggerated potentially deadly locally , but globally a relatively limited problem .<-->O
Cobalt bombs were proposed as a hypothetical doomsday weapon that would kill everybody with fallout , but are in practice hard and expensive to build .<-->O
And they are physically just barely possible .<-->O
The real threat is nuclear winter that is , soot lofted into the stratosphere causing a multi-year cooling and drying of the world .<-->N
Modern climate simulations show that it could preclude agriculture across much of the world for years .<-->O
If this scenario occurs billions would starve , leaving only scattered survivors that might be picked off by other threats such as disease .<-->O
The main uncertainty is how the soot would behave : depending on the kind of soot the outcomes may be very different , and we currently have no good ways of estimating this .<-->O
Bioengineered pandemic Natural pandemics have killed more people than wars .<-->N
However , natural pandemics are unlikely to be existential threats : there are usually some people resistant to the pathogen , and the offspring of survivors would be more resistant .<-->O
Evolution also does not favor parasites that wipe out their hosts , which is why syphilis went from a virulent killer to a chronic disease as it spread in Europe .<-->O
Unfortunately we can now make diseases nastier .<-->N
One of the more famous examples is how the introduction of an extra gene in mousepox the mouseversion of smallpox made it far more lethal and able to infect vaccinated individuals .<-->O
Recent work on bird flu has demonstrated that the contagiousness of a disease can be deliberately boosted .<-->N
Right now the risk of somebody deliberately releasing something devastating is low .<-->O
But as biotechnology gets better and cheaper , more groups will be able to make diseases worse .<-->O
Most work on bioweapons have been done by governments looking for something controllable , because wiping out humanity is not militarily useful .<-->O
But there are always some people who might want to do things because they can .<-->O
Others have higher purposes .<-->N
For instance , the Aum Shinrikyo cult tried to hasten the apocalypse using bioweapons beside their more successful nerve gas attack .<-->O
Some people think the Earth would be better off without humans , and so on .<-->O
The number of fatalities from bioweapon and epidemic outbreaks attacks looks like it has a power-law distribution most attacks have few victims , but a few kill many .<-->O
Given current numbers the risk of a global pandemic from bioterrorism seems very small .<-->N
But this is just bioterrorism : governments have killed far more people than terrorists with bioweapons -LRB- up to 400,000 may have died from the WWII Japanese biowar program -RRB- .<-->N
And as technology gets more powerful in the future nastier pathogens become easier to design .<-->N
Superintelligence Intelligence is very powerful .<-->N
A tiny increment in problem-solving ability and group coordination is why we left the other apes in the dust .<-->N
Now their continued existence depends on human decisions , not what they do .<-->N
Being smart is a real advantage for people and organisations , so there is much effort in figuring out ways of improving our individual and collective intelligence : from cognition-enhancing drugs to artificial-intelligence software .<-->O
The problem is that intelligent entities are good at achieving their goals , but if the goals are badly set they can use their power to cleverly achieve disastrous ends .<-->O
There is no reason to think that intelligence itself will make something behave nice and morally .<-->O
In fact , it is possible to prove that certain types of superintelligent systems would not obey moral rules even if they were true .<-->O
Even more worrying is that in trying to explain things to an artificial intelligence we run into profound practical and philosophical problems .<-->O
Human values are diffuse , complex things that we are not good at expressing , and even if we could do that we might not understand all the implications of what we wish for .<-->O
Software-based intelligence may very quickly go from below human to frighteningly powerful .<-->O
The reason is that it may scale in different ways from biological intelligence : it can run faster on faster computers , parts can be distributed on more computers , different versions tested and updated on the fly , new algorithms incorporated that give a jump in performance .<-->N
It has been proposed that an intelligence explosion is possible when software becomes good enough at making better software .<-->O
Should such a jump occur there would be a large difference in potential power between the smart system -LRB- or the people telling it what to do -RRB- and the rest of the world .<-->O
This has clear potential for disaster if the goals are badly set .<-->O
The unusual thing about superintelligence is that we do not know if rapid and powerful intelligence explosions are possible : maybe our current civilisation as a whole is improving itself at the fastest possible rate .<-->O
But there are good reasons to think that some technologies may speed things up far faster than current societies can handle .<-->N
Similarly we do not have a good grip on just how dangerous different forms of superintelligence would be , or what mitigation strategies would actually work .<-->O
It is very hard to reason about future technology we do not yet have , or intelligences greater than ourselves .<-->O
Of the risks on this list , this is the one most likely to either be massive or just a mirage .<-->O
This is a surprisingly under-researched area .<-->N
Even in the 50s and 60s when people were extremely confident that superintelligence could be achieved within a generation , they did not look much into safety issues .<-->O
Maybe they did not take their predictions seriously , but more likely is that they just saw it as a remote future problem .<-->O
Nanotechnology Nanotechnology is the control over matter with atomic or molecular precision .<-->N
That is in itself not dangerous instead , it would be very good news for most applications .<-->O
The problem is that , like biotechnology , increasing power also increases the potential for abuses that are hard to defend against .<-->O
The big problem is not the infamous grey goo of self-replicating nanomachines eating everything .<-->O
That would require clever design for this very purpose .<-->O
It is tough to make a machine replicate : biology is much better at it , by default .<-->O
Maybe some maniac would eventually succeed , but there are plenty of more low-hanging fruits on the destructive technology tree .<-->O
The most obvious risk is that atomically precise manufacturing looks ideal for rapid , cheap manufacturing of things like weapons .<-->O
In a world where any government could print large amounts of autonomous or semi-autonomous weapons -LRB- including facilities to make even more -RRB- arms races could become very fast and hence unstable , since doing a first strike before the enemy gets a too large advantage might be tempting .<-->O
Weapons can also be small , precision things : a smart poison that acts like a nerve gas but seeks out victims , or ubiquitous gnatbot surveillance systems for keeping populations obedient seems entirely possible .<-->O
Also , there might be ways of getting nuclear proliferation and climate engineering into the hands of anybody who wants it .<-->N
We can not judge the likelihood of existential risk from future nanotechnology , but it looks like it could be potentially disruptive just because it can give us whatever we wish for .<-->O
Unknown unknowns The most unsettling possibility is that there is something out there that is very deadly , and we have no clue about it .<-->O
The silence in the sky might be evidence for this .<-->N
Is the absence of aliens due to that life or intelligence is extremely rare , or that intelligent life tends to get wiped out ?<-->O
If there is a future Great Filter , it must have been noticed by other civilisations too , and even that didn t help .<-->O
Whatever the threat is , it would have to be something that is nearly unavoidable even when you know it is there , no matter who and what you are .<-->O
We do not know about any such threats -LRB- none of the others on this list work like this -RRB- , but they might exist .<-->O
Note that just because something is unknown it doesn t mean we can not reason about it .<-->O
In a remarkable paper Max Tegmark and Nick Bostrom show that a certain set of risks must be less than one chance in a billion per year , based on the relative age of Earth .<-->O
You might wonder why climate change or meteor impacts have been left off this list .<-->O
Climate change , no matter how scary , is unlikely to make the entire planet uninhabitable -LRB- but it could compound other threats if our defences to it break down -RRB- .<-->O
Meteors could certainly wipe us out , but we would have to be very unlucky .<-->O
The average mammalian species survives for about a million years .<-->N
Hence , the background natural extinction rate is roughly one in a million per year .<-->N
This is much lower than the nuclear-war risk , which after 70 years is still the biggest threat to our continued existence .<-->O
The availability heuristic makes us overestimate risks that are often in the media , and discount unprecedented risks .<-->N
If we want to be around in a million years we need to correct that .<-->O
C.S. Lewis on Science as a Threat to Freedom Among other things , C.S. Lewis considered modern science a threat to freedom in modern society .<-->O
In order to understand how modern science is a threat to freedom , we have to consider Lewis 's view of modern science .<-->O
Lewis lived at a time when science was emerging as the dominant system of thought in the Western world , when the technological spin-offs of that intellectual activity were fundamentally transforming every aspect of life .<-->O
Lewis reflected on this in his 1954 inaugural lecture at Cambridge University , when he declared : The sciences long remained like a lion-cub whose gambols delighted its master in private ; it had not yet tasted man 's blood .<-->O
All through the eighteenth century ... science was not the business of Man because Man had not yet become the business of science .<-->N
It dealt chiefly with the inanimate ; and it threw off few technological byproducts .<-->N
When Watt makes his engine , Darwin starts monkeying with the ancestry of Man , and Freud with his soul , then indeed the lion will have got out of its cage .1 As we know from the Narnia tales , a free lion does not pose a threat so long as it is true -- like Aslan .<-->O
But Lewis did not view science as a source of neutral truths about nature .<-->N
For example , in The Discarded Image , Lewis wrote about the differences between the medieval and modern model of nature : `` The most spectacular differences between the Medieval Model and our own concern astronomy and biology .<-->O
In both fields the new Model is supported by a wealth of empirical evidence .<-->N
But we should misrepresent the historical process if we said that the irruption of new facts was the sole cause of the alteration .<-->O
`` 2 According to Lewis , `` The old astronomy was not , in any exact sense , ` refuted ' by the telescope ... The new astronomy triumphed not because the cause for the old became desperate , but because the new was a better tool .<-->O
`` 3 The same was true of the revolution in biology `` from a devolutionary to an evolutionary scheme '' : `` This revolution was certainly not brought about by the discovery of new facts ... The demand for a developing world -- a demand obviously in harmony both with the revolutionary and the romantic temper -- grows up first ; when it is full grown the scientists go to work and discover the evidence .<-->O
`` 4 Lewis made similar comments about the development of Darwinian evolution in `` The Funeral of a Great Myth , '' where he concluded , `` every age gets , within certain limits , the science it desires .<-->N
`` 5 Lewis noted that he did `` not at all mean that these new phenomena are illusory , '' but he believed that `` nature has all sorts of phenomena in stock and can suit many different tastes .<-->O
`` 6 Viewing modern science as a reflection of its age , rather than a method for finding truth , does not necessarily transform it into a threat to freedom .<-->O
But Lewis 's dark foreboding about the direction of modern civilization inevitably cast a shadow over the sciences , which represent our civilization 's defining achievement .<-->O
Lewis was convinced that scientific authority would be used to justify and facilitate political oppression .<-->O
In That Hideous Strength , Lewis observed , `` The physical sciences , good and innocent in themselves , had already ... begun to be warped , and been subtly maneuvered in a certain direction .<-->O
Despair of objective truth had been increasingly insinuated into the scientists ; indifference to it , and a concentration upon mere power , had been the result .<-->O
`` 7For Lewis , the threat here is quite real .<-->O
Commenting on this book , which is so damning of modern science , Lewis later wrote , '' ` scientists ' as such are not the target ... what we are obviously up against throughout the story is not scientists but officials .<-->O
`` 8 This is an important distinction for Lewis .<-->N
Scientific planning is not necessarily evil , `` but ` Under modern conditions any effective invitation to hell will certainly appear in the guise of scientific planning ' -- as Hitler 's regime in fact did .<-->O
`` 9 Elaborating on this theme in his essay `` Is Progress Possible ?<-->N
, '' Lewis concluded that `` the new oligarchy must more and more base its claim to plan us on its claim of knowledge ... This means they must increasingly rely on the advice of scientists .<-->O
`` 10 LEFT OFF HERE Lewis added that he `` dread -LSB- ed -RSB- specialists in power because they are specialists speaking outside their special subjects .<-->O
Let scientists tell us about science .<-->N
But government involves questions about the good of man , and justice , and what things are worth having at what price ; and on these a scientific training gives a man 's opinion no added value . ''<-->O
This is why Lewis feared `` government in the name of science .<-->N
That is how tyrannies come in .<-->N
In every age the men who want us under their thumb , if they have any sense , will put forward the particular pretension which the hopes and fears of that age render most potent ... It has been magic , it has been Christianity .<-->O
Now it will certainly be science . ''<-->O
The Threat of Science without Humanity By Richard M. Doerflinger Ask Americans what problems most afflict our nation , and a decline in moral values ranks near the top of the list .<-->O
Yet to hear some lawmakers , scientists , and even ethicists talk , you would think the problem with medical research today is an excess of morality .<-->O
This is clear in the debate on embryonic stem cell research .<-->N
These primitive cells can potentially produce a variety of cells and tissues needed by the human body .<-->N
The moral problem is this : Harvesting the cells from a live human embryo kills the embryo .<-->O
Yet the Clinton Administration insists this should not stand in the way of medical progress .<-->O
This approach is being proclaimed from several quarters .<-->N
The National Institutes of Health -LRB- NIH -RRB- is expected to issue guidelines soon on how researchers can obtain and destroy human embryos to harvest embryonic stem cells which will then be used in federally funded experiments .<-->O
On July 13 the National Bioethics Advisory Commission -LRB- NBAC -RRB- took final votes on its own report , recommending the actual repeal -LRB- rather than just evasion -RRB- of the current law banning federal funding of experimentation in which embryos are harmed .<-->O
The next day , the White House announced it will not try to persuade Congress to repeal the ban on destruction of human embryos , but will evade the ban by funding stem cell research that requires such destruction .<-->O
The White House added assurances that the NIH guidelines will ensure that embryos are des-troyed in an `` ethically sound manner . ''<-->O
That 's right .<-->N
Despite the law passed by Congress every year since 1995 -LRB- the Dickey-Wicker Amendment -RRB- , banning federal funding of destructive embryo research , our government is poised to issue guidelines on how to `` ethically '' destroy human life .<-->O
The co-chair of the NIH task force assigned this challenge is Dr. Ezra Davidson , who came to Congress 's attention in the early 1980s due to his federally funded experiments on low-income black and Hispanic women in south central Los Angeles .<-->O
He had a new diagnostic tool , the fetoscope , but did not know how often its use might cause miscarriages .<-->O
So he practiced using it on women planning to have abortions - - reasoning that if it killed unborn children already slated for death , it would do no real harm.When Congress found out about Davidson 's project , it made sure something like this could not happen again .<-->O
In 1985 it overwhelmingly approved a law requiring all federally funded research projects to treat unborn children intended for abortion with the same respect as children intended for live birth .<-->O
No longer would the `` private '' abortion decisions of these children 's mothers be used to justify spending public funds to harm them .<-->O
But now , Dr. Davidson is back in the saddle - - and so is his ethical approach .<-->O
`` Spare '' embryos in fertility clinics will eventually be discarded anyway - - the argument goes - - so if a researcher destroys them for their stem cells , he is n't doing any real harm .<-->O
By this logic , one could well start buying vital organs from condemned prisoners in China , or conducting lethal experiments on terminally ill patients in VA hospitals .<-->O
After all , they 'll die anyway , so how can we be doing any real harm ?<-->O
This is what the White House means by `` ethically sound '' killing : only the killing of `` spare '' embryos created by fertility clinics , not embryos created solely for research .<-->N
In 1994 , when the NIH proposed creating human embryos especially for research purposes , even newspapers with pro-abortion editorial policies , such as the Washington Post , called the idea `` unconscionable . ''<-->O
There was something too thoroughly demeaning and cold-blooded about initiating human lives merely to destroy them .<-->O
In the end , President Clinton rejected funding for such '' special creation '' experiments , and he is holding to that position now .<-->O
But it is becoming clear that this position is merely a transitional stepa `` wedge '' to open the door to government - sponsored embryo research .<-->O
This came home to me recently , when I spoke on this issue in England to ethicists and scientists who advise a major pharmaceutical firm .<-->N
What I found was a unanimous view among British scientists that embryonic stem cell research will probably be useless for transplant purposes - - unless it uses cloning to create human embryos for destruction .<-->O
The answer is : tissue compatibility .<-->N
Patients bodies will reject transplanted cells from a foreign source and many scientists think this problem will not be solved in the foreseeable future .<-->O
Hence , in Great Britain the debate is not about `` spare '' embryos at all , but about use of cloning to produce embryos genetically identical to each individual patient .<-->O
Each time a patient needs a transplant , he or she will donate some body cells , which will be used to make numerous embryonic twin brothers or sisters - - who will then be killed for their stem cells .<-->O
This British discussion puts into perspective some recent events in our own country .<-->N
In May the Geron Corporation , which has funded research in obtaining stem cells from `` spare '' embryos , announced that it was taking over Roslin Bio-Med of Scotland , which has pioneered animal cloning and produced `` Dolly '' the sheep .<-->N
Geron says the merger will enable it to combine the '' complementary breakthrough technologies '' of stem cell research and cloning `` to enhance and accelerate the development of new transplantation therapies . ''<-->O
The following month , NBAC softened its earlier stand against creating human embryos for stem cell research , saying only that such creation and destruction of life should not be funded at `` at this time . ''<-->O
Scientists on the panel insisted that medical progress using embryonic stem cells may require leaving the door open to creating embryos for research purposes in the future .<-->N
Now I realize the significance of these events .<-->N
They know .<-->N
Geron and NBAC know that the much-touted use of `` spare '' embryos may well fail to produce the promised results .<-->O
But they also know that the `` unconscionable '' step of using taxpayers funds to create human embryos for destruction could doom the entire enterprise in the eyes of public opinion .<-->O
So expect them to proceed with `` spare '' embryos , perfecting the art of culturing stem cells and directing them to differentiate in the lab .<-->N
And when they stand on the threshold of transplantation into humans , expect them to announce that they could save many lives , if only we will allow this one last step .<-->O
The real solution is to refuse to start down that road .<-->O
Genetically compatible tissue for transplantation can be produced by using and adapting patients ' own adult stem cells .<-->N
These are now known to be far more versatile than was once imagined - - and they pose no serious moral problem .<-->O
-LRB- For a fine statement on this subject signed by dozens of medical and scientific experts , see www.stemcellresearch.org . -RRB-<-->N
Some organizations promoting medical research have begun to realize there is more to this controversy than meets the eye .<-->N
On July 29 , the New York Times reported that the American Cancer Society -LRB- ACS -RRB- has withdrawn from the political coalition promoting destructive embryo research , `` Patient 's CURe '' -LRB- Coalition for Urgent Research -RRB- .<-->N
Apparently the ACS originally lent its name to the coalition believing that it would simply call for open debate on the possible benefits of stem cell research generally - - and found itself part of a strident political group that downplays and insults any approach to research that does not destroy human embryos .<-->O
It also found that many of its own constituents and fundraisers were appalled by this foray into pro-death advocacy in the name of research .<-->O
The ACS has therefore stepped back to consider a final position more carefully - - a step that other groups lured into `` CURe '' would do well to emulate .<-->O
But even as private groups take another look at this issue , the question in Washington , D.C. , is : When the NIH invites 60 days of public comment on guidelines implementing this immoral and unnecessary agenda , how will the American people respond ?<-->O
Should Junk Food Be Banned from Schools ?<-->N
An August 2012 study from Pediatrics made a startling discovery after following a group of school-aged children : kids who went to a school without junk food regulations maintained about a 37 percent overweight rate from fifth to eighth grade without budging .<-->N
However , in schools with junk food regulations and bans , the number started at 39 percent in fifth grade and declined to about 18 percent by eighth grade .<-->N
Of course , the results of the study beg the question : Should junk food be banned from schools altogether ?<-->O
Before you start petitioning your PTA , make sure you have all the facts and know how you , as a parent , can help .<-->O
Teaching at home .<-->N
While you might be annoyed by the availability of Twizzlers at your child 's school , it 's important to think about the part you play in the problem .<-->O
`` Unfortunately , blocking junk food is only part of the answer , '' says Dr. Jeffrey L. Cumro .<-->N
`` If we block junk food at school and the kids are allowed to go home and eat whatever they want , we really are n't solving the problem .<-->O
We 're just delaying it , which could lead to bigger binges . ''<-->O
Do n't place the blame on the schools completely : parents have to shoulder some of the responsibility as well .<-->O
Getting involved .<-->N
Most schools make the menu available for parents to read beforehand .<-->N
While you ca n't issue a ban on all unhealthy foods , you can talk about the best choices on the menu with your child the night before .<-->N
Or , head over to the school and take a tour yourself to see what 's available .<-->N
If knowledge is power , knowing what 's offered at school means you have the power to steer your kid toward healthier choices .<-->O
Defining junk food .<-->N
While 16 states have already adopted junk food regulation for their schools , other states might be more hesitant to do so .<-->O
A lot of the issue boils down to the actual definition of junk food .<-->O
After all , one parent might think only candy is junk , while another thinks any type of sugar constitutes as contraband .<-->O
Before you start any type of action plan to get rid of unhealthy grub in your child 's school , take into consideration what junk food really is and temper your expectations accordingly .<-->O
Dealing with fundraisers .<-->N
While getting rid of junk food might sound like a great idea off the bat , consider some of the repercussions at school .<-->O
`` A ban on junk food in schools does not have to prohibit parents from sending junk food with their kids for lunch if they choose , '' family therapist Patt Hollinger Pickett reminds pro-banners .<-->O
If your school banned sugary or fat-laden snacks , would there also be a ban on bake sales and sweets-based fundraisers ?<-->N
If you support a ban , try to come up with alternatives for moneymakers at school as well .<-->O
Taking the reins .<-->N
Just because you 're not a lunch lady does n't mean you ca n't have an influence over school lunches and snacks .<-->O
If you live in a state where your school does n't ban junk , consider petitioning for healthier foods overall instead .<-->O
Melanie Angelis , a teacher and nutritionist , gives some ideas for simple changes to make a big difference at school : `` Replacing the soda machine with a water machine is one option , and offering vegetables as part of a stir fry may also help .<-->O
Choosing the same basic ingredients -LRB- e.g. , potatoes -RRB- but decreasing the processing and unhealthy condiments available is another option , '' she suggests .<-->O
`` The current trend is that parents expect teachers to assume full responsibility or none at all as opposed to working together . ''<-->N
Supporting health programs .<-->N
Most schools offer nutrition as part of their health-based programs .<-->N
If you really want your child to learn the difference between healthy foods and unhealthy choices , support these programs as much as possible .<-->O
Talk to your child about what she learned , volunteer to lend a hand and make sure that the curriculum is being followed so that your good teaching habits at home are reinforced in class as well .<-->O
`` We should not forget that physical inactivity is another large issue causing our obesity epidemic amongst the nation 's youth , '' warns nutritionist Jackie Vega .<-->O
See if you can help out with athletic programs as well as nutrition education .<-->N
Teaching healthy choices .<-->N
So , should junk food be banned altogether ?<-->O
While it makes sense to limit a child 's access to unhealthy foods , chew on this : are you teaching a child to make healthy choices , or simply removing unhealthy options ?<-->O
Some might argue that simply taking away the junk stops your child from learning to make healthy choices on her own , which could be a problem when she 's exposed to sweet treats later .<-->O
A junk food ban does n't necessarily mean healthier kids , just kids with fewer choices .<-->O
It 's an issue that might never have a concrete answer .<-->O
While some love the idea of only healthy foods at school , others do n't like the idea of government taking choices away .<-->O
Should schools ban junk food from canteens ?<-->N
A BAN WILL NEVER WORK By banning junk food you 're just making kids more sneaky , because nobody 's going to give up junk food .<-->O
I mean what are they going to do , check everyone 's lunch everyday to make sure it 's all healthy food ?<-->O
It 's true that junk food is very bad for your health , but I think it 's part of the learning process .<-->O
Students need to learn how to limit themselves ; they need to understand what is too much , and what is okay .<-->O
That 's what a school is for , it 's for learning !<-->N
Nehashree Pradhan Class XI , A.M.S P. Obul Reddy Public School , Hyderabad *** The school canteen is a place where children gather to have a bite of something different from what is in their regular lunch boxes .<-->N
It gives us respite from their hectic schedule while savoring the food provided there .<-->N
Instead of banning junk food , students should be encouraged to go for balanced diet with good food habits .<-->O
Secondly , physical exercise in any form and constructive hobbies should be encouraged .<-->N
Leela P H Class XII , KV Bijapur *** We enjoy eating junk food but there should be certain limits .<-->O
Obesity can be prevented if parents don t allow children to spend too much on junk food , watching TV , using smartphones and computers for long .<-->O
School canteens should make a list of things ordered by us so that they keep a limit for each student .<-->O
Dedipya , Class IX , MEC Public School , Bangalore *** Like most students , I have been enjoying fast food more than often .<-->N
Instead of a ban , we should ensure equal physical activity in the form of any sport as a regular part of the school curriculum .<-->N
Most schools do not even have the infrastructure to ensure this .<-->N
Also , the school canteens should try to provide the children with `` nutri-licious '' food and not with chips , burgers , etc. .<-->N
Shaurya Gaur Class XI , St. Thomas ' School , New Delhi *** I would never support a junk food ban in our school canteen because nowadays parents rarely buy their children junk food .<-->O
In the canteen , we get to enjoy the food and also share it with their friends .<-->N
But parents should only give canteen money once in a while .<-->N
P.T. drills should be part of their timetable during school Nikhil John Thomas Class VIII , Loyola School , Trivandrum *** Junk food ca n't be just separated from one 's life .<-->O
In order to reduce obesity cases , the school should make accounts of students eating in canteen and the school should a fix a limit of providing junk food to a student .<-->O
Devanshu Sharma Class XII , Delhi Public School , Vijayawada *** It is not necessary to completely ban junk foods in school canteens .<-->O
If it is available only on Fridays and on all the other days they can supply foods which are healthy .<-->N
Here is a sample menu : Monday : Bread And Butter ; Tuesday : Fruit Salad ; Wednesday : Grains ; Thursday : Vegetable Salad ; Friday : Puffs Sniffa Class XII , Excel Central School , Thiruvattar *** IT S THE ONLY WAY Junk food may be appealing for variety of reasons , including convenience , price and taste .<-->N
However , regularly consuming fattening junk food can be addictive to children and lead to complications like obesity , low self esteem and even depression .<-->O
Rajat Sinnur , Class X , PPEA High School , Rampur *** We eat junk food knowing such food can make us hollow both mentally and physically .<-->O
So it 's time to say goodbye to McDonald 's , Domino 's pizza , KFC , Subway etc. and eat something healthy and nutritious .<-->N
School canteens must provide something which is full of nutrients and not just of fats .<-->O
Bishnu Prasad Nayak Class X , Army Public School , Gopalpur *** Through school canteens many students get addicted to junk food .<-->N
Students may buy junk food without the knowledge of parents .<-->N
Vigneash , Class X , Vidya Mandir @Estancia , Chennai *** I buy one chocolate and a packet of chips daily .<-->N
But the one day I did not do this , I realized I was very active and the went superbly .<-->O
Try not eating junk food for just one day .<-->O
I promise that you will be able to see a lot of difference .<-->O

First Lady Proposes Ban on Junk Food Marketing in Schools First lady Michelle Obama stepped up the pressure Tuesday against companies selling junk food to students , announcing a new government proposal that would ban advertising of sodas and unhealthy snacks in public schools .<-->O
The new USDA rules would phase out the advertising of sugary drinks and junk foods on vending machines and around campuses during the school day and set guidelines for other in-school promotions , from banners hung in hallways to sponsored scoreboards on school football fields .<-->N
`` Our classrooms should be healthy places where kids are not bombarded with ads for junk food , '' Mrs. Obama said at a White House event .<-->O
Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed First Lady Recites ` Wrap ' at ` Let s Move ' Event 1:34 U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the new rules would eliminate marketing for products that can not be sold in schools .<-->N
`` If you ca n't sell it , you ought not to be able to market it , '' Vilsack said .<-->N
He said companies spend $ 149 million a year marketing food and drinks to kids in schools .<-->N
Mrs. Obama made physical fitness and healthier eating her signature policies when her husband took office in 2009 .<-->F
She announced the proposed rules on the fourth anniversary of her `` Let 's Move '' childhood obesity program .<-->N
The hope is to normalize healthy eating and regular exercise for kids , she said .<-->N
`` So for them the norm will be fruits and vegetables and not chips and candy , '' she said .<-->N
`` So hopefully in the grocery market they will be begging us for items from the produce aisle instead of from the snack aisle . ''<-->O
It s the next step in a process started back in 2006 by former president Bill Clinton s foundation , which worked with beverage companies to limit school drink sales to water , unsweetened juice and low-fat and nonfat milk , flavored and unflavored , in elementary and middle schools , with the addition of diet and sports drinks in middle schools .<-->N
Advocacy groups have been pushing to limit unhealthy snacks and the ads promoting them for years .<-->N
`` Given the high rates of childhood obesity and children 's poor diets , it does n't make sense to advertise and market unhealthy food to children at all , much less in schools , '' said Center for Science in the Public Interest nutrition policy director Margo Wootan CSPI says that in 2012 , 70 percent of elementary and middle school students and 90 percent of high school students attended schools that allowed food marketing , most of it for unhealthy food .<-->O
The Federal Trade Commission says the heaviest marketers are candy and snack food manufacturers , beverage companies , and fast-food restaurants , which make use of posters and scoreboards .<-->N
They also give students coupons , for instance offering pizza as a prize for students who read a certain number of books , and they place advertisements in school television programs and other educational materials .<-->O
California banned sodas and junk food from public schools in 2005 andConnecticut did in 2006 , but most states don t have policies .<-->N
Our priority is supporting the health of kids and they shouldn t be targeted for the marketing of junk foods and drinks , said Sam Kass , executive director of Let s Move .<-->N
OUR PRIORITY IS SUPPORTING THE HEALTH OF KIDS AND THEY SHOULDN T BE TARGETED FOR THE MARKETING OF JUNK FOODS AND DRINKS . ''<-->N
Ads for junk foods such as candy bars , potato chips and other treats that don t conform to the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Smart Snacks in School guidelines would be banned under the proposed rules .<-->O
Those recent USDA guidelines limit calories , sugar , and fat content in food sold to students at 100,000 schools .<-->O
Concessions sold at after-school sports games would be exempt .<-->N
Under the proposal , beverage companies could market their branded lines of bottled water , but not sugary soft drinks .<-->N
The beverage industry led by companies Coca-Cola Co. , Dr Pepper Snapple Group and PepsiCo is on board with the move .<-->N
American Beverage Association President and CEO Susan Neely said in a statement that the changes are is the `` logical next step . ''<-->N
`` Mrs. Obama 's efforts to continue to strengthen school wellness make sense for the well-being of our schoolchildren , '' Neely said .<-->N
The new proposed rules also include a plan to extend the free lunch and breakfast program .<-->N
Schools that already have a large number of students eligible for free lunch or breakfast will be encouraged to expand it to all students .<-->O
`` Millions of children showing up to school hungry every day , '' Mrs. Obama said .<-->N
`` They feel like there s a stigma with participating in the school breakfast program . ''<-->O
The new approach would let all kids get the meals without their parents having to enroll them .<-->N
Studies show children perform better academically and have fewer discipline problems if they are n't hungry during the day .<-->O
Junk Food May Be Prohibited In School Lunches This Fall ; Pending Federal Law Sparks Obesity Debate Gone are the days of chicken fingers , pizza , and French fries at lunchtime , it seems .<-->N
For students attending schools who participate in the National School Lunch Program , they will have to get used to the new the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards , which went into effect July 1 , that prohibit public schools from providing junk food-laden school lunches in the ongoing battle against the child obesity epidemic .<-->O
The new guidelines are a part the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards , created as a result of the Healthy , Hunger-Free Kids Act .<-->N
According to the new rules , middle schools would no longer be allowed to provide sugary drinks , like lemonade and fruit punch , and all caffeinated drinks , like coffee and soda , to students at lunch .<-->O
At some schools , kids won t be able to enjoy Chick-fil-A sandwiches for lunch anymore or celebrate birthdays with cakes and cookies .<-->O
In other schools , vending machines will be cut off at breakfast and lunch in order to meet the latest guidelines .<-->N
Obesity is not just a health issue , it s an economic and a national security issue , said Kevin Concannon , USDA undersecretary for food , nutrition , and consumer services .<-->O
Currently , over 31 million children eat school lunches , according to first lady Michelle Obama s Let s Move campaign page .<-->N
For some students , school is the only place they get a meal .<-->N
In low-income communities , fast food is easy to access and affordable , but healthy food is inaccessible and very expensive .<-->O
Although Obama can t control what parents feed their kids at home , she believes offering only healthy options at school will reduce childhood obesity rates .<-->N
The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act One out of three children are obese .<-->N
The Healthy , Hunger - Free Kids Act of 2010 was created to lower these alarming statistics by setting new federal standards on food .<-->N
The act is a key component of the Let s Move campaign , created by the first lady to help reduce childhood obesity rates and make healthy food accessible to low income communities .<-->O
The act gives the USDA authority to set nutritional standards , helps establish local farms , builds on USDA work to improve the quality of food , expands access to drinking water , and provides funding for schools so they can meet new nutritional standards only a few of the act s initiatives to increase access to healthy meals and monitor nutritional standards .<-->O
A University of California , Berkeley study showed a majority of California parents and kids liked healthier lunch choices offered in school , but parents in other parts of the United States had opposing opinions .<-->N
A Florida family was upset when they were told they could no longer pack lunches for their daughter .<-->N
To follow the newly enforced nutritional guidelines , their daughter s school banned all packed lunches .<-->N
We took it as our lunches didn t qualify , Jeff Carreira , father of the 4-year-old daughter , told The Blaze .<-->N
Kids are also expressing their anger regarding the new food guidelines .<-->N
The hashtag #BringBackOurSnacks is flooding Twitter feeds .<-->N
Thanks to @MichelleObama , lunch has turned into another class , Alex Bozman tweeted .<-->N
We learn how to survive on grass and gluten-free fries .<-->N
Students are posting up photos of their new lunches with disgusted faces .<-->N
As a result of Michelle Obama s new policy , 1,086,00 students stopped buying school lunch , the Washington Times reported .<-->N
At one middle school and high school , kids boycotted for three weeks after their school changed their sandwiches to meet federal standards .<-->F
Kids Addicted to Junk Food ?<-->N
Why are kids so angry ?<-->N
What is it about high calorie , high sugar , and high sodium foods that kids so desperately desire ?<-->O
Three words might explain it all : junk food addiction .<-->O
Michael Moss , author of Salt Sugar Fat : How the Food Giants Hooked Us gives an explanation for these junk food cravings .<-->N
He told Mental Floss that some foods are purposely made with bland ingredients so that you crave more food or you just add enough sugar or salt until your mouth explodes with flavor .<-->O
Puffy snacks , for example , melt very quickly in your mouth , so you desire another bag .<-->O
There can t be that many calories if the food just evaporated on my tongue right ?<-->O
One bag of Cheetos has 150 calories , according to Frito Lays nutritional label .<-->N
That doesn t sound too bad , but once you have three bags , that s 450 calories and 750 milligrams of sodium .<-->O
Food scientist Steven Witherly called puffy snacks one of the most marvelous constructed foods on the planet , in terms of pleasure .<-->O
As far as sugary snacks , new research shows sugar may be just as addicting as crack .<-->N
Maybe that s why kids don t want to end their bake sales .<-->N
Would the new federally enforced plan work ?<-->N
Some children may adjust and embrace the healthier options while others may choose to stop eating school lunch or simply find other ways to sneak in their favorite junk foods .<-->O
For now , we can rely on education to help teach kids and parents the importance of eating nutritious foods and the dangers of excessive fast food .<-->O
Junk Food Banned From Schools , But Will It Help Fight Obesity ?<-->F
Junk food has gotten a lot of press recently .<-->N
The USDA just implemented a ban on selling junk foods in schools , including from cafeterias and vending machines .<-->O
The ban was a provision of the politically popular 2010 Healthy , Hunger-Free Kids Act , which also included improved nutritional standards for school lunches and breakfasts .<-->N
The ban of junk food sales through school vending machines will affect kids in the coming 2013-14 school year .<-->O
Instead of selling candy bars and sodas , schools will ideally vend healthier snacks like granola bars , juices , and whole grain products .<-->O
The idea is that kids will develop healthier eating habits in school and maintain those habits for a lifetime and maybe even pass on healthier eating patterns to their parents .<-->O
But some opponents question whether this approach is effective , or if it will just result in lost revenue for the schools .<-->O
Instead of latching onto produce and whole grains as the only sustainable , healthy dietary choice , Freedman asks if moderately healthier junk food could help the nation collectively lose weight without spending a premium for more `` wholesome '' foods .<-->O
This announcement was well-timed with another high-profile article from Atlantic author David H. Freedman , who writes about the potential for junk food to actually end obesity .<-->O
He argues that fast food companies are already noticing that customers want healthier options , and are adding lower-calorie versions of their dishes to menus across the country .<-->N
He blasts the nation 's `` Pollanites '' for blindly ascribing to a belief that locally-sourced vegetables can turn around the nation 's obesity crisis .<-->N
Instead of latching onto produce and whole grains as the only sustainable , healthy dietary choice , Freedman asks if moderately healthier junk food could help the nation collectively lose weight without spending a premium for more `` wholesome '' foods .<-->O
The school junk food ban , and the Healthy , Hunger-Free Kids Act as a whole , emerged partially as a result of Michelle Obama 's campaign to end childhood obesity .<-->N
This campaign is informed by the writings of Michael Pollan and other sustainable food advocates .<-->N
But Freedman has a point when he writes that the lifestyle promoted by the `` Pollanites '' is often only accessible to families or individuals with enough income to afford expensive food .<-->O
So where does this leave us ?<-->N
Could healthier junk food or fast food provide an easy way to address the nation 's rising obesity rates ?<-->O
Junk food ban in schools set to begin but could create black market Students around the US can blame First Lady Michelle Obama and the US Department of Agriculture when they can t get their junk-food fix , or have to rely on fruit juice to satisfy their sweet tooth next school year .<-->O
TagsChildren , Health , Law , USA , Food Starting July 1 , schools will no longer be able to sell unhealthy junk food in cafeterias , vending machines or at bake sale fundraisers that occur during school hours , according to a new mandate from the USDA .<-->O
Schools will have to replace the junk with nutritious items .<-->N
But that healthy food has its own set of requirements .<-->N
Back in February , Obama spoke at an event with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to unveil the new rules .<-->N
The idea here is simple our classrooms should be healthy places where kids aren t bombarded with ads for junk food , Obama said in a statement .<-->O
Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home , their work shouldn t be undone by unhealthy messages at school .<-->O
According to the USDA website , The Smart Snacks in School standards stipulate that all snack foods sold in school must be ` whole grain rich , ' meaning they contain 50 % whole grains or have whole grains as the first ingredient , or have as the first ingredient a fruit , a vegetable , a dairy product or a protein-rich food .<-->N
Combination foods that contain at least cup fruit and/or vegetable or naturally contain 10 % of the daily value -LRB- DV -RRB- of calcium , potassium , vitamin D or dietary fiber will also be accepted .<-->O
The site goes on to add that the Smart Snacks in School rules don t apply to foods brought from home or to special occasions , including birthday parties , off-campus fundraisers , athletic events and school plays or foods sold during non-school hours -LRB- 30-mins after school -RRB- .<-->N
High school students also get exceptions .<-->N
They will be able to purchase caffeinated and low-calorie carbonated drinks , Fox 59 reports .<-->N
But , for the most part , students will be choosing between water , milk and 100 percent fruit and vegetable juice .<-->N
Schools will no longer be able to promote junk food through posters or billboards .<-->O
And sometimes this means they need to purchase new vending machines .<-->N
`` We have had healthy foods in the vending machines for several years , but the vending machines used to say Coke , and Pepsi .<-->N
Now , we 're advertising the healthy food that we are offering to the kids , '' said Amy Maclosky , director for Food and Nutrition Services in Arlington , Va. , told RFD TV .<-->N
`` If you ca n't sell it , you really ought not to be able to market it , Vilsack said at the February event .<-->O
Despite the potential lost revenue for both schools and advertisers like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo , the American Beverage Association -LRB- which includes the two soft drink giants -RRB- , supports the new mandate .<-->O
Mrs. Obama 's efforts to continue to strengthen school wellness make sense for the well-being of our schoolchildren , ABA President and CEO Susan Neely said in a statement .<-->N
Our industry helped lead the way with our voluntary national School Beverage Guidelines , which removed full-calorie soft drinks , cut beverage calories in schools nationwide by 90 percent , and set the stage for the USDA s regulations that take effect in schools this July .<-->N
Now , we look forward to working with the USDA on their proposed rule to align food and beverage signage in schools with the new regulations as the logical next step .<-->N
Schools that don t comply face hefty fines or loss of federal funding , Fox 59 reports .<-->N
And some schools are finding that complying leads to waste and black markets for junk food .<-->O
In 2011 , the Los Angeles Unified School District changed its menu at the beginning of the school year , focusing on a menu chock full of healthy lunches .<-->N
But now the school district had to revamp its menu again before the year was even through , bringing back hamburgers on a daily basis , cutting exotic dishes like quinoa and bringing back -LRB- healthified -RRB- pizza , the Los Angeles Times reported .<-->O
LA Unified found that meals were being thrown out instead of eaten , students ditched lunch altogether and a black market in junk food thrived .<-->O
Speculation abounds online , with a whole comment thread on Reddit devoted to whether or not the USDA s new ban will lead to more black markets .<-->O
Why banning junk food could make your child FATTER Stopping ourselves and , increasingly , our children overeating can be a daily battle .<-->O
Instinct might tell you to bin the biscuit tin and stop the sweet treats .<-->O
So what I am about to say might seem odd .<-->O
As a psychologist who has spent many years helping patients overcoming compulsive eating habits , I know that outlawing all junk food often backfires with very serious consequences .<-->O
In fact , doing so could sow the seeds of a lifelong battle with compulsive overeating .<-->O
WE CRAVE WHAT WE CAN T HAVE Many patients at my clinic describe being denied treats , only to fanatically overcompensate by obsessing about food .<-->N
One woman s father had been brought up in the austerity of post-war Britain and was fastidious about her not eating between meals and clearing everything on her plate .<-->N
So the moment she got her first Saturday job she spent all her wages on crisps , chocolate and milkshakes to make up for all the things she felt she d missed out on .<-->N
Another male patient in his 40s had parents who only ever kept apples and fig rolls in the house as snacks for the children so whenever he went to parties at the houses of other children , he gorged on treats and cake .<-->N
And so a pattern of behaviour was set : he later took to stealing any chocolate his parents kept for grown-ups , and when he had dinner money to spend , he bought yes , you ve guessed it McDonald s .<-->O
As an adult , splurging 50 in KFC , Burger King and Krispy Kreme gave him that same thrill .<-->N
Part of growing up is being able to make our own decisions and assert control .<-->N
When we have the freedom to eat what , when and where we like during our teenage years , there is a natural tendency to explore things that might have been off-limits at home .<-->O
Foods that are often banned are high in fat and sugar , which are shown to stimulate the pleasure centres of the brain .<-->O
This , coupled with the excitement of doing something perceived as illicit , can be a highly addictive mix .<-->N
STOP USING FOOD AS A WEAPON I m not saying you should offer your children pizza and chips every day or cave in to their demands for ice cream at breakfast .<-->O
But if they do ask for a treat , say : OK , why don t we have it on Friday after dinner ?<-->N
Let them be part of the choice .<-->N
Explain that if we eat cakes all the time , it s not good for our bodies , but we can eat them sometimes .<-->N
If they ask for a fast-food burger , say you have already planned dinner but suggest having one at the weekend .<-->N
Try to use neutral language and not to be emotional about it , or demonise any single food .<-->N
Don t warn them : You ll get fat like me !<-->N
as this heaps pressure on a developing mind .<-->N
The point is that most foods are fine in moderation .<-->O
Don t use food as a reward for good behaviour or take it away as a form of punishment .<-->N
Another classic problem is discovering your child has gone to school with a healthy lunch box , and simply swapped their food for crisps and sweets .<-->O
If your son or daughter wants these foods , try to build them in occasionally say once a week to a mostly healthy diet .<-->O
If you find out about secretive eating , talk about it .<-->N
Getting it out in the open , saying it s understandable and doesn t need to be hidden removes much of the motivation .<-->O
FACE THE REASONS YOU EAT It is predicted that half of Britons will be obese the medical term for weight that poses a serious health risk by 2050 .<-->O
It s more than a problem of eating too much and doing too little .<-->O
The truth is that many of us eat for emotional reasons , like seeking comfort from food , and it is that which millions of dieters struggle with daily .<-->O
Overeating doesn t always start in childhood , but in my experience the groundwork is usually done then .<-->N
Another patient of mine shows how these problems arise .<-->N
As a girl , she was made to finish every morsel on her plate , and if she refused the same food , it would be brought out again and again cold , congealed and even more unappetising than before .<-->O
Her parents were using food as a form of control .<-->N
She learned early on that gaining approval and love was conditional on eating , even if she wasn t hungry .<-->O
As an adult she became a compulsive overeater , and extremely overweight .<-->O
She binged in a futile attempt to stop feelings of self-loathing .<-->O
And , of course , is the bigger she became , the worse she felt .<-->O
And because she never wanted her own children to experience her distress and hunger , they were over-fed , and ballooned in weight from an early age .<-->O
The woman had tried diets , but she was only able to tackle the root of her problem and begin to lose weight through therapy .<-->O
IDENTIFY THE URGE To reveal your food relationship history , think back to certain times in your life childhood , adolescence , adulthood and write down your thoughts about food during each of these times and what part it played .<-->O
If you can explore this , not only does it help you to acknowledge these things in your past , you can move on from them , and therefore not have the same negative feelings about yourself time and again .<-->O
You may emotionally eat for many reasons not just strict parental attitudes towards food , which is disastrous in many cases .<-->O
Maybe you overeat to suppress negative feelings about yourself or use food for emotional comfort when you can t get it anywhere else in your life .<-->O
Emotional eating often has its roots somewhere in your past .<-->N
Until you can recognise and understand the urge to overeat , the danger is that you will just keep using food to deal with what goes on emotionally .<-->O
The urge to over-eat is usually unconscious , repetitive and automatic .<-->N
When you feel yourself needing to emotionally eat you want to eat but you don t feel hungry stop and examine your feelings .<-->O
Apply the five Ws : who , what , where , when and why .<-->N
Make notes to get the facts out of your head which will help you calm down .<-->O
By thinking more carefully about your situation you can learn to let any emotionally provoking incident lose its intensity and influence and stop the spiral into overeating .<-->O

It 's like crack cocaine for comfort eaters Refined carbohydrates another term for sugar display all the hallmarks of an addictive drug in the way they affect us .<-->O
They give an instant buzz that s both pleasant and mood-altering .<-->N
Indeed , lab studies on rats suggest sugar affects their brain chemistry in a similar way to cocaine .<-->N
But you don t need a scientist to tell you that food can be seductive .<-->O
Eating creates pleasant sensations that can change our mood , and anything packed with refined carbohydrates , such as cakes and chocolate , will cause an instant lift and energy boost .<-->O
Consuming refined carbohydrates accelerates the absorption of an amino acid that our brain converts to serotonin , a neurotransmitter that makes us feel good .<-->O
If you re feeling down , comfort eating is an instant way of giving yourself a lift and sugar is the crack cocaine of comfort eating .<-->O
It s for this reason that at addiction treatment centres chocolates and sweets are prohibited .<-->N
Food can become an addiction just like any other .<-->O
If this sounds a little crazy , let s try comparing the effects of refined carbohydrates to another addictive substance alcohol .<-->O
When an alcoholic is feeling down , they ll take a drink in order to give themselves a lift .<-->N
The same can be said for sugar .<-->N
When we binge on refined carbohydrates , we consume way beyond a healthy calorie intake , and the reason we re doing so is to change the way we feel .<-->O
Alcohol is a substance that a large proportion of the adult population overindulges in , to the point where it causes serious health problems .<-->O
This can be said of sugar , too .<-->N
In fact , statistics show the negative cost of obesity to the nation s health is far higher than for booze .<-->O
Alcoholics can t control the amount they drink , regardless of the consequences .<-->N
It s the same with sugar .<-->N
No one wants to overeat to the point where they become morbidly obese , yet there are people all around us who can not help themselves .<-->O
Food is a mood-altering substance with addictive properties .<-->N
No wonder we re a nation of addicts .<-->N
Should junk food be banned at school ?<-->F
Two mums go head to head .<-->N
Most schools still sell junk food .<-->N
Why one mum thinks it s great , and another wants it banned .<-->O
NO Kids need to learn to make good choices .<-->O
By Shauna Anderson The thought of banning junk food in schools makes me fear for the generation of adults these children will become .<-->O
A walking talking cast of zombies , unable to think for themselves or make judgments about their boundaries .<-->O
A generation of adults so used to restrictions that the tiniest chance of rebelling makes them cast aside all their inhibitions .<-->N
A generation unable to educate their own children about nutrition because they never learned to make their own choices .<-->N
Of course there is a problem with obesity in Australian children , but a myriad of problems are contributing to that junk food advertising , inactivity , too much screen time , badly manufactured food It is a whole society problem not one that should just be tackled in schools .<-->O
Junk food shouldn t be banned from schools .<-->N
What s next ?<-->N
A ban on computers because we blame them for obesity ?<-->N
Throughout Australia there are different approaches to what foods are allowed at schools in lunch boxes and to be served at canteens .<-->N
In NSW , VIC and QLD a traffic light system applies with foods categorized according to their nutritional benefits .<-->N
This system works .<-->N
Kids can occasionally indulge in the red light foods .<-->N
They learn about food choices .<-->N
Children s education : Children need to learn to think for themselves .<-->O
They need to be educated to make healthy choices , they need to understand the consequences of what they are eating , to just blanket ban junk foods is such a lazy approach .<-->O
Kids should be involved in packing their lunch boxes , in sampling different foods , and in choosing to occasionally bring in a bag of Cheezels on a special occasion .<-->N
Parental responsibility : So just because some parents are simply too lazy to be bothered to make their children a healthy lunch , the rest of the children those who do know moderation , who do practice responsible nutrition , who are in control of what they eat have to suffer .<-->O
Why is that right ?<-->N
Parents need to take control of what they feed their kids , not the schools .<-->N
The fun police strike again : There has to be some fun left .<-->O
Already we ve seen bans on cartwheels and soccer games , on playing brandings and swapping animal cards .<-->N
An occasional packet of chips , a juice once a week at lunchtime , an ice block on a hot day .<-->N
There would not be a seven year old in Australia who doesn t find that a delight .<-->N
A chocolate heart slipped into your lunch box by Mum on Valentines Day ?<-->N
A cupcake on the teacher s birthday ?<-->F
A bacon and egg roll at the Father s Day breakfast ?<-->N
Why should we restrict these choices because of fear mongering ?<-->O
Why can t children have the ability to choose these treats at the appropriate time and place and learn to appreciate these foods as a treat ?<-->O
YES It s hard enough to get kids to eat healthily .<-->N
By Jo Abi Every day I face a battle to keep my children healthy .<-->N
I have to balance their food intake , their exercise , I make sure they are dressed warmly and are looking after themselves .<-->O
I pack healthy lunches .<-->N
Occasionally they get a treat and lunch orders are a once a week event .<-->N
My life would be a lot easier if junk food was banned in schools .<-->O
Children are at school five days out of seven .<-->N
Imagine how influential it would be if they only sold healthy food ?<-->O
My children s school tries to limit junk food provided to students but there s always something .<-->N
They have a treat at school , at a friend s house , while we are shopping , at a party I can only control my children s food intake so much without being a total Scrooge .<-->O
I want them to have junk food sometimes , but schools need to support parents efforts to keep our children healthy .<-->O
Together we can make a real difference to Australian children s health .<-->N
This is why I want junk food banned in schools .<-->N
They need to be in a completely healthy environment in school and that includes the food that is on offer at the canteen .<-->O
If schools only served healthy foods and drinks it would be a huge weight off parent s shoulders and it would send the right message .<-->O
It would teach them about healthy foods and support the health messages they are being taught in class .<-->O
When they do use the canteen they can choose from choices like sandwiches , sushi , salads and plain milk .<-->N
We are in the midst of an obesity crisis in Australia .<-->N
Drastic action is needed .<-->N
It s been predicted that for the first time , we are raising a generation that will not outlive us .<-->N
How can we let this happen ?<-->N
It s a health crisis .<-->F
I recently found out that my son has been buying garlic bread almost every single day since he started school .<-->F
He always has money in his wallet for the bus and for drinks .<-->F
I noticed he was going through it faster than he should have then found out where it was going ?<-->F
What is a school doing selling garlic bread , cheesy pizzas , nuggets , chicken chipees and potato smilies ?<-->F
Why are they selling meat pies and sausage rolls ?<-->N
These are not the kind of foods I want my children exposed to on a regular basis .<-->O
Schools need to back up health messages and support parents who are struggling to limit the amount of junk our children eat .<-->O
Get rid of junk food in schools and set a better example for our children .<-->O
Do you think junk food should be banned in schools and school canteens ?<-->O
Does your child s school sell junk food ?<-->N
How do you control their food intake ?<-->F
Sugar ban : Junk food should be axed from school to stop tooth decay Vending machines selling sweets and fizzy drinks should also be banished from public places according to leading British academics .<-->O
New research has shown that sugars in the diet should make up no more than three per cent of total energy intake to reduce the financial and social burdens of tooth decay .<-->N
Co-author Professor Philip James , honorary professor of nutrition at the London School ofHygiene & Tropical Medicine , said : Our top priority is not to allow the idea of a magic single bullet to solve the problem to be developed .<-->O
There now needs to be an explicit revision of population dietary goals as it relates to every aspect of government policy .<-->N
We need to make sure that use of fruit juices and the concept of sugar-containing treats forchildren are not only no longer promoted , but explicitly seen as unhelpful .<-->O
Food provided at nurseries and schools should have a maximum of free sugars in the complete range of foods amounting to no more than 2.5 per cent of energy .<-->O
Vending machines offering confectionary and sugary drinks in areas controlled or supported financially by local or central government should be removed .<-->N
We are not talking draconian policies to ban such sugar-rich products , which are available elsewhere , but no publicly-supported establishment should be contributing to the expensive problems of dental caries -LRB- fillings -RRB- , obesity and diabetes .<-->O
The food industry should be told that they should progressively reformulate their products to reduce or preferably remove all the sugars from their products .<-->O
New food labels should label anything above 2.5 per cent sugars as high .<-->O
Given the politics of big business , the most governments may do is to reduce the limit from 10 per cent to 5 per cent but our paper suggests that it should be 2.5 per cent .<-->O
A sugars tax should be developed to increase the cost of sugar-rich food and drinks .<-->N
This would be simplest as a tax on sugar as a mass commodity , since taxing individual foods depending on their sugar content is an enormously complex administrative process .<-->O
The retail price of sugary drinks and sugar rich foods needs to increase by at least 20 per cent to have a reasonable effect on consumer demand so this means a major tax on sugars as a commodity .<-->O
The level will depend on expert analyses but my guess is that a 100 per cent tax might be required .<-->O
The research , from experts at University College London and the LSHTM , published in the journal BMC Public Health , analysed the effect of sugars on tooth decay .<-->N
It found that sugars are the only cause of decay in children and adults .<-->N
Free sugars as defined by the World Health Organisation Nutrition Guidance Advisory Group include sugar added to foods and also naturally present in honey , syrups , fruit juices and fruit concentrates .<-->N
Tooth decay affects up to 90 per cent of school children and the vast majority of adults .<-->N
The treatment of dental diseases costs five to 10 per cent of total health expenditure in industrialised countries .<-->N
Only two per cent of people at all ages living in Nigeria had tooth decay when their diet contained almost no sugar , around 2g per day Aubrey Sheiham Researchers used public health records from countries across the world to compare dental health and diet over time across large populations of adults and children .<-->N
They found that the incidence of tooth decay was much higher in adults than children , and increased dramatically with any sugar consumption .<-->O
Current guidelines from the World Health Organisation set a maximum of 10 per cent of total energy intake from free sugars , with five per cent as a ` target ' .<-->N
This equates to around 50g of free sugars per day as the maximum , with 25g as the target .<-->N
The latest research suggests that five per cent should be the absolute maximum , with a target of less than three per cent .<-->O
Study author Aubrey Sheiham , Emeritus Professor of Dental Public Health at UCL , said : Tooth decay is a serious problem worldwide and reducing sugars intake makes a huge difference .<-->O
Only two per cent of people at all ages living in Nigeria had tooth decay when their diet contained almost no sugar , around 2g per day .<-->N
This is in stark contrast to the USA , where 92 per cent of adults have experienced tooth decay .<-->O
5 Reasons Fast Food Should Be Banned It s not a secret that fast food is bad for you .<-->N
I don t think I just blew your mind by writing that .<-->O
I do , however , think that people believe that there s nothing wrong with eating fast food in moderation .<-->O
It really comes down to ignorance being blissful .<-->O
I love the analogy that our bodies are like vehicles .<-->O
You want the best fuel for your car , but do you always provide the right fuel for your body ?<-->O
The fast food industry gives that option to people , giving you regular when your gas-guzzler requires premium .<-->N
The main reason fast food should be foods to avoid is an obvious one : it can lead to many health problems such as obesity , heart disease , and diabetes .<-->O
Fast food consumption is probably one of the most common addictions that nobody talks about .<-->N
The addiction leads to disease .<-->N
People talk about the seriousness of alcohol and smoking addictions ; however , how many fast food addiction help centers are there ?<-->O
It doesn t appear to be a big concern because people have to eat .<-->O
And , if there were public service announcements about how you should limit your fast food consumption , how do you think the big corporations would act ?<-->O
Let s just say it s not going to happen anytime soon .<-->N
The solution is about making informed and healthier choices .<-->N
A lot of people realize that the Big Mac is causing health problems , but do they relate that mouth-watering meal to why they are angry at the world or are getting divorced ?<-->O
When you realize the role fast food plays on your health and on society , you may discontinue your daily or weekly trip to your favorite burger or pizza joint .<-->N
Here are five reasons I believe fast food should be banned : Fast Food Isn t Even Food Pretty much every nutritional expert will tell you not to eat any processed food , especially fast food .<-->O
They don t even consider it food , not even the so-called healthier options with fewer calories .<-->O
For your body to function properly , it needs quality nutrients .<-->N
There is very little fiber , vitamins , or minerals in your fast food , which means your digestion is instantly compromised .<-->O
Fast foods should definitely be foods to avoid .<-->O
They are highly processed , piled with refined sugar , salt , saturated fat , and hydrogenated fat .<-->O
It s also no secret that factory-farmed animal products and genetically modified foods are the fast food industry s best friends .<-->O
Fast Food Affects Your Brain Have you ever wondered why you feel so calm and clear-minded , and other people are so angry at the world ?<-->O
The fast food industry plays a big part with this .<-->N
Omega-3s are essential fatty acids that are beneficial for brain health .<-->O
A fast food-oriented diet lacks these nutrients , one of the reasons fast foods are foods to avoid .<-->O
Magnesium , tryptophan , and low glycemic foods are all essential for proper cognitive function .<-->O
B vitamins such as folic acid -LRB- B9 -RRB- will help prevent mental issues like paranoia and decreased memory .<-->O
Eating too many carbohydrates such as hamburger buns , French fries , and pizza will affect your mood and may cause depression and anxiety .<-->O
It makes sense then that people who regularly eat fast food are 51 % more likely to become depressed , according to a study .<-->O
Whenever you have a goal to accomplish , adding fast foods to your list of foods to avoid and eating plenty of real foods -LRB- fruits , vegetables , grains -RRB- will help you focus .<-->O
Fast Food Quickly Drains Your Wallet A lot of people justify their fast food habit based on cost .<-->N
I want something cheap and easy , they might say .<-->O
The truth is the cost really adds up !<-->O
Depending on the location , basic fast food meals can range between five and eight dollars .<-->N
You could easily spend $ 15 - $ 20 making a homemade meal , instead of spending $ 40 - $ 50 on a family of four eating one fast food meal -LRB- another reason to add them to your list of foods to avoid -RRB- .<-->O
What Are the Advantages of Single Sex Education ?<-->F
The Question What are the advantages of single sex education ?<-->N
Is single sex education better than coeducation ?<-->N
What does available research have to say about the subject ?<-->N
Background We have spent several generations advancing the equality of the sexes .<-->N
Beginning with the women 's suffrage movement and continuing through to the present day many legal and social barriers to women 's equality with men have been removed .<-->N
Much progress has been made .<-->N
With that in mind coeducation which is based on that laudable theme of equality seems like the right way to go .<-->O
That 's why most private and public schools use the coeducation model .<-->N
Most of the time that works well .<-->N
On the other hand some research seems to suggest that boys and girls learn in different ways .<-->N
Research shows that a girl 's brain is different from a boy 's brain .<-->N
If you accept that premise , coeducation probably will not work satisfactorily for every child .<-->O
Coeducation does have the advantage of being politically acceptable .<-->N
Recently public schools have begun to experiment with single sex classes , and , in some cases , single sex schools .<-->N
The Research Perhaps the most revealing research on single sex versus coeducation is Single-Sex Versus Coeducational Schooling : A Systematic Review .<-->N
This study was commissioned by the federal Department of Education and was released in 2005 .<-->N
What were its conclusions ?<-->N
Basically it seems to conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest single sex education is better than coeducation or vice-versa .<-->O
Another national study from UCLA Graduate School of Education & Information Studies claims to show that girls from single sex schools have an edge over their coed peers .<-->N
The Right Setting for Your Child Some children thrive in a single sex school .<-->N
For one thing , the social pressures can be gentler .<-->F
Your child can grow at his own pace .<-->N
This often is a good thing for boys as they mature later than girls .<-->N
The faculty at single sex schools understand how their students learn .<-->N
They adapt their teaching styles to those specific needs .<-->N
There are other advantages as well .<-->N
For example , since a single sex school is basically homogeneous , that simplifies planning events and activities as you only have to consider boys or girls as the case may be .<-->N
The conventional thinking thirty years ago was that coeducation would somehow break down gender stereotypes .<-->O
But that did n't always happen .<-->N
The proponents of single sex education argue that boys in coeducational settings are less likely to take courses in the arts or tackle advanced academic subjects simply to avoid being typecast as a nerd .<-->O
Similarly girls avoid the sciences and technology subjects because they do n't want to appear to be tomboys .<-->O
Single sex schools are flourishing once again as parents realize that allowing their son or daughter to learn in his or her own individual way is a very important consideration in choosing a school .<-->O
Three Reasons for Choosing a Single Sex School Your child 's happiness is one of the most important factors in selecting a school .<-->O
Equally important is finding a school with inspiring , gifted teachers .<-->O
But we parents also need to consider three other factors : letting your child be herself , the teaching style and what 's being taught and , finally , the socialization of our children .<-->O
Let Them Be Themselves Boys tend to soften their competitive edge and become more collaborative in a single sex setting .<-->N
They can just be boys and not worry about what the girls might think .<-->O
Boys enjoying poetry and playing in an orchestra as opposed to a marching band are the kind of thing you will see in a boys ' school .<-->O
Girls drop their shyness and begin to take risks in a single sex setting .<-->N
They become more competitive .<-->N
They embrace sports like field hockey and soccer with gusto without worrying about appearing like tom boys .<-->O
Academics If the teacher understands how to teach girls , they will quickly feel comfortable exploring non-traditional subjects such as mathematics , advanced sciences , computers and technology , wood-working and so on .<-->O
Boys participate in choirs and orchestras and learn Latin in single sex settings .<-->N
Children will break out of their stereotypical roles and behavior when they are left to their own devices .<-->O
Single sex education has a delightful way of encouraging children to be fearless , to be curious , to be enthusiastic - in short , to just be themselves .<-->O
Socialization Children are subjected to an avalanche of pressures from every quarter to become adults before they are ready to do so .<-->O
They grow up too quickly .<-->N
Why not let them be children for a few more years ?<-->N
Single sex education with its gentler , more controlled social outlets is just the ticket for many children .<-->N
Blended or Co-Institutional Schools Many Roman Catholic schools offer their own unique approaches to single sex schooling by offering co-institutional or blended schooling .<-->N
Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora , Colorado , has two distinct high schools operating under the same roof : one for boys , the other for girls .<-->N
This is the co-institutional approach .<-->N
St. Agnes and St. Dominic School in Memphis , Tennessee , blends its single sex education with co-educational depending on the grade level involved .<-->F
Compare the separate campus , the co-institutional and the blended schools .<-->N
Any one approach might be right for your son or daughter .<-->O
Boys ' schools and girls ' schools have many advantages to consider .<-->N

Boys in School Where the Girls Are : The Facts About Gender Equity in Education -LRB- 2008 -RRB- How Effective is Single Sex Teaching More Choices in Single Sex Education NASSPE Single-Sex vs Coed : The Evidence Single-Sex Public Schools Teaching Boys and Girls Separately ---------------------------- Single-Sex Schools Have Negative Impact on Kids , Says Study Boys and girls may be opposites , but new research shows that in the classroom , separating the two sexes may not be the best way for either gender to learn and grow .<-->N
A new report , published in the journal Science , states that students who attend single-sex schools are no better educated than those who attend co-ed schools .<-->O
Plus , children are more likely to accept gender stereotypes when they go to an all-boys or all-girls school .<-->N
`` There 's really no good evidence that single-sex schools are in any way academically superior , but there is evidence of a negative impact , '' said Lynn Liben , professor of psychology and education at Penn State and co-author of the study .<-->O
`` Kids ' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited , and there could be long-term consequences where , for example , girls are used to being in roles only among other girls , then they have to face the real world where that 's not the case . ''<-->O
Supporters of single-sex schools argue that boys ' and girls ' brains are wired differently , and therefore require different teaching styles to maximize education , but study authors note that neuroscientists have not found hard evidence that show differences in girls ' and boys ' different learning styles .<-->O
The report also cited a 2010 study which compared two preschool classes .<-->N
In one class , the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children .<-->F
The other teacher did not .<-->N
After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex .<-->O
The kids also showed an increase in gender-specific stereotypes -LRB- i.e. boys played with trucks , girls with dolls -RRB- .<-->N
The study also noted that a review commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education found little overall difference in academic outcomes between children in single-sex schools versus those in coed schools .<-->N
Title IX of the U.S. Education Amendments outlawed discrimination on the basis of gender in educational programs that receive federal funds , meaning students were no longer allowed to be rejected from gender seemingly-specific classes , like home economics or metal shop .<-->O
But Liben said several people still argue for gender separation in the classroom .<-->N
`` We know from the history of our country that separate is not equal , '' said Liben .<-->N
`` There 's no reason to divide along the lines of biological sex . ''<-->N

`` There 's no reason to divide along the lines of biological sex . ''<-->N
------------ Argument For & Against Single Sex Schools Single-sex high schools , boarding schools and colleges have their advantages , but they are n't for everyone .<-->N
Some students prefer to study in an environment that offers both male and female perspectives and provides a way to build relationships with both sexes .<-->N
Even though students at single-sex schools do n't interact with the opposite sex on a daily basis in the classroom , many schools provide activities on weekends that both males and females can attend .<-->N
Educational Opportunity A positive argument for single-sex schools is the educational opportunity it provides .<-->O
In coed schools , females are often stereotyped as being weak in math and science , and males are stereotyped as being weak in language arts .<-->N
At single-sex schools , males and females can explore educational opportunities without being constrained by expectations , stereotypes or prejudices .<-->N
For example , girls at single-sex schools are more likely to explore nontraditional subjects and are encouraged to be daring and invest in subjects they might otherwise not try , according to the National Association for Single Sex Public Education .<-->O
Customized Learning A benefit of single-sex schools is customized learning .<-->N
Because boys and girls learn material in different ways and have specialized methods for exploring new subjects , teachers can customize their teaching strategies to meet gender-specific needs .<-->N
For example , some girls have longer attention spans and might not need to change settings or take breaks as frequently as boys .<-->O
On the other hand , some boys can set up science equipment and visualize academic concepts faster than girls .<-->N
Specialized teaching is referred to as differentiated instruction and is much easier to implement in a same-sex classroom than a coed classroom , says the National Association for Single Sex Public Education .<-->N
Student Personalities Single-sex schools can create problems for students who do n't have defined gender-specific personalities .<-->N
Not all males have the same temperament and not all females have the same disposition .<-->N
As a result , gender differences in learning are n't always the same .<-->N
For example , a sensitive , conversational , artistic boy might struggle in an all boys ' classroom , and an assertive , domineering , competitive girl might not get along well with highly feminine peers .<-->O
The teaching style in a single-sex classroom could be ineffective or detrimental for students who do n't have gender-specific personalities , according to the Great Schools website .<-->O
Future Interactions Single-sex schools are disadvantageous when students do n't learn how to communicate and interact with members of the opposite sex .<-->N
Many students from single-sex classrooms eventually work in coed offices and must be able to converse with clients and coworkers of both genders .<-->N
They might join coed community organizations , clubs or religious groups .<-->N
Students in single-sex schools have limited opportunity to connect with members of the opposite sex and learn how to work cooperatively on projects and assignments , according to Great Schools .<-->O
---------- Wesley Sharpe offers two points of view on this hot topic !<-->N
What happens to the bright-eyed exuberance of girls between the primary grades and high school graduation ?<-->O
Do schools shortchange boys ?<-->N
Could single-gender classes or schools make a difference ?<-->N
Some California educators think so .<-->N
On opening day of the 1999 school year , the Jefferson Leadership Academies became the first public middle school in the country to offer separate classes for boys and girls .<-->N
About 1,000 uniformed sixth , seventh , and eighth graders entered single-gender classes .<-->F
`` Some people pay a lot of money to send their children to these kinds of schools .<-->N
... We thought maybe this is something that could work in a public school setting , '' Kristi Kahl , coordinator of the Long Beach California Unified School District 's middle school reform , told the Los Angeles Times -LRB- `` Same-Sex Classes to be Offered at Long Beach Middle School '' ; May 9 , 1999 -RRB- .<-->O
`` It is really hard to say how you can attribute -LSB- improvements -RSB- to gender separation , how much you can attribute to instruction , and how much you can attribute to parent commitment .<-->O
But in reality , probably all of those things come into play . ''<-->N
It 's too early to judge the success or failure of the Jefferson Leadership Academies .<-->O
`` But there is evidence of change , '' principal Jill Rojas told Education World .<-->N
According to a report recently released by the Long Beach USD Office of Research , Planning and Evaluation , the students are doing very well .<-->N
The district has compared cumulative grade point averages -LRB- GPAs -RRB- to current GPAs for all students who attended Jefferson in 1998-99 and who are currently enrolled in 1999-2000 .<-->N
Among the findings : `` Student grade point averages for students who had previously attended Jefferson in either grades 6 or 7 increased for all students , male and female , in both grades 7 and 8 under the single gender academy configuration .<-->N
`` The increase was statistically significant for both genders at grade 7 and for males at grade 8 . ''<-->N
`` We have seen many students start to focus heavily on academics , '' Rojas continued .<-->N
`` They no longer clown or try to impress the opposite sex .<-->N
Girls are more apt to answer questions aloud in class as well as ask them .<-->N
Girls are learning to be more academically competitive and boys are learning to collaborate . ''<-->O
When asked about specific problems in Jefferson 's single-gender classes , Rojas responded , `` Some teachers have had a hard time with their all-boy cores -LSB- classes -RSB- , but I feel it is based somewhat on the fact that they feel more physically challenged by boys who misbehave than by girls . ''<-->O
SINGLE-SEX CLASSES In 1992 , a widely publicized report stated that public schools shortchanged girls .<-->N
The report fueled interest in single-sex classes and schools .<-->F
The following year , American University professors Myra and David Sadker published Failing in Fairness : How America 's Schools Cheat Girls .<-->N
The book describes striking discoveries about fairness in American schools .<-->N
During a three-year study , trained observers visited more than 100 classrooms in Connecticut , Maryland , Massachusetts , Virginia , and the District of Columbia .<-->N
The responses observers noted in those elementary-school classrooms included the following : Boys called out eight times as often as girls did .<-->F
Teachers ignored the `` raise your hand '' rule .<-->F
If a boy yelled out , the teacher usually praised his contribution .<-->F
Girls who called out got reminders to raise their hands .<-->F
Teachers valued boys ' comments more than girls ' comments .<-->F
Teachers responded to girls with a simple nod or an OK , but they praised , corrected , helped , and criticized boys .<-->N
Boys were encouraged to solve problems on their own , but teachers helped girls who were stuck on problems .<-->N
Teachers of all-girl classes seemed to validate the idea that girls performed better in single-sex classes .<-->O
`` I enjoy seeing girls participate so much in class discussions .<-->O
... And , like it or not , girls seem to talk more in class in an all-female school .<-->N
I often see a whole classroom of eighth graders sharing ideas in an animated manner , '' said Sharon Johnson-Cramer .<-->N
She teaches history to seventh and eighth graders at the all-girls Winsor School in Boston and wrote What a Single-Sex School Is Really Like , published in The Christian Science Monitor -LRB- electronic edition -RRB- .<-->F
`` Compare this with a scene I used to face daily : a coed class of 10th graders , in which many of the boys talked but it took the teacher 's calling on the girls to get them to participate .<-->N
Even when I taught such units as Women and Islam or Female Infanticide in India at the coed school , it was still the boys who talked the most in class , '' Johnson-Cramer said .<-->O
Anecdotal evidence seems to support the benefits of single-sex high school classes .<-->O
But Anita P. Davis , Ed.D. , director of teacher education at Converse College , a private liberal arts college for women , told Education World that research does n't support that view .<-->O
`` With teachers who treat them fairly , female high school students can perform academically as well as male students in the same class , '' Davis said .<-->O
SINGLE-SEX EDUCATION CHALLENGED In 1998 , the American Association of University Women -LRB- AAUW -RRB- published Separated by Sex : A Critical Look at Single-Sex Education for Girls .<-->N
Single-sex education is not necessarily better than coeducation , that report noted .<-->O
The publication `` challenges the popular idea that K-12 single sex education is better for girls than coeducation . ''<-->O
According to the report , boys and girls thrive on a good education , regardless of whether the school is single-sex or coeducational .<-->O
`` There is no evidence in general that single-sex education works or is better for girls than coeducation .<-->N
`` When elements of a good education are present , girls and boys succeed .<-->N
Elements include small classes and schools , equitable teaching practices , and focused academic curriculum .<-->N
`` Some kinds of single-sex programs produce positive results for some students , including a preference for math and science among girls .<-->N
-LSB- Although -RSB- girls ' achievement has improved in some single-sex schools , there is no significant improvement in girls ' achievement in single-sex classes . ''<-->O
CLOSING THE GENDER GAP In fact , recent research seems to show that the gender gap between boys and girls has closed .<-->N
`` All of this suggests that the broad nationwide efforts to raise female achievement in schools have been effective , '' said Cornelius Riordan , a professor of sociology at Providence College , in The Silent Gender Gap , a November 17 , 1999 , Education Week story .<-->O
`` As a result of these trends , boys rather than girls are now on the short end of the gender gap in many secondary school outcomes .<-->N
Currently , boys are less likely than girls to be in an academic -LRB- college-preparatory -RRB- curriculum .<-->N
They have lower educational and occupational expectations , have lower reading and writing test scores , and expect to complete their schooling at an earlier age , '' Riordan explained .<-->N
William S. Pollack , an assistant clinical professor at Harvard Medical School and author of Real Boys : Rescuing Our Sons From the Myths of Boyhood , offered a similar opinion in `` The Hidden Suffering of Boys in the Classroom , '' -LRB- San Jose Mercury , August 8 , 1998 -RRB- .<-->N
Noting that schools are `` failing boys in at least four ways , '' Pollack wrote that Boys ' reading and writing problems often go unnoticed .<-->O
`` One study found a correlation between boys ' low reading skills and their association of reading with feminine skills , '' said Pollack .<-->N
People often handle boys emotional and social needs inappropriately or inadequately .<-->O
`` When we observe boys ' emotional worlds more closely , we discover much quiet suffering under their outward bravado . ''<-->O
Educators tend to interpret `` boy behavior '' as a discipline problem without probing to discover emotional needs .<-->O
`` Boys generally prefer to learn by doing , by engaging in some action-oriented task .<-->O
In learning environments biased against their strengths , boys may become frustrated and attempt to get their needs met by seeking negative attention . ''<-->O
Teaching methods fail to take into account boys ' unique learning styles .<-->O
`` Many classes simply are n't conducted in a way boys , with their naturally high energy levels , find captivating .<-->O
When boys are n't engaged , they become discipline problems , '' Pollack concluded .<-->N
WHAT 'S IN THE FUTURE ?<-->N
To help determine the future of single-gender classes , additional research on the effectiveness of those classrooms appears necessary , Anita Davis told Education World .<-->O
`` Educators must expand the research base using existing single-sex classes and schools .<-->N
And create additional classes ... that improve the public school system .<-->N
Researchers must promptly share significant findings on single-gender education with the education profession and with the general public . ''<-->O
Davis explained .<-->N
Single-gender academies similar to the Jefferson Leadership Academies may be the answer .<-->F
The California Department of Education summarized research on single-gender educational programs in a Fact Sheet : Single Gender Academies Pilot Program .<-->F
The report indicates that single-gender education Seems to reduce the number of dropouts .<-->N
Improves the general academic performance of urban males and the math and science achievement of females .<-->N
Creates a setting that appears to reduce the distracting behavior boys and girls fashion for one another .<-->N
Motivates students and parents .<-->N
`` The effectiveness of single-gender programs may be due more to students ' and parents ' motivation , commitment , and small class size than to the fact that they enroll only boys or girls . ''<-->O
What can educators and parents do about the gender gap between boys and girls ?<-->N
`` There is plenty we can do .<-->N
By designing an inviting educational experience for boys , by ` guy-ifying ' certain aspects of schools , and by ensuring that schools help boys thrive as individuals , we can help boys boost not only their academic performance and self-esteem but also their dreams for the future , '' said Pollack .<-->O

Read more about the name change at the new web site .<-->F
This web site , the `` old '' web site singlesexschools.org , continues to receive more than 100,000 hits a month .<-->N
So we will continue to maintain it , for the time being .<-->N
Since the founding of NASSPE/NACE in 2002 , there has been a resurgence of interest in all-girls or all-boys public education in the United States .<-->N
Unfortunately , this exuberance has led some school districts to plunge into experimentation with this format without a thorough grounding in the complexities of the single-gender format .<-->N
Without proper training , the single-gender format does not magically boost outcomes , and may even lead to disappointing results .<-->O
With proper training in how best to take advantage of the single-gender format , however , good outcomes are more likely .<-->O
Advocates of single-sex education do NOT believe that `` all girls learn one way and all boys learn another way . ''<-->O
On the contrary , we cherish and celebrate the diversity among girls and among boys .<-->O
We understand that some boys would rather read a poem than play football .<-->O
We understand that some girls would rather play football rather than play with Barbies .<-->O
Educators who understand these differences can inspire every child to learn to the best of her or his ability .<-->O
Conversely , educators and parents are recognizing that all too often , coeducational settings actually reinforce gender stereotypes via the process that researchers call `` gender intensification . ''<-->O
Many boys at coed schools will tell you `` poetry is for girls . ''<-->N
Many girls at coed schools will tell you that computer science is for boys .<-->N
The good news is that the gender-separate format can boost grades and test scores for BOTH girls and boys .<-->N
However , that improvement does n't happen automatically .<-->N
Just putting girls in one room and boys in another is no guarantee of success .<-->N
As already noted , and as with anything else in education , adequate preparation in proven , evidence-based strategies is key .<-->O
We now have good evidence that single-sex classrooms CAN break down gender stereotypes , particularly when teachers have appropriate professional development .<-->O
Girls in single-sex educational settings are more likely to take classes in math , science , and information technology , especially when teachers have received appropriate training .<-->O
Boys in single-gender classrooms -- led -LRB- once again -RRB- by teachers with training in how to lead such classrooms -- are much more likely to pursue interests in art , music , drama , and foreign languages .<-->O
Both girls and boys have more freedom to explore their own interests and abilities than in the coed classroom .<-->O
It 's not sufficient just to put girls in one classroom and boys in another .<-->O
In order to improve academic performance and broaden educational horizons , you 'll need to understand the subtleties of gender differences in learning .<-->O

-------- Research Spotlight on Single-Gender Education If you walked into the average public school classroom in the United States , you 'd find an equal number of boys and girls .<-->N
But some experts suggest it may be time for a change .<-->N
Single-gender education and the often-spirited dialogue surrounding it have raised a number of issues concerning the best manner to educate boys and girls .<-->N
In 1993 , American University professors Myra Sadker and David Sadker published their research in Failing in Fairness : How America s Schools Cheat Girls , which describes striking discoveries about fairness in American schools .<-->N
During a three-year study , trained observers visited more than 100 elementary school classrooms in Connecticut , Maryland , Massachusetts , Virginia , and the District of Columbia and noted student-teacher interactions , including the following : Boys called out eight times as often as girls did .<-->N
When a boy yelled out , the teacher ignored the `` raise your hand '' rule and usually praised his contribution .<-->F
Girls who called out got reminders to raise their hands .<-->F
Teachers valued boys ' comments more than girls ' comments .<-->F
Teachers responded to girls with a simple nod or an OK , but they praised , corrected , helped , and criticized boys .<-->N
Boys were encouraged to solve problems on their own , but teachers helped girls who were stuck on problems .<-->N
Male dominance in the classroom may come as no surprise to advocates of single-gender education who suggest that boys and girls are regularly treated differently in coeducational settings and that both boys and girls could both benefit from single-gender classrooms .<-->O
Studies suggest that when boys are in single-gender classrooms , they are more successful in school and more likely to pursue a wide range of interests and activities .<-->O
Girls who learn in all-girl environments are believed to be more comfortable responding to questions and sharing their opinions in class and more likely to explore more nontraditional subjects such as math , science , and technology .<-->O
In addition , advocates believe that when children learn with single-gender peers , they are more likely to attend to their studies , speak more openly in the classroom , and feel more encouraged to pursue their interests and achieve their fullest potential .<-->O
Of course , these beliefs have been challenged as well .<-->N
The American Association of University Women published Separated by Sex : A Critical Look at Single-Sex Education for Girls -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , which notes that single-sex education is not necessarily better than coeducation .<-->O
According to the report , boys and girls thrive on a good education , regardless of whether the school is single-sex or coeducational .<-->O
Some findings include : No evidence shows that single-sex education works or is better for girls than coeducation .<-->N
When elements of a good education are present such as small classes and schools , equitable teaching practices , and focused academic curriculum girls and boys succeed .<-->O
Some kinds of single-sex programs produce positive results for some students , including a preference for math and science among girls .<-->N
Additional research on the effectiveness of single-gender classrooms is necessary , but we all can agree that we need to construct an educational environment that meets the social and intellectual needs of boys and girls .<-->O
Here are two additional studies from the current research on single-gender education : Is Single-Gender Schooling Viable in the Public Sector ?<-->N
Lessons from California s Pilot Program -LRB- PDF icon PDF , 402 KB , 83pp -RRB- This report provides a good background and review of the literature with a broad assessment of where research stands on the controversy .<-->O
It covers a pilot program in California , the nation 's biggest pilot project , a project that was subsequently shut down .<-->N
This report presents the findings of a three-year case study of an experiment of single-gender schools with the public sector .<-->N
It provides a thorough analysis of the topic and examines future directions for single gender school reform program .<-->N

The Evidence Suggests Otherwise : The Truth About Boys and Girls -LRB- PDF icon PDF , 363 KB , 21pp `` The real story is not bad news about boys doing worse ; it 's good news about girls doing better .<-->O
In fact , with a few exceptions , American boys are scoring higher and achieving more than they ever have before .<-->N
But girls have just improved their performance on some measures even faster .<-->O
As a result , girls have narrowed or even closed some academic gaps that previously favored boys , while other long-standing gaps that favored girls have widened , leading to the belief that boys are falling behind .<-->O
There 's no doubt that some groups of boys particularly Hispanic and black boys and boys from low-income homes are in real trouble .<-->O
But the predominant issues for them are race and class , not gender .<-->N
Closing racial and economic gaps would help poor and minority boys more than closing gender gaps , and focusing on gender gaps may distract attention from the bigger problems facing these youngsters .<-->O
The hysteria about boys is partly a matter of perspective .<-->O
While most of society has finally embraced the idea of equality for women , the idea that women might actually surpass men in some areas -LRB- even as they remain behind in others -RRB- seems hard for many people to swallow .<-->O
Thus , boys are routinely characterized as ` falling behind ' even as they improve in absolute terms . ''<-->O

-------- Should I send my child to a single-sex school ?<-->N
It s a schoolyard like any other .<-->N
Students stream out of class and claim the playground in a hail of shrieks .<-->N
A basketball soars into the air and lands squarely in the hoop , and there s more hooting and hollering .<-->O
There s something different about this schoolyard .<-->N
Only boys attend school here .<-->F
Girls are nowhere in sight .<-->F
At a classroom across the country , students cluster around a machine they are building , soldering irons and wrenches in hand .<-->F
But in this room , all of the kids are girls , and they re learning about robots by making one themselves .<-->N
Is a single-sex school right for my child ?<-->N
Families pick single-sex schools for a variety of reasons .<-->N
Some feel that single-sex schools offer fewer distractions , while others believe they offer a more equitable learning environment , still others choose a single-sex school because it aligns with their religious beliefs .<-->O
In many cases , families choose a school for other features a curriculum that reflects their child s interests , for example and the fact that the school is single sex has little to do with the choice .<-->O
In the long run , parents should consider the academic strengths of a school and their child s interests first and foremost .<-->O
If your daughter is a science geek , for example , then you ll want to choose a school with a strong science program , whether it s single-sex or co-ed .<-->N
If a boy loves music , and the best choir program is at a single-sex school , than that may be the best fit .<-->O
Explain to your child what a single-sex school is and what it offers .<-->N
Visit the school , and make sure your child gets to sit in on classes and talk to other students .<-->N
Make sure your child knows what the environment is like without members of the opposite sex to play with all day long .<-->O
Some kids welcome the idea .<-->O
Others may not .<-->N
A modern phenomenon : the rise of single-sex schools The idea of single-sex schools may seem quaint and old-fashioned reminiscent of Jane Eyre , or Madeline , who walked through the streets of Paris with her all-girl classmates in two straight lines , in Ludwig Bemelmans beloved children s books .<-->O
In fact , single-sex education is rapidly taking root across the United States .<-->N
What used to be offered only in private schools is spreading to public classrooms across the country .<-->N
Why has single-sex education seen such rapid 21st-century gains ?<-->N
In 2006 , a key change in Title IX , the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in schools , made it legal for publicly funded school districts to create single-sex schools and classrooms .<-->O
Since then , private and public single-sex enrollments have grown .<-->N
Supporters attribute the spread of single-sex education to the fact that it raises the bar for girls and boys , giving both sexes an opportunity to thrive and overcome traditional sex roles .<-->O
But critics believe the science behind these claims is seriously flawed .<-->O
What you might find in a single-sex school or classroom Specialized curriculum : Yes , the basics are important , but so is participation in community service , choir , visual arts , drama , health and fitness , and business and entrepreneurial studies .<-->O
At some single-sex schools , PE isn t running around the track ; instead , students learn Pilates , hip-hop dance , and yoga .<-->N
Some single-sex schools give students a head start in basic life skills , such as doing laundry and budgeting money .<-->N
At Garrison Forest School in Owings Mills , Maryland , girls take classes on financial literacy and social entrepreneurship .<-->N
All girls from third to twelfth grade get a dose of money smarts in the school s Financial Literacy and Social Entrepreneurship program .<-->F
At the Pacific Boychoir Academy in Oakland , CA , performance is incorporated into the school s music program .<-->N
John Lynch , the school s academic director , says the fact that Pacific Boychoir Academy is single-sex allows students to relax and feel more confident .<-->O
They get the freedom from the pressure of being around girls , he says .<-->N
This is a fragile time in boys lives It allows boys to be little boys longer .<-->N
Gender-busting courses : Some boys schools explore traditional male roles and teach skills traditionally associated with women , such as sewing and cooking .<-->N
Girls get classes in team leadership and robotics .<-->N
At Columbus School for Girls in Columbus , Ohio , for example , an all-girls team builds robots and competes in the national FIRST -LRB- For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology -RRB- program .<-->F
Small class sizes and enrollment : Some single-sex schools have a student body of only a few dozen , making it possible for class sizes to remain small and instruction to be highly personalized .<-->N
Public school option : Single-sex education is growing at public school districts across the country as an alternative kind of charter school .<-->N
There are now about 500 public schools that offer single-sex education around the country .<-->N
Of these , 390 are co-ed schools that offer a single-sex classroom .<-->F
At Public School 140 in the Bronx , for example , girls have their own classroom .<-->N
Students follow the regular curriculum but also focus on women s issues -LRB- girls study the lives of influential black women such as Harriet Tubman and First Lady Michelle Obama , for instance -RRB- .<-->O
Religious studies may be part of the curriculum : Many single-sex schools are affiliated with Jewish temples and Catholic and Protestant churches , and offer courses in religious studies and theology .<-->N
At the all-boys Chaminade High School in Mineola , New York , You ll have young men playing football , but also in glee club , tutoring , on yearbook and teaching religious education after school , says school president Brother Thomas Cleary .<-->N
In a co-ed school , girls tend to take up a lot of the spots in the non-athletic clubs and activities .<-->N
At Chaminade , the boys can do whatever they want .<-->N
The school holds many after-school events where morality and faith are discussed , and Cleary believes the boys are more open during these sessions than they would be if girls were included .<-->O
Uniforms and dress codes : At many single-sex schools , students follow a casual dress code , but still wear a uniform .<-->N
It can be as simple as a polo shirt or skirt of the same color .<-->N
Some schools require coats and ties .<-->N
School officials say the dress code works well in instances where a group is required to travel or perform at a venue far away and needs to be instantly recognizable .<-->O
Dates with other schools : Single-sex schooling doesn t mean zero contact with the opposite sex .<-->N
Some single-sex schools partner on a regional basis to share the same calendar , making co-ed events like dances and sports events possible .<-->N
A holiday dance , for example , may include both girls and boys .<-->N
What to look out for in a quality single-sex school Single-sex schools have the same goals that most schools share : to give students the skills and knowledge base they need to go on to college and to have meaningful careers .<-->O
Many single-sex schools incorporate some aspect of character-building teaching respect or emotional intelligence into their curriculum .<-->O
For boys , this may mean focusing on nonviolent ways to communicate and exploring how to be a good friend .<-->O
For girls , it may mean teaching leadership and public speaking skills .<-->N
Many single-sex schools find ways to incorporate fine arts or dramatic performances as part of their academic offerings , and some have won national and international attention for their efforts .<-->N
-LRB- Look out for Grammys on the hallway walls . -RRB-<-->N
These schools can often attract teachers committed to single-sex education who bring advanced degrees and college-level instruction to the school .<-->F
Deans and directors at many single-sex schools are former college instructors and administrators .<-->N
What supporters say Less competition between sexes : Single-sex supporters argue that competing with boys can prevent girls from learning the communication and leadership skills they need to succeed .<-->O
Single-sex education gives girls the opportunity to pursue their interest in nontraditional fields such as science and math .<-->O
Boys also learn to interact with their peers without being overwhelmed by girls , who often have more highly developed communication skills .<-->N
Some studies have found that girls score higher on tests when they re in a single-sex classroom , although these findings have been disputed -LRB- see below -RRB- .<-->N
Educators point to some research indicating that girls who attend single sex schools do better on standardized tests than those at co-ed schools .<-->O
Single-sex advocates argue that this is because teachers tend to pay attention to louder , more aggressive boys , and call on girls less often as a result .<-->O
Rewriting gender roles and defying sexism : Gender stereotypes are part of our culture ; advocates say that single-sex schools actively work to reverse these stereotypes in their curriculum and afterschool activities .<-->N
Adapted to differences in how girls and boys are wired : Supporters point to research showing that language skills for boys develop more slowly than for girls , giving girls an edge early in life .<-->N
Single-sex education gives boys a chance to learn at their own pace .<-->N
Fewer distractions from academic work : Some students , especially teens , spend a good part of the school day flirting or fighting or thinking about members of the opposite sex .<-->O
In fact , some single-sex schools were established to help kids from low-income urban neighborhoods where violence , high dropout rates , and teen pregnancy were rampant .<-->O
Demanding curricula in single-sex schools , these supporters say , turns the focus back to education .<-->N
High college acceptance rates : Many of the schools emphasize college-track academics for students , including Advanced Placement courses and intermediate college courses .<-->N
One Chicago public charter school for boys , Urban Prep Academies , boasts a 100 percent college acceptance rate , for example .<-->N
What critics say The benefits are suspect .<-->O
Although supporters tout the science , some of the largest studies of single-sex schools aren t clear about the benefits of being in an all girls or boys classroom .<-->N
Some critics argue that single-sex schools attract students whose families are more involved in their education and push them academically , and this explains the positive academic outcomes demonstrated in some studies of single-sex schools .<-->O
Milder critics say that while there may be benefits for girls , single-sex education is bad for boys .<-->O
Many single-sex critics also cite major problems with studies proporting to show the benefits of single-sex education .<-->O
In fact , one of the largest reviews of single-sex school studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Education found these studies inconclusive when it comes to the benefits of single-sex education .<-->O
Even the National Association for Single Sex Public Education admits that many of the single-sex classrooms across the country share co-ed activities with the rest of the school , so differences in outcomes are hard to verify .<-->N
Single-sex public education is unconstitutional .<-->N
The American Civil Liberties Union -LRB- ACLU -RRB- opposes public single-sex schools and classrooms on constitutional grounds .<-->N
The ACLU is concerned that the revisions to Title IX allowing single-sex education in public schools will lead to separate but unequal education .<-->O
-LRB- Read more about the ACLU s position . -RRB-<-->N
There s faulty scientific research .<-->N
Some researchers question the science that purports to show that girls learn differently than boys , and that there are major differences in the wiring of girls and boys brains .<-->O
According to these scientists , differences in learning outcomes for girls and boys are the result , in large part , of nurture , not nature .<-->O
In an article in the journal , Science , scientists argued that single-sex education actually reinforces gender stereotypes that are harmful to both girls and boys : There is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism , the authors conclude .<-->O
Students who attend single-sex schools can t relate to the other sex .<-->N
One large study from the Institute of Education in London concluded that boys who attended an all-boys school were more likely to be divorced by the time they are 40 .<-->O
Another study contends that interaction between girls and boys leads to healthier relationships as they grow mature .<-->N
A final word of advice Find out if the single-sex school you re considering is accredited by a regional or national organization .<-->N
Still , accreditation is not always a surefire stamp of approval .<-->N
Some excellent schools lack accreditation by a regional group .<-->O
But membership in a national or regional organization can give a school single-sex educational resources that it might not have on its own , such as opportunities for collaborative teaching and international studies .<-->O
Some schools belong to the National Coalition of Girls Schools or the International Boys Schools Coalition .<-->N
But if they don t , don t be surprised .<-->F
Some are so new they don t yet have a track record .<-->F
Many single-sex schools don t go beyond the eighth grade , an age when many children hit puberty and their curiosity in the opposite sex is heightened .<-->N
If your child is no longer interested in a single-sex education , it may be a good time to transition to a co-ed high school .<-->O
Finally , visit any school you are considering for your child .<-->N
Get input from other parents , teachers , and the principal .<-->N
Ask questions that will give you as complete a sense of the school as possible .<-->O
Make sure you feel that this is the right school for your unique child .<-->O
----------- Are Single-Sex Schools Really Beneficial ?<-->N
Single-sex schools are often said to provide a better education and promote a stronger self-image among attendees .<-->N
For example , media reports have stated girls are more likely to take math if they go to a single-sex private school ; boys may learn better if girls are not around ; and a single-sex education is best for girls in stereotypically male subjects .<-->O
New research , however , questions this assumption with findings suggesting that not everyone benefits from a single-sex education especially not those who don t conform to gender norms .<-->O
In the peer-reviewed journal Sex Roles , scientists from Concordia University present findings that show girls in single-sex schools in Colombia more often report feeling more pressure to act like typical girls than their counterparts in mixed-sex schools .<-->O
Dr. William Bukowski , a Concordia psychology professor , and his research team interviewed 469 fourth - , fifth - and sixth-grade girls from same - and mixed-sex schools .<-->N
The girls were asked to respond to statements I like to do the things that most girls like to do to establish feelings related to gender identity .<-->O
This research was carried out in lower-middle class neighborhoods in Bogot and Barranquilla , Colombia .<-->N
By performing the study in Latin America , the researchers had increased access to same-sex schooling because of the greater frequency of all-girls schools .<-->F
The traditional Latin American emphasis on machismo also provided a more marked contrast between the genders .<-->N
Whereas tween-aged girls from single-sex schools who display characteristics typical to their gender are less likely to be victimized by their peers , there is no such association for the girls in mixed-sex schools , said Concordia Ph.D. candidate Kate Drury , lead author of the study .<-->O
Along with feeling like more typical girls , the girls in the single-sex schools felt more pressure to conform to gender norms -LRB- e.g. It would bother the kids in my class if I acted like a boy -RRB- , suggesting that spending more time with same-gender peers leads to feeling more pressure to behave like a girl , Drury said .<-->O
In other words , it doesn t matter whether boys are present or not , if children feel a lot of pressure to conform to gender norms then it follows that being gender atypical in that environment is going to be difficult , she said .<-->O
What does this mean for the single - vs. mixed-sex schooling debate ?<-->O
The negative repercussions of not conforming to gender roles are stronger in all-girl schools , said Bukowski .<-->N
Parents of gender atypical children should take these factors into account when deciding on what school is best .<-->N
---------- Are single-sex schools good for education ?<-->N
I attended an all girl high school and it was a wonderful experience .<-->N
I find the argument that it makes people socially awkward because they are n't exposed to the opposite sex to be very silly .<-->O
Obviously there are exceptions but unless you have zero encounters with the opposite sex outside your school day there are plenty of other chance to learn how to interact with the other gender outside the classroom .<-->N
In fact in my experience I find that girls from my high school are more assertive in the classroom and life .<-->O
Also the drama is far reduced compared to other high schools because without boys around the source of a lot of drama is eliminated .<-->O
I would also like to say that I went from an all girl setting to majoring in engineering where I was surrounded by men .<-->N
I had no problems making friends .<-->N
Again there are always exceptions but I have found that single sex education does n't make an awkward person - people are either awkward or not .<-->O
However , it is a very powerful educational tool where the focus is on academics .<-->O
You know the way school should be .<-->N
Social settings are important for developing children .<-->N
One most important lessons they learn in life is how to network and navigate a social hierarchy .<-->O
I feel like the risk of a socially stunted child outweigh the potential academic benefits , of single sex education .<-->O
I was educated at a single sex school from the age of eleven onwards and I sometimes wonder how my experience of growing up might have been different .<-->O
I certainly agree with Alexandra 's comment that many young women learn how to be more assertive -LRB- and perhaps ambitious -RRB- individuals .<-->O
I seem to recall a recent study suggesting girls at single sex schools -LRB- in the UK at least -RRB- are more likely to opt for science and maths subjects at A Level .<-->O
Perhaps I can only speak for myself here , but I also think that the environment has nurtured my feminist ideology and I stand by the idea that `` there 's a special place in hell for women who do not support other women '' .<-->O
Overall , I do believe single-sex schools are good for education , but especially in the case of women .<-->O
I might add that I have the remainder of my life to figure out the rules of the `` dating game '' so I 'm not too fussed about the social drawbacks .<-->O
It 's not a priority .<-->N
Yes they r really good enough it keeps u away from unwanted distractions and focus on ur goal plus u feel more comfortable and lively with person of ur sex u understand more about u , it 's highly beneficial For technical education .<-->O
But there 's a lot more to school than just book knowledge .<-->O
Children do n't get the right exposure in single sex schools .<-->N
They often end up behaving awkward in public .<-->N
They do n't learn to respect the other sex .<-->O
They 're not able to make friends with the other sex comfortably .<-->O
I know nothing about this , but is very interested .<-->O
One of my friends came up with the idea to separate boys and girls when they are little -LRB- 5-10 years maybe -RRB- but later on have them in the same class .<-->O
That 's because we ca n't argue against that boys and girls have a different concentration spand and learn differently - especially in those first years .<-->O
I think it was an interesting idea .<-->O
As one who attended an all male prep school I say yes .<-->N
It is not for everyone but I think it should be an option provided we ensure both genders receive a high quality education one of the girl in my engineering stares at boys . .<-->O
i wondered why she do so . .<-->N
later realized , she wants to overcome the fear of looking at men when she becomes a manager . .<-->O
--------- Single-Sex Education Unlikely to Offer Advantage Over Coed Schools , Research Finds WASHINGTON Single-sex education does not educate girls and boys any better than coed schools , according to research published by the American Psychological Association analyzing 184 studies of more than 1.6 million students from around the world .<-->N
The findings are published online Feb. 3 in the APA journal Psychological Bulletin .<-->N
Proponents of single-sex schools argue that separating boys and girls increases students achievement and academic interest , said author Janet Shibley Hyde , PhD , of University of Wisconsin-Madison .<-->O
Our comprehensive analysis of the data shows that these advantages are trivial and , in many cases , nonexistent .<-->O
A separate analysis of just U.S. schools had similar findings .<-->N
Researchers also looked at studies that examined coed schools that offered single-sex instruction in certain subjects and found no significant benefits for boys or girls in these cases .<-->O
Some studies showed modest benefits for both boys and girls in math performance in single-sex schools , but not for science performance .<-->N
However , these advantages in math were not evident in studies with more rigorous research methods .<-->O
The analysis , funded by the National Science Foundation , included studies of K-12 schools published from 1968 to 2013 .<-->N
Among the studies , 57 used stronger research methods , such as studies in Trinidad and Tobago and Korea that randomly assigned thousands of students to single-sex or coed schools and tracked their outcomes .<-->N
Other examples of more rigorous studies controlled for pre-existing differences between students , such as testing students before and after they enrolled in either a single-sex or coed institution .<-->N
The total sample included 1,663,662 participants in 21 countries .<-->N
The studies examined students performance and attitudes in math and science ; verbal skills ; and attitudes about school , gender stereotyping , aggression , victimization and body image .<-->O
They did not find sufficient evidence to show any difference in these attitudes between boys and girls in single-sex or coed classrooms .<-->O
Theories that single-sex education may be better for students have included the idea that without boys in the classroom , girls would be able to thrive in traditionally male-dominated subjects , such as math and science .<-->O
The theoretical approach termed girl power argues that girls lag behind boys in some subjects in coed classrooms , said co-author Erin Pahlke , PhD , of Whitman College in Walla Walla , Wash. This is not supported by our analysis and , moreover , girls educational aspirations were not higher in single-sex schools .<-->O
The authors noted the lack of studies on single-sex education among low-income students and ethnic minorities , particularly in the U.S. , and recommended further research in these populations .<-->O

Selling Your Organs : Should it be Legal ?<-->F
Do You Own Yourself ?<-->N
Imagine your little girl needs a heart transplant .<-->O
If she gets it in time , she ll live a long , healthy life .<-->O
Without it , your child has , at most , one year to live .<-->N
You put her on a heart donor waiting list , full of hope .<-->O
A year surely that s plenty of time .<-->O
But then , the days bleed into weeks , the weeks into months and you watch your child slowly lose her valiant battle .<-->O
Time is running out .<-->N
You don t want to believe it .<-->O
You tell yourself a donor will be found , has to be found .<-->N
But suddenly , the 365 days that , at first , seemed like all the time in the world , has run out .<-->N
Your little girl draws her last breath .<-->N
You hold her lifeless body in your arms , wondering how it could be that in all this time , no donor could be found .<-->O
Tragically , this saddest of endings is all too common According to the government site organdonor.gov , An average of 18 people die each day waiting for transplants that can t take place because of the shortage of donated organs .<-->N
And that number is on the rise .<-->N
The graph on the government s organ donor website shows we are falling further and further behind .<-->N
ADVERTISING Is there anything we can do about it ?<-->N
Under the current system , probably not .<-->F
But there are alternatives .<-->N
Each has its own moral and legal issues .<-->N
One alternative is to institute a presumed consent system .<-->N
You know that decal on your driver s license that says you want your organs to be donated upon death ?<-->O
Under this system , that decal wouldn t be necessary .<-->N
You d be presumed to consent unless you specified that you do not consent to having your organs donated after death .<-->O
Spain has instituted this program with significant success .<-->N
In addition to presumed consent , Spain uses dispatching donor networksthat monitor emergency rooms around the country .<-->N
The networks ask families of the recently deceased for permission to harvest organs .<-->N
So far , the networks have seen only a 15 % national rate of refusal .<-->N
To be fair , Spain is a standout .<-->N
Of the 24 countries in the EU that have this system , Spain and Belgium are the greatest success stories .<-->N
And the U.S. does have a version of this system , but it s limited .<-->N
In the U.S. , hospitals have the right to presume consent when no family member can be found and no declaration has been made .<-->O
Obviously , those conditions mean presumed consent doesn t apply in many cases .<-->O
Coordination and government funding issues aside , a universal presumed consent system like that in effect in Spain and Belgium could be an important step toward solving the donor problem in this country .<-->O
But even presumed consent won t entirely solve the problem .<-->O
Presumed consent only harvests organs after the donor is deceased .<-->N
And the fact of the matter is , we have an ever-increasing aging population that will consistently outstrip those supplies .<-->O
If we are to get out ahead of the problem , there has to be an increase in live donations as well .<-->O
This is where the more libertarian minded argue that if our bodies are ours to manage , it should follow that we are also able to sell our organs .<-->O
They argue that the financial incentive will increase the supply of live donors so significantly , it will eliminate the market shortage .<-->O
The libertarians argue that organ sales not presumed consent , which they claim not only violatespersonal freedom , but also is ineffectual over the long run is the answer .<-->O
There s a certain logic to their thinking .<-->N
We don t expect altruism to drive markets in most other aspects of our daily lives .<-->N
Ralph s Markets , Macy s , BMW dealers , you name it they d all go out of business in a New York minute if they had to rely on the altruism of farmers , garment manufacturers , or auto parts manufacturers .<-->N
The same can be said of the organ market .<-->N
As long as it relies upon altruism , there will always be a shortage of organ donors .<-->O
In fact , there is some evidence that the financial incentive works .<-->N
Organ sales are permitted in the Philippines as long as the donor recipients are natives .<-->N
A Filipina organ recipientdescribes the domestic market : Nobody in these parts , she said , would donate a kidney without getting paid .<-->N
And the market is thriving .<-->N
This recipient stated that the prices for organs are going up .<-->N
Iran uses a hybrid system of free market and government control .<-->F
There , vendors sell their organs to the government , which acts as an intermediary .<-->N
It pays them and gives them free health insurance for one year .<-->N
Donor recipients must be Iranian and they are required to work to pay for the cost of their organs .<-->N
The system has virtually wiped out the waiting lists for donors .<-->N
But there are dissenters , some of whom even object to Iran s hybrid model .<-->N
One dissenting group says that any market based system will necessarily be exploitative of the poor since they re the ones who ll be most tempted to take the risks in order to get the rewards .<-->O
The poor of Pakistan and China haveshown willingness to sell corneas on the black market for money .<-->O
A market system black or otherwise exploits such abject poverty .<-->O
There is , however , a blind spot to that thinking .<-->O
Who works in coal mines ?<-->N
Who enlists in the military ?<-->N
It is the working poor , to a large extent .<-->N
The coal mines , the military are unquestionably high risk occupations .<-->O
If we re so worried about exploiting the poor , why do we allow them to do these dangerous jobs ?<-->O
Because we know it s their right to assume the risk of a dangerous job if they deem the reward worthwhile .<-->O
By parity of reasoning , if the poor are allowed to choose these high risk jobs , then doesn t it logically follow that they should be able to decide whether to take the risk of selling their own organs ?<-->O
It s an interesting , albeit somewhat chilling argument .<-->N
This leads to the second group of dissenters , whose viewpoint is described by the Hastings Center on Bioethics : In a market even a regulated one doctors and nurses still would be using their skills to help people harm themselves solely for money .<-->O
The resulting distrust and loss of professional standards is too a high price to pay to gamble on the hope that a market may secure more organs for those in need .<-->O
Indeed the oath to do no harm certainly is ethically and morally important to doctors .<-->O
But if by donating a kidney , a destitute person can not only help the recipient , but also use the proceeds to start a business and thereby lift himself out of poverty , isn t it a win-win ?<-->O
Who is really harmed ?<-->N
The solution to the organ donor shortage problem poses a fundamental moral question : who has sovereignty and of what ?<-->O
If a person owns his own body , then rich or poor , shouldn t he have the right sell his organs if he so chooses ?<-->O
On the other hand , is the sale of organs the commoditization of the poor ?<-->N
Is such a market system the thing that lies at the bottom of the slippery slope of moral decay ?<-->O
If so , is it possible that the donor shortage can be cured without such controversial measures as organ sales ?<-->O
Can the current system be fixed , or is it set up for failure ?<-->N
There is hope that scientific advances may eventually allow us to grow organs in the laboratory .<-->N
When that day arrives , none of the above questions will matter .<-->O
But that day is long in the future .<-->N
In the meantime , the death rate of patients on donor waiting lists will continue to rise .<-->N
As of now there is no legal market for organ transplants in the U.S. , nor do we have the presumed consent statute that s working so well in Spain .<-->O
With demand growing exponentially due to the new medical advances that keep us alive so much longer , the problem will only get worse .<-->O
Ultimately , some kind of change will have to come .<-->O
Here s to hoping that day arrives sooner rather than later .<-->N
Should We Legalize the Market for Human Organs ?<-->F
Organ transplantation is one of the chief glories of modern medicine .<-->N
But it 's a miracle tragically out of reach for many thousands of people whose lives might be saved .<-->O
There just are n't enough organs to go around .<-->O
About 75,000 Americans are on the waiting list for kidney transplants .<-->N
But in the coming year , just 18,000 will get them .<-->O
That 's only one in four .<-->N
It 's not as though the others will eventually get kidneys if they just wait , sustained in the meantime by dialysis .<-->O
In the next year , nearly 4,000 of those patients will die waiting .<-->N
At least 1,200 others will fall off the list because they develop complications that make them too sick to withstand a transplant .<-->O
Thousands more transplant candidates might be saved if more Americans signed organ donation cards , if more families consented to donation of their loved ones ' organs , and if medical personnel approached the families of potential donors more often .<-->O
But the supply of cadaveric organs has been disappointingly flat .<-->N
So in recent years , there 's been a push to persuade living Samaritans relatives , friends and even strangers to donate one of their kidneys .<-->O
That 's helped , but not enough .<-->N
The situation has sparked recent debate about what was once unthinkable paying people to donate organs .<-->O
Six experts recently tackled that emotional issue in an Oxford-style debate , the last of this season 's events in theIntelligence Squared U.S. series .<-->O
The proposition : `` We Should Legalize the Market for Human Organs . ''<-->N
By the end of the session , many of the `` undecideds '' were persuaded .<-->N
Before the debate , 29 percent were uncertain .<-->N
Afterward , that declined to 9 percent .<-->N
Those who favored buying and selling organs went from 44 percent to 60 percent .<-->F
But those opposed inched up only 4 points , from 27 to 31 percent .<-->N
The debate took place before a capacity crowd on May 13 at the Asia Society and Museum in New York City .<-->N
Ira Flatow , host of NPR 's Talk of the Nation : Science Friday , moderated .<-->N
Here are some highlights : Sally Satel , a psychiatrist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who received a kidney from a friend in 2006 , says : `` Despite decades and decades of public education about the virtues of organ donation , the waiting list just gets longer , and the time to transplantation just gets longer .<-->O
... It 's past time to face the fact that altruism is just not enough .<-->O
Many people need more of an incentive to give .<-->N
And that 's why we need to be able to compensate people who are willing to give a kidney to a stranger , to save a life .<-->O
... We are not talking about a classic commercial free-for-all , or a free market , or an eBay system .<-->N
We 're talking about a third-party payer .<-->N
For example , today you could decide to give a kidney .<-->N
You 'd be called a Good Samaritan donor .<-->N
... The only difference in a model that I 'm thinking about is where you go and give your organ , and your retirement account is wired $ 40,000 , end of story . ''<-->N
Amy Friedman , director of transplantation at SUNY Upstate Medical University and close relative of two transplant recipients and one live organ donor , says : `` I agree with our opponents that the black market must be closed .<-->O
I disagree with asking patients to accept death gracefully , instead of resorting to the black market .<-->O
My position is that development of a legal , regulated mechanism for donor compensation is the only means of effectively eliminating the demand for this covert activity , closing down the black market and improving safety for donors and recipients .<-->O
... Compensation for the organ donor 's time and risks , by providing life insurance , lifelong health insurance and even a direct monetary fee , is more appropriate than for the donation of an egg , the rental of a uterus for a surrogate pregnancy , or the participation in clinical experimentation , all of which are legal . ''<-->O
Lloyd R. Cohen , professor of law at George Mason University , says : `` The market I propose is one in which healthy individuals might contract for the sale of their organs and tissue for delivery after their death .<-->O
If the vendors ' organs are retrieved and transplanted , a payment in the range of $ 5,000 for each major organ would be made to a person or institution chosen by the donor .<-->N
... In an options market , organs would only be acquired from the dead .<-->N
No one need be induced or even permitted to sacrifice his health or bodily integrity for money .<-->O
The donation of the organs of the deceased by both rich and poor is currently strongly encouraged , precisely because most of us believe that surrendering the organ represents no sacrifice to the donor . ''<-->O
James Childress , professor of ethics at the University of Virginia and chairman of the Institute of Medicine committee that produced the 2006 report `` Organ Donation : Opportunities for Action , '' says : `` There are strong reasons to believe that compensation for cadaveric organs wo n't increase the supply .<-->N
Imagine a futures market in organs where individuals contract to provide their organs after their deaths , and in return receive a payment now , or designate the payment to be provided after their deaths to their families or to a charity .<-->N
... Well , consider that many people do n't sign donor cards now because of distrust or mistrust .<-->O
They worry about being declared dead prematurely , or even having their deaths hastened , if they have signed a donor card .<-->O
Well , they would certainly be reluctant to enter a futures market , to sign a futures contract , when the only barrier to the delivery of their organs is the fact that they 're not dead yet . ''<-->O
Francis Delmonico , professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and adviser to the World Health Organization on transplantation , says : `` What we do here has a profound influence on the rest of the world .<-->N
Now , I say that because I 've been to Manila .<-->N
And ... it 's not a matter of balanced thought when a 14-year-old has to sell a kidney to an American that comes there .<-->O
It 's not a matter of balanced thought in Pakistan , or in Egypt .<-->O
... About 20 patients a month go from Israel to Manila because of cheap prices .<-->N
If there 's a market legalized in the United States , in the global context of medical tourism , do you think that the 72-year-old patient on the list would wait for a kidney here , versus going to buy a 20-year-old kidney in Manila ? ''<-->O
David Rothman , professor of social medicine at Columbia University and director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession , says : `` What this is really about is the sale of organs from living donors .<-->N
... There are very , very good reasons many drawn from behavioral economics , some drawn from past experience that suggest that , in fact , to create a market might diminish the supply , not increase it .<-->O
In the first instance , if I can buy it why should I give it ?<-->N
... In England , where the sale of blood was not allowed , rates of donation were considerably higher than the U.S. , where the sale of blood was allowed . ''<-->O
Should the sale of human organs be legalized ?<-->F
Organ transplantation is one of the main glories of modern medicine .<-->F
However , the number of patients who require organ transplants exceeds the number of organs available .<-->F
For example , the amount of Americans waiting for a transplant outnumbers the amount of donors by about four to one .<-->F
Every day , about 18 people die because they are waiting for an organ .<-->N
For some , the solution seems rather simple : allow the purchase and sale of human organs .<-->O
Proponents of the organs-for-sale scheme say that we have a moral duty to save lives and to reduce human suffering when it is in our capacity to do so .<-->O
Clearly , cash payments will increase people 's willingness to `` donate '' body parts , thereby increasing the supply .<-->O
One of the main objections of people who do not support the legalization of the sale of human organs is the idea that only the rich will be able to have access to organs -LRB- it might be even more difficult to obtain an organ because most donors would not want to donate for free if they could sell -RRB- .<-->O
Besides , allowing organs to be bought and sold would lead to the exploitation of the poor and ignorant , especially in third-world countries .<-->O
The Voice of Russia s Global Discussion community asked its members if it is morally acceptable to buy and sell human organs and if it would be fairer for people to be able to pay donors , which would save many more lives .<-->O
Most participants in the debate agree that organ transplantation is a great achievement of medicine : Joe McCully , United States - Organ donations save lives .<-->O
The dead can help the living and good people can help others through donations of things such as a kidney , lung , part of liver , along with non-organ donations such as bone marrow , and blood .<-->O
Perhaps transplant organs should have no market value .<-->N
But the idea that human organs could become a market asset causes repulsion .<-->O
The obvious reason is this would in fact legalize the deadly business of organ trafficking .<-->O
Mary Anthony , United States - Simple answer .<-->N
Reasons are obvious .<-->N
You create demands for a business related to human life .<-->N
The organ market has existed for a long time : Liliane Haupt Sotti , Brazil - Organ trafficking is the third most profitable illegal business in the world .<-->O
thousands of people around the world disappear .<-->N
The Black Market of Deep Web is already selling organs of pessos a long time .<-->N
Pakistan is legal to sell organs .<-->N
Kris Lerwill , United Kingdom - I think it could lead to some dangerous outcomes if you make it legal .<-->O
I 'm sure organized crime could find a way of supplying mass organs to the market - but the ways in which they obtain these organs could be very dark indeed .<-->O
It 's better to let people volunteer to offer their organs to save a life , than to sell organs for profits .<-->N
I could imagine desperate people who are poor being forced to sell their biology - this make me shiver .<-->O
Elena Indracusin , United States - I do n't think it is a good idea to sell organs .<-->O
Who do you think will sell the organs ?<-->O
Poor people of course , plus there is always a kidnapping and murder on a horizon .<-->N
It is already a billion dollars business and it is illegal can you imagine if it would be legal ?<-->O
With our health care and easy access to medical records anyone can be a target to be a potential donor .<-->O
One of the fears of organs becoming assets is that you might be confiscated a part of yours for unpaid debts : Richard Hackett , United States - I can see it all now ; legalized organ sales leading to seizure of your liver for unpaid debts .<-->O
The Organ market is just one more criminal enterprise that needs to be quashed .<-->O
It 's just too easy for those in power to turn a quick profit by harvesting from unwilling donors ... not just organs , but skin , bone , teeth , etc. .<-->O
Legalization of trade in human organs seems to inevitably lead to murder , however noble the declared intentions are : Gaby Olds , United States - When the time comes , my husband knows that my wishes are for my organs to be donated .<-->O
I 'm just saying I do n't trust doctors in those situations .<-->O
The whole organ thing to me is scary because so many children are being killed in 3rd world countries for their organs already .<-->N
If someone close to me needed an organ I would give it to them , but in no way could I ever justify accepting money for doing something like that .<-->O
Kareen Tamang , India - i would gladly give my organ to save a dear one if i have to , but i can not imagine my body parts as a money making thing to buy an iphone or a house or anything .<-->O
but as much as it is disgusting imagining someone selling their organs for such trivial things , what is scarier and more disgusting are the doctors who steals patients ' organs .<-->O
i can not even begin to write how sick and disgusting that is .<-->O
i personally know of a family that went through the painful ordeal ... and the worst part is that the doc is still free out there cos he had done his homework well and had all the necessary documents which he had obtained illegally .<-->O
such doctors are a disgrace to the medical fraternity and to humanity .<-->O
And , of course , if human organs get a market value , transplantation will become a privilege of the rich : Pedro Carvalho , Germany - If you make organ donation a free enterprise , then those with no health coverage and less money will not get it -LRB- I eye the USA -RRB- .<-->O
It will quickly become a thing of the rich .<-->N
It will create pressure to have organs available for transplant at any cost , probably leading to a wider use of death penalty .<-->O
In the end you have people transplanting organs just because they do n't like the way they look -LRB- enlarged liver , enlarged stomach , etc -RRB- .<-->O
It looks like 3D printing will come in to help with some organs , creating new organs out of stem cells from the patient .<-->O
So I think it should be a matter on a doner base as it has been so far .<-->O
For most of those who approve organ transplantation , voluntary donation is the only acceptable option .<-->O
Stephen K Davion , United States - we have to encourage people to volunteer to donate their organs when they die ... if all people volunteer themselves and reach the organizations who take the organs from the dead person who signed the agreement to donate the organs ... that will solve the problem of lack of organs ... However , some people reject transplantation at all : Ekaterina Blinova , Russia - The black market of organs in huge , enormous , they only need legalization today to increase the production .<-->O
I 'm against organ transplantation .<-->N
According to many religions a human should be buried with all his organs .<-->N
I think it 's right .<-->O
Organs can be cultivated and scientists should think about it .<-->N
Rick Boucher , United States - Your body fails ... you die !<-->N
The original plan works for me !<-->F
We were not born with zippers on our bodies .<-->N
On the other pole are those who support the sale of organs -LRB- in fact , only two participants in the discussion voiced this opinion -RRB- .<-->O
Dave Lovell , Canada - If it belongs to you do as ye wilt and harm none.Religion should have no say in this .<-->O
Science is God .<-->N
God , the force gave us science to unravel the riddles of God.We are the universe , rather a reflection of the universe.We reflect within each other .<-->O
And , again , a reservation : people should not be compelled to donate their organs to pay off their debts : Stephen Cobb , United States - Organ sales should be legalized -LRB- who owns my organs if not me ? -RRB-<-->N
, but organs should not be considered assets whose sale could be compelled to pay off debts .<-->N
Finally , an alternative view : growing organs seems to be an increasingly feasible alternative to donating them .<-->O
But doesn t it have its dangers ?<-->N
That s probably a topic for another discussion .<-->N
Douglas Baker , Canada - We 're almost to the point where we can create functioning organs from stem cells and other safe materials via 3D-printing . .<-->N
Bladders were being cultured and transplanted successfully up to ten years ago . .<-->N
This will be the organ market and will revolutionize medical treatment in this area .<-->O
Soon there will be no black market , as all organs will be free . .<-->O
Of course , governements will put a price tag on the process so they can steal what is rightfully ours !<-->O
I do n't think cost will be prohibitive , once the technology has been established .<-->O
It 's not so far for many things - in fact , bladders and other parts are already being successfully transplanted .<-->O
The only reason cost will be an issue is because governement and corporations will try to profit from it as much as possible .<-->O
Why Selling Kidneys Should Be Legal On Thursday , I will donate one of my kidneys to someone I ve never met .<-->N
Most people think this sounds like an over-the-top personal sacrifice .<-->O
But the procedure is safe and relatively painless .<-->N
I will spend three days in the hospital and return to work within a month .<-->N
I am 21 , but even for someone decades older , the risk of death during surgery is about 1 in 3,000 .<-->O
My remaining kidney will grow to take up the slack of the one that has been removed , so I ll be able do everything I can do now .<-->O
And I ll have given someone , on average , 10 more years of life , years free of the painful and debilitating burden of dialysis .<-->O
If kidney donation is this easy , why do the stereotypes about heroic sacrifice persist ?<-->O
Part of the problem is history : before modern medical advances , organ donation used to be quite painful and dangerous .<-->O
But organ donation advocates also deserve some of the blame .<-->O
In a misguided attempt to make the families of brain-dead patients consent to the posthumous donation of their organs , advocates treat donors like saints .<-->O
But deifying donors only serves to make not donating seem normal .<-->N
When I first told some friends and family that I wanted to donate a kidney , they assumed I d gone off my rocker .<-->N
They saw it as a crazy act of self-sacrifice , rather than what it is one of the many ways a reasonably altruistic person can help others .<-->O
This is a serious problem , because there aren t nearly enough saints in the country to tackle the growing waiting list for a kidney .<-->O
More than 34,000 people joined the waiting list in 2010 ; fewer than 17,000 received one .<-->N
Thousands of people die waiting each year .<-->F
This is a tragedy , but it doesn t have to be this way .<-->N
The people waiting for kidneys aren t dying because of kidney failure ; they re dying because of our failure without Congress s misguided effort to ban organ sales , they would have been able to get the kidneys they desperately needed .<-->O
It has been illegal to compensate kidney donors in any way since 1984 .<-->N
The fear behind the law that a rich tycoon could take advantage of someone desperately poor and persuade that person to sell an organ for a pittance is understandable .<-->O
But the truth is that the victims of the current ban are disproportionately African-American and poor .<-->N
When wealthy white people find their way onto the kidney waiting list , they are much more likely to get off it early by finding a donor among their friends and family -LRB- or , as Steve Jobs did for a liver transplant in 2009 , by traveling to a region with a shorter list -RRB- .<-->O
Worst of all , the ban encourages an international black market , where desperate people do end up selling their organs , without protection , fair compensation or proper medical care .<-->O
A well-regulated legal market for kidneys would not have any of these problems .<-->N
It could ensure that donors were compensated fairly most experts say somewhere in the ballpark of $ 50,000 would make sense .<-->O
Only the government or a chosen nonprofit would be allowed to purchase the kidneys , and they would allocate them on the basis of need rather than wealth , the same way that posthumously donated organs are currently distributed .<-->O
The kidneys would be paid for by whoever covers the patient , whether that is their insurance company or Medicare .<-->N
Ideally , so many donors would come forward that no patient would be left on the waiting list .<-->O
In the end , paying for kidneys could actually save the government money ; taxpayers already foot the bill for dialysis for many patients through Medicare , and research has shown that transplants save more than $ 100,000 per patient , relative to dialysis .<-->O
Sale of human organs should be legalised , say surgeons Leading surgeons are calling for the Government to consider the merits of a legalised market in organs for transplant .<-->N
A public discussion on allowing people to sell their organs would , the doctors say , allow a better-informed decision on a matter of such moral and medical significance .<-->O
At stake are the lives of thousands of people who may die before a suitable donor can be found .<-->N
Eight thousand people are on the transplant waiting list , more than 500 of whom die each year before they obtain an organ , and the numbers are rising by 8 per cent a year .<-->N
But there are serious concerns that introducing payments for people who donate their organs would result in poor and vulnerable people coming under severe pressure to alleviate their financial problems by selling a part of their body .<-->O
Professor Nadey Hakim , a Harley Street surgeon , and one of the world 's leading transplant surgeons , believes that a properly regulated market should be permitted so that the black market in organs is , if not destroyed , at least dramatically reduced .<-->O
He sees the effects of the black market in patients so desperate to have a transplant operation that they travel abroad for an organ .<-->O
This `` transplant tourism '' , he said , often results in botched operations requiring further surgery when the patient returns to Britain .<-->N
It would make better sense for organ sales to be allowed in the UK under a strictly regulated regime , he said , adding : `` Let 's have a system that does n't allow organs with HIV or whatever . ''<-->O
Professor John Harris , an ethicist at the University of Manchester , believes a debate and the introduction of an organ market are long overdue .<-->O
`` Morality demands it , '' he said .<-->N
`` It 's time to consider it because this country , to its eternal shame , has allowed a completely unnecessary shortage for 30 years .<-->O
Thousands of people die each year -LSB- internationally -RSB- for want of organs .<-->N
That 's the measure of the urgency of the problem .<-->N
`` Being paid does n't nullify altruism doctors are n't less caring because they are paid .<-->N
With the current system , everyone gets paid except for the donor . ''<-->N
Professor Harris has developed proposals for an ethical market in organs in which donors would be paid as part of a regulated system .<-->N
Such a system , he said , would have to be controlled within a strictly defined community , probably the UK but possibly extended to the EU , so every organ could be accounted for .<-->O
No imports would be allowed .<-->N
The NHS would be the sole supplier and would distribute organs as it does other treatments ability to pay would not be a factor .<-->O
Consent would be required for every donation and would have to be rigorously carried out to ensure no donor was subjected to untoward pressure .<-->O
Professor Sir Peter Bell , former vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons but now retired from practice , wants a public debate because there is such a shortage of organs for transplantation : `` It is time to debate it again .<-->O
There is a great shortage of organs . ''<-->N
Recent medical advances , he said , now make it reasonable to allow a kidney market and perhaps the sale of liver donations , although other body parts remain too risky , he argued .<-->O
`` If someone wants to alleviate a financial problem why should n't he do that ?<-->O
It 's his choice , '' he said .<-->N
Professor Bell suggested a fee of 50,000 to 100,000 for each kidney , the equivalent of one or two years on dialysis , and added : `` Kidney donation has now become so safe it 's something you could ethically justify and it would stop all this illegal trafficking . ''<-->O
There remains stiff opposition to liberalising the market , not least from the British Transplantation Society -LRB- BTS -RRB- .<-->O
Opponents agree there should be a public debate about the merits and flaws of a market in organs .<-->O
`` The British Transplantation Society opposes this view , however it is prepared to debate this issue as the theoretical and empirical literature evolves , '' said a spokesman .<-->O
Keith Rigg , the transplant surgeon and BTS president , said : `` I 'm happy to debate it .<-->O
There are pros and cons .<-->N
I think the trouble is it would require a huge change in public opinion and legislation .<-->O
One argument against a regulated market is if you are paying some people , what would be the impact on the existing deceased donor programme and living donor programme ? ''<-->O
Mr Rigg pointed out that in the last two years there has been a steep rise in donations , especially from live donors which have now overtaken deceased donors in number .<-->O
There were 1,058 live donations in the last year compared to 959 from dead patients .<-->N
With an average of 2.75 organs from each donor , surgeons were able to carry out 3,700 transplants in the last year .<-->N
Mr Rigg fears that introducing a regulated organ market would attract paid donors at the expense of voluntary donors .<-->O
Other opponents to the creation of a market in organs say it would cross major ethical barriers and there are less radical measures that could be looked at first .<-->O
`` I do n't believe we should be commercialising parts of our bodies , '' said Professor Anthony Warrens , Dean of Education at The London School of Medicine and Dentistry , adding that `` the most disadvantaged '' people would end up selling parts of their bodies , potentially with disregard for the risks involved .<-->O
`` It 's just very risky if it 's legalised , '' said Kenneth Boyd , professor of medical ethics at the University of Edinburgh .<-->O
A radical extension to the organ transplant programme is being launched by the Government , bringing fresh hope to hundreds of desperately ill patients .<-->O
In a boost to the existing programme , hospitals will retrieve organs from patients who die in accident and emergency departments as well as from those who die in intensive care units , as is currently the case .<-->O
The move is expected to make hundreds more organs available to reduce the waiting list .<-->N
Figures show that 28 per cent of the population has signed up to the organ donor register , but only 1 per cent die in circumstances where their organs can be used .<-->N
A&E departments lack the equipment and trained staff for the task .<-->N
Should we be allowed to sell our organs ?<-->N
Yes * It would boost the supply of organs helping to solve the national shortage * It would end the existing black market in organs , making it safer for people to donate * It would mean donors were paid like everyone else doctors , nurses , transplant co-ordinators involved in transplantation .<-->O
No * Encouraging people to sell parts of their bodies is morally wrong and would almost certainly lead to exploitation of the poor .<-->O
* Potential donors would be more likely to conceal conditions or illnesses that might rule them out .<-->O
* It would undermine the existing altruistic donor programme .<-->O
Organ transplants in numbers 2,017 Number of donors in the UK last year , of whom 1,058 were alive , and 959 were dead 3,698 Total number of organs transplanted last year , excluding corneas 1,482 Number of kidneys transplanted last year from deceased donors .<-->N
1,038 came from living donors 17.7 m Number of people on the organ donor register 7,892 Total number of people waiting for a transplant .<-->N
Of those , 6,741 are waiting for a kidney 1,000 + Number of people waiting for an organ transplant who will die before one becomes available 6 .<-->N
Should people be allowed to sell their organs ?<-->N
How much would it take for you to consider selling your bone marrow ?<-->O
A U.S. appeals court puts the price at about $ 3,000 in a ruling that now makes it legal to pay donors for their bone-marrow tissue .<-->N
The court 's decision may well help thousands of sick patients who need bone-marrow transplants to survive , but it also begs the question , What other body parts might next be up for sale ?<-->O
The ruling came about at the end of 2011 , in a decision to an October 2009 lawsuit brought by a group of cancer patients , parents and bone-marrow-donation advocates against the government over the federal law banning the buying and selling of bodily organs .<-->N
The plaintiffs were led by Doreen Flynn , who has three daughters who suffer fromFanconi anemia , a blood disorder that requires bone-marrow transplants to treat .<-->O
Flynn and the other plaintiffs said that too many such patients die waiting for transplants and argued that we should be allowed to pay people to donate their marrow as a way of ensuring a more reliable supply .<-->O
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed .<-->N
Time.com : Facebook now lets organ donors tell their friends At the core of the plaintiffs ' argument was the National Organ Transplantation Act -LRB- NOTA -RRB- , which since 1984 has forbid the buying and selling of human organs , including bone marrow .<-->O
But new developments in bone-marrow extraction have made marrow donation not much different from donating blood .<-->N
Traditionally , bone-marrow donation required anesthesia and long needles to extract the marrow from the hip bones of donors .<-->N
Now , a technique called peripheral apheresis allows doctors to extract blood stem cells directly from the blood , instead of the bone -- patients first take a drug that pulls stem cells from the bone and into the blood -- meaning that the marrow cells should be considered a fluid like blood , rather than an organ , the plaintiffs argued .<-->O
NOTA does n't prohibit payments for blood or other fluids , such as plasma or semen .<-->O
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder decided not to ask the Supreme Court to review the appellate court 's decision , which would have been the next step in overturning it .<-->N
That means the ruling stands -- and that people can now be paid up to $ 3,000 for their marrow , as long as it is collected by apheresis .<-->N
In a concession to the spirit of NOTA , however , the compensation ca n't be in cash ; it needs to be in the form of a voucher that can be applied to things such as scholarships , education , housing or a donation to a charity .<-->O
While the decision applies only to the nine states covered by the Ninth Circuit court , and only to bone marrow obtained through apheresis , it does raise bigger questions about how we will look at organ donation in the future .<-->O
With about 114,000 people waiting for organs in the U.S. alone on any given day , and only 3,300 donors , the urgent medical need runs up against moral standards of the value of human life .<-->O
Once we start paying for the parts we need , though , how far do we go ?<-->O
`` We do n't allow people to buy and sell human beings , that 's slavery , '' says Dr. Robert Klitzman , director of the bioethics program at Columbia University .<-->N
`` Should we allow people to buy and sell human body parts ? ''<-->N
Time.com : Where do -LRB- some -RRB- babies come from ?<-->N
In Washington , a new law bans anonymous sperm and egg donors Of course , certain body parts are already up for sale .<-->F
Aside from sperm and plasma , donors can also be paid for their eggs and hair .<-->N
But by expanding that list , the court 's ruling reopens the long-standing ethical debate over the commercialization of human tissues .<-->O
For now , legally `` sellable '' human body parts are n't ones that could be used to cure fatal diseases , which prevents a market frenzy .<-->O
But if the bone-marrow case starts changing that -- and experts say it could -- it might jump-start a dangerous trend in which lower-income groups were disproportionately targeted or incentivized to give up their marrow and people with rarer blood types demanded more money for their valuable cells .<-->O
Still , the benefits of compensating people for providing cells like bone marrow -- which the body replaces and which involves a relatively safe extraction -- may be wide-reaching , as Flynn and the plaintiffs argue .<-->O
`` In some sense , this is a policy experiment , and it could potentially be groundbreaking , '' says Jeffrey Kahn , professor of bioethics and public policy at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics .<-->O
`` If we compensate donors who give by apheresis and more people end up receiving -LSB- blood - -RSB- stem-cell transplants , maybe we should think about this for other kinds of donations . ''<-->O
Already , he points out , there is international trade for other organs .<-->N
Websites allow people to find matching donors for kidneys , for example -LRB- people are born with two kidneys , but can live with one -RRB- , and U.S. patients travel to developing nations to obtain transplants .<-->N
There is n't supposed to be compensation , but it 's hard to regulate such exchanges .<-->O

Could the U.S. be far behind ?<-->N
Nevertheless , selling tissues or organs may not be the logical first step in addressing the disconnect between supply and demand .<-->O
Klitzman notes that there are other changes we can make to U.S. organ-donation policy that might improve giving rates .<-->O
In Spain , for example , all citizens are organ donors by default ; those who do n't wish to participate must opt out .<-->O
In the U.S. , in contrast , people must voluntarily opt in to give , which could be a deterrent .<-->O
Even within such systems , there are incentives that can entice donors .<-->N
In Israel , for example , family members of donors are given priority on the waiting list of organs should they need one .<-->O
`` To me , it 's not clear that the current decision means we should overturn NOTA , '' says Klitzman .<-->O
`` I personally think we should have the debate about whether there are creative ways of enhancing donation of organs . ''<-->O
Certainly , if the goal is to improve the supply of much needed tissues without toeing an ethically troublesome line , those options are probably worth pursuing .<-->O
The Case for Legal Organ Sales How legalizing the trafficking of human organs would save lives and protect the poor Last month , 60-year-old Levy Rosenbaum pled guilty to trafficking in human organs , collecting more than $ 400,000 for arranging the sale of three kidneys .<-->O
He faces up to 20 years in prison and is the first person in the U.S. to be convicted of organ trafficking .<-->N
As the prosecutor in the case , New Jersey 's U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman , declared triumphantly : `` A black market in human organs is not only a grave threat to public health , it reserves lifesaving treatment for those who can best afford it at the expense of those who can not .<-->O
We will not tolerate such an affront to human dignity . ''<-->O
But before you condemn Rosenbaum completely , think about this : There are three people out there , who before they paid Rosenbaum to get them new kidneys , were sick and dying .<-->O
Now those same people are healthy and well .<-->N
Indeed , standing before U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson , Rosenbaum didn t sound like a bad guy at all , he sounded like a savior .<-->O
The son told me the father has kidney failure , Rosenbaum explained .<-->N
I helped him .<-->N
As kidney-donor Virginia Postrel sees it the Rosenbaum case is predictable .<-->N
This is exactly the situation the law was designed to prevent : a broker soliciting people to sell their kidneys .<-->N
It 's also exactly the situation the law creates : a broker getting a huge markup as a premium for breaking the law , rather than letting the donors receive an above-board price set by hospitals or insurers .<-->O
Harvard Economist Jeffrey Miron agrees : The law prevents a practice that benefits both the donors and the recipients , so it creates a large temptation to break the law .<-->O
But are Postrel and Miron actually suggesting that you could solve the black-market in kidneys if you just legalized sales , with prices determined by the market ?<-->O
Indeed they are ; they aren t alone , and with good reason .<-->N
Consider the sad data : There are 90,000 people waiting for a life-saving new organ .<-->N
Of those on the waiting list , there were only 17,000 transplants last year .<-->N
More than half of those were from dead donors -LRB- 10,500 -RRB- , with another 3,000 from living donors .<-->F
Meanwhile there were 28,000 names removed from United Network for Organ Sharing -LRB- UNOS -RRB- waiting list last year .<-->F
What happened to the other 11,000 patients ?<-->F
A significant number 4,600 were removed from the list because the patients died waiting .<-->N
And another 2,100 were deleted because the patient had become too sick to withstand a transplant .<-->O
The current average wait time for a transplant is 3.5 years .<-->N
So there s incredible demand for kidneys but there just aren t enough donors .<-->O
And one more technical matter : Transplants from live donors are more successful than transplants from dead donors .<-->O
The National Kidney Foundation says about 94 percent of kidneys transplanted from cadavers are still functioning well at one year after surgery .<-->N
But the results are even better for kidneys transplanted from living donors .<-->O
One year after surgery , 98 percent of those kidneys were still functioning well .<-->N
Given the current situation , therefore , there s a thriving black market for kidneys .<-->O
But if you imagine that Rosenbaum s $ 136,000 kidneys were transplanted into recipients in some back-alley , think again .<-->O
The procedures all happened at reputable hospitals , Rosenbaum 's attorneys said in a statement .<-->N
According to Bloomberg , was procedure was done at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore .<-->N
As Postrel notes , in this case there were no horror stories about people 's health being harmed The only harm was financial the recipients paid much higher prices for the kidneys than they would have without the premium for breaking the law and the donors probably received a lower price than they would have in an above-board system .<-->O
Miron argues that a regulated , legal market would actually lower the cost per kidney because the donation pool would be expanded .<-->O
But that s what Dr. Francis Delmonico , a transplant surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Medical Director of the New England Organ Bank , is worried about .<-->N
Delmonico acknowledges the kidney shortage , but he says legalizing the system will only end up exploiting the poor .<-->O
Sellers are disadvantaged because they don t really need to sell their organs , they need money , he argues .<-->O
Delmonico believes that any free-market system of selling kidneys would never be contained within , say , the United States , but rather would explode throughout the world where any regulation would simply not be enforced .<-->O
The sellers , therefore , would be exploited , and would primarily come from the poorest countries , selling their organs to the highest bidder out of desperation .<-->O
But Professor Nadey Hakim , transplant surgeon at St Mary 's Hospital , London , argues that not legalizing sales could be an even bigger problem .<-->O
`` As this trade is going on anyway , why not have a controlled trade where if someone wants to donate a kidney for a particular price that would be acceptable ?<-->O
If it is done safely , the donor will not suffer . ''<-->N
And Sir Peter Bell , professor of surgery at the University of Leicester , suggests that compensatory payments should be made to relatives who donate the kidney of a family member , as a way of staving off the growing trade in organs from the developing world .<-->N
One of Delmonico s colleagues meanwhile has a plan to regulate kidney sales .<-->N
Arthur J Matas , medical director of kidney transplants at University of Minnesota Medical Center argues that there can be a viable legal system with many of the same terms and precautions as the current voluntary system .<-->O
According to Matas plan the donor would get paid by the government or insurance company ; the selection of who gets a transplant could still be done by a UNOS-type system ; all donors would be fully evaluated -LRB- as they are now -RRB- , and a legal system would include oversight , long-term follow-up , and treatment of the donor with dignity and appreciation for providing a lifesaving gift .<-->O
Matas says the payment could be a fixed sum and/or include term life insurance , long-term health insurance , reimbursement for travel expenses and time out of work , or a tax deduction .<-->N
Matas makes one other important point about cost .<-->N
Because dialysis is so much more expensive than a transplant , paid donation could be cost-neutral to the health care system .<-->O
What the debate comes down to is whether or not one believes in the power of markets .<-->O
Public policy experts and the public at large will also have to get over their revulsion at the thought of selling organs to the highest bidder .<-->O
Why Legalizing Organ Sales Would Help to Save Lives , End Violence Last month , New Yorker Levy Izhak Rosenbaum pled guilty in federal court to the crime of facilitating illegal kidney transplants .<-->O
It has been deemed the first proven case of black market organ trafficking in the United States .<-->N
His lawyers argue that his lawbreaking was benevolent : `` The transplants were successful and the donors and recipients are now leading full and healthy lives . ''<-->O
Indeed , why are organ sales illegal ?<-->N
Donors of blood , semen , and eggs , and volunteers for medical trials , are often compensated .<-->N
Why not apply the same principle to organs ?<-->N
The very idea of legalization might sound gruesome to most people , but it should n't , especially since research shows it would save lives .<-->O
In the United States , where the 1984 National Organ Transplantation Act prohibits compensation for organ donating , there are only about 20,000 kidneys every year for the approximately 80,000 patients on the waiting list .<-->N
In 2008 , nearly 5,000 died waiting .<-->N
Many protest that an organ market will lead to unfair advantages for the rich , but this is a characteristic of the current trade .<-->O
A global perspective shows how big the problem is .<-->O
`` Millions of people suffer from kidney disease , but in 2007 there were just 64,606 kidney-transplant operations in the entire world , '' according to George Mason University professor and Independent Institute research director Alexander Tabarrok , writing in theWall Street Journal .<-->O
Almost every other country has prohibitions like America 's .<-->N
In Iran , however , selling one 's kidney for profit is legal .<-->N
There are no patients anguishing on the waiting list .<-->N
The Iranians have solved their kidney shortage by legalizing sales .<-->N
Many will protest that an organ market will lead to exploitation and unfair advantages for the rich and powerful .<-->O
But these are the characteristics of the current illicit organ trade .<-->N
Moreover , as with drug prohibition today and alcohol prohibition in the 1920s , pushing a market underground is the way to make it rife with violence and criminality .<-->N
In Japan , for the right price , you can buy livers and kidneys harvested from executed Chinese prisoners .<-->N
Three years ago in India , police broke up an organ ring that had taken as many as 500 kidneys from poor laborers .<-->N
The World Health Organization estimates that the black market accounts for 20 percent of kidney transplants worldwide .<-->N
Everywhere from Latin America to the former Soviet Republics , from the Philippines to South Africa , a huge network has emerged typified by threats , coercion , intimidation , extortion , and shoddy surgeries .<-->O
Although not every black market transaction is exploitative -- demonstrating that organ sales , in and of themselves , are not the problem -- the most unsavory parts of the trade can be attributed to the fact that it is illegal .<-->O
Witnessing the horror stories , many are calling on governments to crack down even more severely .<-->O
Unfortunately , prohibition drives up black-market profits , turns the market over to organized crime , and isolates those harmed in the trade from the normal routes of recourse .<-->N
Several years ago , transplant surgeon Nadley Hakim at St. Mary 's Hospital in London pointed out that `` this trade is going on anyway , why not have a controlled trade where if someone wants to donate a kidney for a particular price , that would be acceptable ?<-->O
If it is done safely , the donor will not suffer . ''<-->N
Bringing the market into the open is the best way to ensure the trade 's appropriate activity .<-->O
Since the stakes would be very high , market forces and social pressure would ensure that people are not intimidated or defrauded .<-->O
In the United States , attitudes are not so casual as to allow gross degeneracy .<-->O
Enabling a process by which consenting people engage in open transactions would mitigate the exploitation of innocent citizens and underhanded dealing by those seeking to skirt the law .<-->O
The most fundamental case for legalizing organ sales -- an appeal to civil liberty -- has proven highly controversial .<-->O
Liberals like to say , `` my body , my choice , '' and conservatives claim to favor free markets , but true self-ownership would include the right to sell one 's body parts , and genuine free enterprise would imply a market in human organs .<-->O
In any event , studies show that this has become a matter of life and death .<-->O
Perhaps the key to progress is more widespread exposure to the facts .<-->O
In 2008 , six experts took on this issue is an Oxford-style debate hosted by National Public Radio .<-->N
By the end , those in the audience who favored allowing the market climbed from 44 to 60 percent .<-->N
Yet , the organ trade continues to operate in the shadows and questionable activities occur in the medical establishment under the color of law .<-->N
Even today , doctors sometimes legally harvest organ tissue from dead patients without consent .<-->N
Meanwhile , thousands are perishing and even more are suffering while we wait for the system to change .<-->N
The truly decent route would be to allow people to withhold or give their organs freely , especially upon death , even if in exchange for money .<-->O
Thousands of lives would be saved .<-->N
Once again , humanitarianism is best served by the respect for civil liberty , and yet we are deprived both , with horribly unfortunate consequences , just to maintain the pretense of state-enforced propriety .<-->O
Is it ever right to buy or sell human organs ?<-->N
A leading medical think-tank , The Nuffield Council for Bioethics in London , is currently examining this thorny issue .<-->N
They are due to report their findings in 2011 .<-->N
In the meantime we have asked two experts to argue the case for and against .<-->N
We d love you to take part in The Argument , a new feature in the magazine in which a different issue is debated each month .<-->N
We ll be printing a selection of your comments on the debate below next month - read the contributions from the two experts and join the conversation at the bottom of the page .<-->N
We d prefer you to use your real name , but want to hear what you have to say either way .<-->O
The global organ shortage has spawned illegal and unregulated organ markets .<-->N
The World Health Organization estimates that five to ten per cent of all kidneys transplanted annually perhaps 63,000 in total are obtained in the organ bazaars of Africa , Asia , Eastern Europe and South America .<-->N
Thus , we face a dual tragedy : on one side , thousands of patients who die each year waiting for a kidney ; on the other , a human rights fiasco in which corrupt brokers deceive indigent donors about the nature of surgery , cheat them out of payment and ignore their post-surgical needs .<-->O
Altruistic appeals to organ donation have not yielded enough organs for transplantation .<-->N
Not all developed countries have made the most use of posthumous donation , and of course they should .<-->N
Unfortunately , much of the world transplant establishment including the World Health Organization , the Transplantation Society and the World Medical Association focuses exclusively on obliterating organ trafficking .<-->N
While at face value this may seem reasonable , in reality it is a lethally one-sided prescription , because trying to stamp out underground markets either drives corruption further underground or causes it to flourish elsewhere .<-->O
Government-sponsored compensation of healthy individuals who are willing to give one of their kidneys to save the life of a dying stranger is the best short-term solution .<-->O
So we start on common ground : illegal and unregulated organ markets are reprehensible consequences of individuals driven to seek transplantation therapy .<-->O
The tragedy has played out across the world .<-->N
The drive for survival is a very strong human instinct and one that overcomes feelings and common bonds between people .<-->O
It overthrows decency and humanity and it requires consequentially strong and united laws and regulations .<-->O
I must leave the country tonight because they are shooting my donor tomorrow , was said by a patient to one of my colleagues recently .<-->N
Such opportunistic human cannibalism has no place in healthcare .<-->N
Organ donation after death is the only practicable solution for heart , lung , pancreas , intestine , composite tissue and most liver recipients .<-->O
There can be no solution that ignores the reality of people with these needs .<-->N
By focusing on kidneys alone , where the solutions must embrace both the deceased and the living donor , you seem to have discarded the broader needs for transplantation .<-->O
I thus seek more from you than a throw-away line on the need to make the most use of posthumous donation .<-->O
salley Satel Let me say a few words about myself .<-->N
In August 2004 I became one of those whose drive for survival became very strong .<-->O
That s when I learned I had idiopathic renal failure .<-->N
After a year of searching for a donor among people I knew well and coming up empty a casual -LRB- but now very dear -RRB- friend stepped in to spare me years of life-draining dialysis and premature death .<-->O
I am well aware of my good fortune .<-->O
Many people without a donor are failing on dialysis , and some have no access to dialysis at all .<-->N
And they will follow that survival instinct to foreign lands , despite the sickening knowledge that their new organ might come from an executed prisoner in China or an illiterate labourer in India .<-->O
I , for one , had considered it .<-->N
Your reference to opportunistic human cannibalism took me aback .<-->N
The tragedy we face is symmetric : hapless donors and wretched patients are locked in a morbid embrace .<-->O
I outlined one model for disentangling them a government-regulated programme of in-kind benefits to well-informed donors , offered by a third party and distributed to the next ill person , not the wealthiest .<-->O
What innovations have you offered ?<-->N
I realize that most types of organs must come from deceased donors .<-->N
But let s be realistic about the extent to which deceased donation can help .<-->N
You tell of Chinese prisoners who are shot for their organs .<-->N
This horrific practice is precisely the kind of extreme situation that takes place when there is no legal alternative .<-->O
If anything , it is an argument in favour of safe and legal means of rewarding donors .<-->O
Developed countries must enlarge the pool of transplantable organs , by rewarding living and posthumous donors , if they are to keep some of their citizens from becoming reluctant participants in organ trafficking .<-->O
Voluntary and compensated live donation for kidneys and deceased donation -LRB- compensated or not -RRB- can and should exist side by side .<-->N
Jeremy Chapman Deceased donor programmes are the central issue for organ donation .<-->N
In your country -LSB- the US -RSB- deaths on the roads alone are capable of meeting the needs of your population ; in China there are 79,000 deaths each year on the roads .<-->N
Harnessing the existing unavoidable mortality is sufficient to meet the needs if the scientific and social requirements to retrieve those organs are resolved .<-->O
The system of both blood and organ donation that provides the best protection for both the donor and the recipient is altruistic gifting .<-->O
The moment that money is introduced to buy a kidney from a vendor , the nature of the exchange and the motivation changes , and with that change come dangerous consequences for both parties .<-->O
The donor changes , since those driven by money are the poor and the vulnerable in the community .<-->O
The altruistic , related living-donor evaporates since the recipient can simply buy a kidney and recipients would rather put someone else at risk than their own family .<-->O
The deceased donors evaporate , since there is no government drive for deceased donation ; and the liver , heart and lung recipients simply die .<-->O
I have just described -LSB- the situation in Iran -RSB- the only country in which there is regulated organ sale .<-->N
This is not a hypothesis , but a proven fact .<-->N
Sally Satel I agree that countries can and should make better use of deceased donation .<-->O
But even in Spain , which has the world s highest deceased donation rate , individuals continue to die waiting .<-->N
Even non-renal organs , which are in lesser demand than kidneys , are not produced in adequate numbers , according to the Spanish National Transplant Organization .<-->O
As for the US , you are mistaken .<-->N
Of the roughly two million Americans who die annually , only 10,500-13 ,000 possess organs healthy enough for transplanting .<-->N
Meanwhile , 85,000 Americans are waiting for kidneys .<-->N
I challenge your assertion that deceased donation evaporates when patients can obtain their organs from compensated donors .<-->F
In Iran the government began compensating living kidney donors in 1988 and since then the waiting list for kidneys has dwindled .<-->N
Yet Iran also established a deceased programme to increase the supply of livers , hearts , and lungs in 2000 .<-->N
Before passing a law allowing deceased donation , less than one per cent of kidney transplants came from deceased donors , but by 2007 this had risen to 16 per cent .1 Altruism , while a glorious virtue , is simply not enough .<-->O
You have succumbed to the straw man argument that giving an organ for free is noble but doing so in exchange for material gain is a sordid affront to human dignity .<-->O
This is a false choice .<-->N
Transactions on a black market are dangerous because they are illicit , not because they are transactions .<-->O
There is a fertile middle ground on which to establish safe , legal programmes that protect donors who would be happy to accept enrichment for saving the life of another .<-->O
Humanitarian and financial motives intertwine all the time .<-->N
Are we any less grateful to the firefighters who rescue us because they are salaried ?<-->O

Jeremy Chapman You should take a long hard look at those 85,000 people who are registered in the US organ transplant system a large number are never deemed fit enough actually to be transplanted by the listing transplant programme .<-->O
Some 2,700 kidneys were discarded in the US last year so the first place to make changes is in the efficiency of US systems .<-->N
Many ethical and trusting individuals like you , who advocate for buying organs , resolve the undoubted reality of abuse of the poor by the rich by using the reassuring words safe and legal .<-->O
It is easy to minimize the conceptual consequences using words but so much harder in reality .<-->O
Let us take the example of the Philippines here the trade in organs flourished until 2008 .<-->N
The vendors were poor people living in the slums and making a living off the waste tips of Manila and Quezon City .<-->N
The kidney broker lives in the only brick home in the slum from which he extorts the kidneys , for a sum of money similar to his fee .<-->N
The then president of the Philippines decreed the purchase of organs illegal .<-->F
This led to a drop in the number of transplant tourists .<-->F
In Australia , by getting organized nationally , we are witnessing a 30 per cent rise in deceased organ donation this year and a rise in living kidney donation .<-->F
The Transplantation Society , working with the Spanish National Transplant Organization and World Health Organization has derived a programme to achieve the changes you ask for .<-->N
I can not give you the recipe in a simple email , but if you visit these shores I can show you or you could look on www.donatelife.gov.au Our job now is to assist the emerging economies of the world to do the same and not to rely on solutions that further entrench the disadvantages of poverty .<-->O
Should It Be Legal to Sell Organs ?<-->F
Year after year , the number of kidney donations is insufficient to save the lives of thousands on the waiting list for transplants .<-->N
Some argue that the problem cold be solved by offering financial incentives to donors , but others counter that an organ market would exploit the poor and dehumanize the sellers .<-->O
There are more than 80,000 people in the U.S. on theUnited Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network kidney transplant waiting list .<-->N
Little more than 13,000 kidneys are donated either by living or deceased donors each year , not nearly enough to provide kidneys for all those on the list .<-->N
Last year , 16,517 people received kidney transplants , while 4,530 people died , though 1,600 of them were too sick to receive a possible transplant .<-->O
There is an international black market for organs that flourishes in many Third World countries and preys on the poor and desperate .<-->O
The buying and selling of organs in the United States is banned under the1984 National Organ Transplant Act , and medical organizations are united in their opposition to it .<-->N
There are , however , some doctors and ethicists who argue that a legal , regulated organ market would help solve the shortage of donor kidneys and save lives .<-->O
Opinion & Analysis : Legalizing the sale of organs Sources in this Story o Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network : Data o UC Berkeley : Organs Watch o United Network for Organ Sharing : National Organ Transplant Act -LRB- PDF -RRB- o HOD Society -LRB- Kidney International -RRB- : Payment for donor kidneys : Pros and cons -LRB- PDF -RRB- o Reason : The Case for Selling Human Organs o Harvard University Gazette : Ethicists , philosophers discuss selling of human organs o The Atlantic : With Functioning Kidneys for All o Santa Clara University : Issues in Ethics : Kidneys for Sale Advocates of legal organ selling say that a financial incentive would increase the number of organ donations by healthy individuals or the families of the deceased .<-->N
Writing in a 2005 edition of Kidney International , Drs. Eli and Amy Friedman say that as many as 100,000 people could be saved annually by introducing a regulated kidney market .<-->N
Introducing appropriate legalization to regulate and manage kidney sales through a national regulatory body would be a natural extension of the present end stage renal disease network collaborating with United Network for Organ Sharing and the OPTN , they write .<-->O
Eliminating black market brokers would divert funds to kidney sellers .<-->N
Money saved by decreasing the number of dialysis patients might fund additional kidney transplants .<-->O
It should be noted , writes Ronald Bailey for the libertarian journal Reason , that in the United States we already have robust markets for blood , semen , human eggs and surrogate wombs .<-->O
Extending markets to include non-vital solid organs such as kidneys and pieces of liver , which can be obtained with reasonable safety from living donors , is not such a stretch .<-->O
However , many object to an organ market because it would exploit the poor .<-->O
Even in a regulated , government-run version of transplant tourism , unethical realities lead to exploitation of the poor and the vulnerable , argued Harvard Medical School professor Francis L. Delmonico at a 2008 Harvard symposium on the issue .<-->O
Virginia Postrel , writing in The Atlantic , contends , A well-designed system could address the concerns about donor welfare by including educational programs , waiting periods , and follow-up care for donors , and possibly by allocating the payments over time rather than offering immediate cash .<-->O
Delmonico also contends that a market will virtually destroy altruism and deceased donations , citing examples in Iran , Hong Kong and Israel .<-->N
Postrel counters , Some volunteers would undoubtedly drop out , relieved to let someone else provide their loved one s new kidney .<-->O
But real incentives , rather than token rewards , would produce a net increase in the number of transplants .<-->O
Harvard ethicist Nir Eyal said at the sympsosium that , though buyers and sellers would benefit in the trade of an organ , there was a potential for an organ market to cause dignitary harm to the organ donors and stigmatize the poor communities from which the majority of donors would come .<-->O
Claire Andre and Manuel Velasquez , in a 1988 issue of Issues in Ethics , took a similar stance : We will have to choose between two sets of moral values : the value we place on preventing death and alleviating suffering , and the value we place on respect for human dignity and our commitment to meeting human needs in a fair and equitable manner .<-->O
Should Animal Testing Be Banned ?<-->N
Animal experimentation has been a commonly debated subject for many years , is it cruelty or science ?<-->N
About 1.4 million animals die each year from animal testing .<-->N
This is because of harsh ways animals are treated like by their experimenters .<-->O
Animals should be free of the cruelty scientists expose them to because they have just as much sentient as humans do .<-->O
I think animal testing is cruelty more than science .<-->O
Animals are not treated well and are often abused by their handlers .<-->N
Small animals share a shoe box sized cage with at least eight other small animals .<-->N
That s no way to live .<-->N
Imagine stuffing eight human beings into a regular sized bedroom .<-->F
Where are you all going to sleep or get dressed ?<-->N
Not easy right ?<-->O
Animals will be held down by metal bands or locked in small cages with a hole cut out for the animals head to be trapped into , so they can not move around and be a hassle while being tested on .<-->O
An ats lab in North Carolina stuffs monkeys in tubes .<-->N
Another harsh thing handlers do is take out dog s vocal chords so they don t disturb the lab workers .<-->O
As for death to an animal ; the experimenters will euthanize the animal after being tested on or will use the animal again for further testing until they are dead or useless .<-->O
If you don t believe the cruel ways animals are treated , go on youtube and search for : PLRS : undercover at a product - testing lab .<-->O
Animals are not just objects .<-->N
They have feelings and can think , just like us humans do .<-->O
Rene Descartes , a French philosopher and scientist , said people have the right to use animals just as if they were machines .<-->O
The more similar the animal is to a human the more intelligent and sentient the animal is , so the more immoral and wrong it is to use the animal as a biological object .<-->O
Descartes also believed only humans have feelings and could think .<-->O
If this were true animals wouldn t flinch and whimper when needles are injected in them or when testers put drops of cologne in the animals eye .<-->O
Scientists use animals for testing products to make humans lives better right ?<-->O
That s what I thought too .<-->N
Well , many experiments that were approved to be available to human beings have later been recalled for safety issues or harmful side affects .<-->N
Is animal testing very reliable ?<-->N
If products have to be withdrawn from stores and human use , then that in it self should say something .<-->N
Can we trust that animals will have the same reactions to a product as a human would ?<-->O
Not at all , if we get shampoo in our eyes we immediately know to rinse it out and we re fine .<-->O
Animals don t know that and are not used to such products .<-->N
Therefore animals will have different reactions to things we can easily fix .<-->O
A mouse and a human being are not the same and will react differently to different things .<-->N
We don t expect a human to live in a cage its whole life .<-->N
We don t expect a mouse to brush its teeth and know not to swallow the toothpaste .<-->N
Many everyday products like toothpaste and soap do not have to be tested for .<-->N
Companies that make those products and cosmetics however do use animals for testing and it s completely unnecessary .<-->O
There are other ways to test without animals .<-->N
One process is called the Neutral Red Uptake Assay in which jelly like substances called cultures are put into a glass case then human cells are placed in the culture .<-->N
Chemicals that are being tested are added to the dish .<-->N
The human cells will either live or die .<-->N
The cells react by changing a different color .<-->N
Researches analyze the color with a computer .<-->N
The computer can calculate how likely a chemical is to kill human cells .<-->N
There are also artificial organs , eyes , and skin that react just like the real thing would .<-->O
Plants and bacteria can be used as well .<-->N
Doctors can also analyze humans without hurting them by examining what they do on a daily bases .<-->N
In 1951 Britain doctors showed a link between smoking and lung cancer by examining people who smoke compared to people who don t. No animals or humans are harmed or killed during any of these tests .<-->N
Many people argue that testing on animals is the most efficient way to know that our products are safe .<-->O
They argue that animals produce much faster then humans do so why not take a few of the animals ?<-->O
Those animals are less important and valuable then human beings anyways right ?<-->O
Author Peter Singer says Humans are animals too , and we must respect other species .<-->O
And I agree fully .<-->N
Other arguments are that using animals is the cheapest way ; the other experiments are not as accurate as animals and that using animals have been beneficial to human life .<-->O
Now I m not going to say that it hasn t been helpful but there could have been other alternatives .<-->N
After what I have read , yes I am very against animal testing .<-->O
Yes , animal testing is cruelty and in a lot of cases not necessary .<-->N
I do use stuff that probably has been tested on animals but did it really have to be ?<-->N
Like perfume , in a test , called the Draize Eye test , scientists spray perfume into a rabbit s eye .<-->N
Rabbit s eyes do not easily wash away irritating substances unlike humans eyes do .<-->N
Animals are not use to the everyday stuff human s use , so of course animals will react much differently than humans will .<-->O
Animals are not meant to use perfume , soap or any other everyday object human s use , so why test on them ?<-->N
This to me and many others is very cruel and wrong .<-->O
Save America s animals before it s too late .<-->N
------- ANIMAL TESTING SHOULD BE BANNED Creatures may be being tortured and killed for the shampoo you use , food you eat , the makeup you may wearing , the cleaner used in your home , or medication you may take .<-->N
Millions of animals a year are subject to being imprisoned and having terrible procedures done .<-->N
This includes trials such as vivisection -- the act of cutting or experimenting with live animals or having harsh chemicals used on them that you would never dare to put anywhere near your hair or face .<-->O
Many of animals used die from these sorts of practices .<-->N
Yet , a Pew Research poll found that only 43 percent of adults surveyed oppose to the use of animals in scientific research .<-->N
Although the fact of the matter is that animal testing not only is unethical and cruel , but also is dangerous and can avoided .<-->O
100 million animals are killed for research each year in the United States alone .<-->N
So it is surprising how few laws there are to protect those animals .<-->N
In fact , the only law that regulates animal testing is the Animal Welfare Act -LRB- AWA -RRB- .<-->N
Unfortunately , the law does not place any restrictions on the types of experiments scientists may enact .<-->N
The rules of the law -LRB- enforced by the US Department of Agriculture -RRB- also don t apply to mice and rats , which account for ninety percent of all animals experimented on .<-->F
Not only do the animals die in research , but also abused during the entire process .<-->N
All kinds of animals , including mice , birds , rats , fish , frogs , dogs , monkeys , rabbits , guinea pigs , and hamsters are subject to cruel experimentation in the name of science .<-->N
Creatures used in experimentation are deprived of everything that would seem natural to them .<-->O
They are confined to empty cages for hours at a time and caused social isolation , and psychological trauma .<-->O
The animals may be ordained to breathing in toxic fumes , have caustic substances injected into their eyes , or confined to devices that render the animals immobile for hours at a time .<-->N
Even worse is that just before their deaths creatures may get their skin burned off or their spinal cords smashed .<-->O
Animal testing is not just dangerous to the animals tested on , but to humans as well .<-->O
Pat Thomas of The Ecologist said many of the drugs approved through animal experimentation have proven dangerous to humans .<-->N
In order to make experimentation more accurate , scientists should rely on human cells and carefully conducted clinical trials with humans .<-->N
In the book Naked Empress : The Great Medical Fraud prominent researcher Hans Ruesch adds that approximately 15,000 new drugs are marketed every year , while some 12,000 are withdrawn .<-->N
Animal testing may not be as accurate as it appears when it comes to the health of the American people .<-->N
According to the Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- 1.5 million Americans were hospitalized in a single year due to pharmaceutical drugs given to `` cure '' them .<-->N
30 percent of those hospitalized suffered further harm from the therapy they were prescribed .<-->N
The reason that animal testing is causing so much harm to humans may be because of the unreliable results animal testing produces .<-->O
Dr. Richard Klausner , a former director of the National Cancer Institute said `` We have cured mice of cancer for decades , and it simply did n't work in humans . ''<-->N
The journal of Annals of Internal Medicine disclosed that universities often exaggerate results from animal experiments conducted in their laboratories as well as `` often promote research that has uncertain relevance to human health and do not provide key facts or acknowledge important limitations . ''<-->O
Of the drugs tested on animals , ninety-two percent of them do not make it through Phase 1 of human clinical trials -LRB- the initial tests that find out the reaction , effectiveness , and side effects of doses of a potential drug -RRB- .<-->O
Testing on animals is an issue that their obviously needs something to be done about .<-->N
Luckily there are several steps that , if taken , can eradicate all the repercussions in general .<-->N
By encouraging companies to use less harmful ingredients , and most importantly getting consumers to buy cruelty free products , we can reach the point where animal testing can be banned altogether .<-->O
Persuading companies to use less harsh chemicals in their products is a logical step toward ending animal testing .<-->O
The only reason that humans would suffer more harshly by testing products first hand would be because of harsh chemicals used in most of the products in America .<-->O
According to the Environmental Encyclopedia Synthetic chemicals are widely used in industry , agriculture , and in the home ; many resist complete enzymatic degradation .<-->N
The government could persuade companies to use more natural , and less harmful ingredients in their products by offering tax breaks for the companies who do .<-->O
As a result of making more natural products , the environment would also be benefitted by having less toxins going throughout our society .<-->O
More jobs could also be provided to individuals willing to undergo such trials once the industry maintains more credibility .<-->O
This kind of radical action can not happen without the support of you the consumers .<-->O
In an article in America magazine An online listing of companies that test on animals is shockingly long , and the brand names are surprisingly familiar -- including Clairol , L'Oreal , Pine - Sol , Scope , Old Spice and Woolite .<-->O
Just by buying products that haven t used animal testing such as T he Body Shop , Avon , and Mary Kay cosmetics , you are taking a stand against animal testing .<-->O
If enough people refuse to use products that have been tested on animals , then it is entirely possible to amass enough support to have the government ban animal testing altogether .<-->O
America is a country of innovators .<-->N
Countless new products are created each year with an innumerable amount of purposes .<-->N
There were ways to avoid animal testing in the creation of all of those commodities .<-->N
It is truly up to you , the consumer ; to decide which ones you want to support the makings of by buying .<-->O
That shampoo you use , food you eat , the makeup you may wearing , the cleaner used in your home , or medication you may take , shouldn t be responsible for any innocent creature s harm .<-->O

Poisoning , shocking , burning , and killing animals is all in a day s work for vivisectors .<-->N
If these atrocious acts were committed outside laboratories , they would be felonies .<-->N
But animals suffer and die every day in laboratories with little or no protection from cruelty .<-->O
Here are the top five reasons why it needs to stop : 1 .<-->N
It s unethical to sentence 100 million thinking , feeling animals to life in a laboratory cage and intentionally cause them pain , loneliness , and fear .<-->O
It s bad science .<-->N
The Food and Drug Administration reports that 92 out of every 100 drugs that pass animal tests fail in humans .<-->N
It s wasteful .<-->N
Animal experiments prolong the suffering of people waiting f or effective cures by misleading experimenters and squandering precious money , time , and resources that could have been spent on human-relevant research .<-->O
It s archaic .<-->N
Forward - thinking scientists have developed humane , modern , and effective non-animal research methods , including human-based microdosing , in vitro technology , human-patient simulators , and sophisticated computer modeling , that are cheaper , faster , and more accurate than animal tests .<-->O
The world doesn t need another eyeliner , hand soap , food ingredient , drug for erectile dysfunction , or pesticide so badly that it should come at the expense of animals lives ------------ Animal Testing Should be Banned Welcome to this debate : `` animal testing should be banned '' .<-->O
I as pro define animal testing as experimenting using the lives of animals or harming animals in any way .<-->N
I define banned as completely abolishing taking lives or harming animals in tests or experiments .<-->N
Animal testing is certainly a disgrace , and should be banned .<-->O
It firstly is fairly unreliable .<-->N
Animals do n't have the same body systems as us , and what might be good for them may not have the same great effect on us .<-->O
It has been proven that 92 percent of experimental drugs -LRB- that 's 9 in 10 ! -RRB-<-->N
that are safe and effective in animals fail in human clinical trials because they are too dangerous or don `` t work .<-->O
This means that the animals died for a cause that did n't even work out .<-->N
Animal testing can even delay research because of its unreliability .<-->N
Cosmetics , drugs , and other animal tested products can also cause health problems due to unreliability .<-->N
Secondly , it is a barbaric way of researching .<-->N
It is just trial and error on animals .<-->O
Animals ' lives are treated like dirt , and while they ca n't talk , they still have rights .<-->O
Approximately 19.5 % are killed every year in research .<-->N
This is absurd !<-->N
Innocent animals are dying , and 9 in 10 animals die for a product that does n't even work .<-->N
Also , cures for many diseases and medical conditions like stroke and asthma , have made little progress over the past century , yet have used excessive animal testing in experiments .<-->O
Testing is often painful , and includes many sickening ways of completing experiments , like pouring drain killer into the eyes of animals , or rubbing chemicals on shaved skin .<-->O
You bet .<-->F
Most of these experiments are n't used with any sort of painkiller .<-->F
A lot of animals ' lives are thrown away .<-->N
This must stop .<-->N
Finally , there are kinder alternatives to experiment , and animal testing is hardly necessary .<-->N
It is n't necessary due to technological advances and more effective treatments .<-->N
Doctors are now starting to use other methods which are far more effective and reliable than animal testing .<-->N
We can now discover the root causes of diseases , so more action can be taken .<-->N
Studies of human patients using sophisticated scanning technology -LRB- for example , MRI , FMRI , PET , and CT -RRB- have prevented mental disorders in the brains of people .<-->O
Other scans and screening methods are also used to prevent big diseases .<-->N
Even skin model testing has been proven to work .<-->N
These alternatives to animal testing have are more effective and more reliable than animal testing .<-->N
Animal testing just is n't right and should definitely be banned because it : Is unreliable Is cruel Is n't necessary due to technological advances and more effective treatments We must ban animal testing right away .<-->O
I would like to thank Pro for starting this debate .<-->O
In this debate , I will challenge Pro 's resolution `` Animal Testing Should be Banned '' .<-->O
Pro has presented three reasons why we should ban animal testing , I will refute them one by one .<-->O
1 / Animal testing is unreliable Pro claimed that `` 92 percent of experimental drugs that are safe and effective in animals fail in human clinical trials because they are too dangerous or do n't work '' .<-->O
This is very misleading and it does n't prove anything .<-->O
We use animal testing to find the drugs potentially dangerous to human .<-->N
Those that pass the test are not automatically safe but they are less likely to be dangerous than the ones that were discarded thanks to the test .<-->O
Let 's imagine something like this : 1000 drugs need to go through two tests .<-->O
900 fail the first test and only 100 are allowed to take the second test , then 92 fail and only 8 pass .<-->N
So 92 % of the drugs which pass the first test fail the second test .<-->N
Does it mean the first test is useless ?<-->O
Obviously not .<-->N
The fact is animal testing has contributed greatly to the medical progress .<-->O
It helps us in our fight against cancer , HIV/AIDS , heart disease , diabetes , Parkinson `` s disease , birth defects , ... -LSB- 1 -RSB- 2 / Animal testing is barbaric This argument is very emotion-based .<-->O
The fact is we should and we must put the our own benefit over other species .<-->O
Animals are killed in order to make drugs for human .<-->N
So what ?<-->F
Animals are also killed to be consumed by human .<-->F
What is wrong with that ?<-->N
Human right is above animal right .<-->O
Pro talks about the animals ' pain .<-->N
But how about the pain of the people tormented by diseases ?<-->O
If animal testing helps saving human lives then there is no reason to stop it .<-->N
3 / There are alternatives The alternatives to animal testing are even more unreliable .<-->N
I would like Pro to elaborate about `` other methods which are far more effective and reliable than animal testing '' .<-->O
The scanning technology only helps us to find the cure , but after we make the cure we still need to test it .<-->O
So it is not an alternative .<-->N
Regarding the skin model , the original quote from Pro 's source is `` Human skin model tests are now in use , including the validated EpiDerm '' test , which has been accepted almost universally as a total replacement for skin corrosion studies in rabbits . ''<-->N
-LSB- 2 -RSB- It is the replacement for specific studies , how can it replace testing drugs in animals ?<-->N
Thank you con for an interesting argument .<-->N
However , some of your points are unworthy .<-->N
I would like Pro to elaborate about `` other methods which are far more effective and reliable than animal testing '' .<-->O
Ok then , you asked for it .<-->N
Here it is directly from the source : `` Scientists at private companies , universities , and government agencies are developing new cell and tissue tests , computer models and other sophisticated methods to replace existing animal tests .<-->N
These alternatives are not only humane ; they also tend to be more cost-effective , rapid , and reliable than traditional animal tests . ''<-->O
-LRB- 1 -RRB- Now , do you want me to `` elaborate '' some more , or can you see the point ?<-->O
Regarding the skin model , the original quote from Pro 's source is `` Human skin model tests are now in use , including the validated EpiDerm '' test , which has been accepted almost universally as a total replacement for skin corrosion studies in rabbits . ''<-->N
-LSB- 2 -RSB- It is the replacement for specific studies , how can it replace testing drugs in animals ?<-->N
The skin test is just one specific example I used .<-->O
There are many more alternatives which are safer than animal testing , like examining blood donations -LRB- saves hundreds of thousands of rabbits and humans yearly -RRB- , the Reduced Local Lymph Node Assay -LRB- a skin sensitization test -RRB- , The 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity Test -LRB- A complete replacement for Phototoxicity animal tests -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- , The Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test and Isolated Chicken Eye Test -LRB- uses the eyes of animals already killed for meat , so no new animals are killed , and no part of the already-slaughtered animals are put to waste -RRB- , the Embryonic Stem Cell Test -LRB- a differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- , the use of leftover human skin from surgery is be used to measure the rate at which a chemical is able to burn the skin -LRB- 5 -RRB- , and more alternatives to testing .<-->O
So what ?<-->N
Animals are also killed to be consumed by human .<-->F
So that 's your point , is it ?<-->F
That torturing animals is ok , because people eat meat already ?<-->N
That 's a very unthoughtful argument .<-->N
What con is pretty much saying here , is that when animals die for meat and food , it 's suddenly alright for 19.5 MILLION more animals to die unnaturally and in pain .<-->O
We kill enough animals for the food industry , without more dying through experiments .<-->O
However , The Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test and Isolated Chicken Eye Test uses the eyes of animals already killed for meat , so no new animals are killed , and no part of the already-slaughtered animals are put to waste .<-->N
So the meat truly is n't wasted .<-->N
`` 92 percent of experimental drugs that are safe and effective in animals fail in human clinical trials because they are too dangerous or do n't work '' .<-->O
This is very misleading and it does n't prove anything .<-->O
What this statistic is really saying , is that what worked in animal trials actually failed later on .<-->O
It 's sort of like pulling a lever on a slot machine .<-->N
Every now and again , the winning combination will appear .<-->N
What the statistic is also saying , is that it 's unreliable .<-->N
If if there were 100 products that WORKED in testing , then 92 will fail later on , and a mere 8 will pass .<-->O
Alternatives to animal testing are far more reliable , and are n't nearly as cruel .<-->N
We use animal testing to find the drugs potentially dangerous to human .<-->N
Animal testing is not all jolly and saving human lives with medicine .<-->N
Animal testing is used countlessly for cosmetics and toiletries .<-->N
It 's not worth it , for there to be a blind monkey for a new line of mascara .<-->N
While you may be thinking animal testing is all about saving lives , it is n't .<-->N
Millions of animals die each year in pain because of the make-up industry .<-->N
Human right is above animal right .<-->O
Who says ?<-->N
What makes us so important that innocent animals must be tortured , then murdered , so people can enjoy the benenfits ?<-->O
What 's ok about humans killing bunnies , but so horrible about rabbits killing babies ?<-->N
I 'll leave that question with you , con .<-->N
But how about the pain of the people tormented by diseases ?<-->O
While diseases are horrible , they 're at least a natural way of dying - no MURDER involved .<-->O
The animals taken in by testing have been killed way before their time has come .<-->N
Con is saying in this sentence , that the pain of people `` tormented '' by diseases , a natural way of dying , needs to be stopped by torturing hundreds of innocent animals , an unnatural and cruel way of dying .<-->O
Animal testing is also not all about saving lives .<-->N
The alternatives to animal testing are even more unreliable .<-->N
What sort of research went into that statement ?<-->N
When finding what chemicals irritate skin , comparing alternative tests to animal tests , the animal tests had a 40 % error rate , whereas alternative testing correctly showed all the chemicals .<-->O
A replacement for the LD50 Test had an accuracy rate of 84 % , while the animal test had an accuracy rate of 52 % -LRB- 7 -RRB- .<-->N
Other tests have been proven to be more reliable .<-->N
Now , I 'll back up the points I made in R1 : 1 .<-->N
Animal Testing is Unreliable I 'll start this argument off with a quote I found : There is no doubt that the best test species for humans are humans .<-->O
It is not possible to extrapolate animal data directly to humans due to interspecies variation in anatomy , physiology and biochemistry .<-->N
- MacLennan & Amos .<-->F
Clinical Science Research -LRB- 7 -RRB- .<-->F
This quote sums up my point in a nut shell .<-->N
Animals have different bodies to ours , and are unreliable .<-->N
In fact , 52 % of the new drugs marketed in the US between 1976 and 1985 caused adverse reactions that were not predicted by animal studies -LRB- 2 -RRB- .<-->O
This just shows the unreliability .<-->O
Animal Testing is Cruel Let me start by saying that this is not exactly opinionated like con said .<-->O
It does n't take a rocket scientist to realise that exposing a shaved rabbit to 24 hours of burning is cruel .<-->N
Animal testing is cruelty to animals .<-->N
The animals used are even common pets like hamsters , rabbits , cats and dogs !<-->N
Testing on animals mainly is n't about saving lives either ; millions of animals yearly are put to death so humans can show off their new make-up .<-->O
It 's vile !<-->N
There are Alternatives There are many alternatives which are safer than animal testing , like : Examining blood donations the Reduced Local Lymph Node Assay The 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity Test The Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test the Chicken Eye Test -LRB- uses meat already killed from the meat industry -RRB- the Embryonic Stem Cell Test the use of leftover human skin from surgery LD50 alternative test And more These alternatives are more cost efficient , more reliable , and reduces toxic waste .<-->O
These alternatives are extremely important , and helps reduce animal testing drastically .<-->O
Now it 's clear that animal testing must be banned .<-->N
It 's unreliable , cruel , and unnecessary .<-->O
Over to you , con .<-->N
1 / Animal testing is unreliable Pro insisted that `` If if there were 100 products that WORKED in testing , then 92 will fail later on , and a mere 8 will pass '' .<-->O
He ignored my point that just because the products pass the first test and fail the second test , does n't mean the first test is useless .<-->O
My argument stands : This does n't prove that animal testing is unnecessary and should be abolished .<-->O
Pro said that the alternatives are far more reliable , I said : Prove it .<-->N
Show me that less than 92 % of the products passing those alternatives fail in human clinical trials .<-->N
Pro said that `` Animals have different bodies to ours , and are unreliable '' .<-->N
It is incorrect .<-->N
Many animals have similar DNA to human , such as pigs share 98 % of human genes -LSB- 1 -RSB- or mice share 99 % .<-->N
-LSB- 2 -RSB- Thanks to the genomic revolution , we have realized that there are much more similarities between humans and animals than there are differences .<-->N
Genomic knowledge has made it so that animal research can be much more specifically targeted and accurate when representing a human , thus correctly predicting a how a human will react .<-->O
-LSB- 3 -RSB- For example mice are actually considered the best model of inherited human diseases .<-->O
-LSB- 3 -RSB- Pro said that `` There is no doubt that the best test species for humans are humans '' .<-->O
While it is true , we ca n't use human experiment -LRB- that 's why we need animal testing before human clinical trials -RRB- .<-->O
If Pro consider `` human cell '' of `` human skin '' as `` human '' then it 's just ridiculous .<-->O
Such models can not tell us what the likely effect of a drug will be on blood pressure - because neither of these things has a circulatory system , blood , heart , ... or they could predict how a drug might be metabolised without introducing it to an organism with a liver .<-->O
We must trial drugs on whole living organisms at some stage .<-->N
-LSB- 4 -RSB- Pro said that `` 52 % of the new drugs marketed in the US between 1976 and 1985 caused adverse reactions that were not predicted by animal studies '' .<-->N
It 's 30 years ago .<-->N
It does n't prove that animal testing is unreliable now .<-->N
2 / Animal Testing is Cruel There is no difference between killing animals for food and killing animals for drugs .<-->N
In both cases animals die unnaturally and in pain .<-->O
It 's hypocrisy to say one case is OK while the other is not .<-->N
Pro questioned my point that `` Human right is above animal right '' .<-->O
Is n't that obvious ?<-->N
Right is a concept created by human .<-->N
Why should we give other species more rights than us ?<-->N
Therefore it 's totally OK for us to `` murder '' animals for our own benefit -LRB- by the way I also want to remind Pro that `` killing animals '' does n't count as `` murder '' -LSB- 5 -RSB- -RRB- .<-->O
On the other hand , what Pro suggested is we should save animals ' lives and leave sick people to die in pain because it 's natural .<-->O
This kind of reasoning is absurd .<-->O
Pro said that animal testing is not only for making drugs and saving human lives , but also for cosmetics and toiletries .<-->N
This is irrelevant .<-->N
While animal testing is not always about saving lives , it does save lives in many cases .<-->N
Just because it does n't save lives in other cases , does n't mean we should ban it as a whole .<-->O
Pro could have just suggested the ban of animal testing for cosmetics and toiletries , however , his resolution is to abolish all kinds of animal testing .<-->O
Proving that animal testing for drugs should n't be banned is enough for me to win this debate .<-->O
3 / There are Alternatives Pro mentioned cell/tissue tests and human skin model tests .<-->N
I said above that such models can not replace the whole body and `` we must trial drugs on whole living organisms at some stage '' .<-->O
Pro presented various examples of the alternatives .<-->N
However , he only showed that some specific non animal tests can replace some specific animal tests .<-->N
In order to abolish animal testing , he must show that all kinds of animal testing -LRB- or at least most of them -RRB- can be replaced .<-->O
In Round 1 , I have said that animal testing `` helps us in our fight against cancer , HIV/AIDS , heart disease , diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , birth defects , ... '' .<-->O
I would like Pro to present the alternatives for the experiments for such diseases .<-->O
He ignored my point that just because the products pass the first test and fail the second test , does n't mean the first test is useless .<-->O
This is just a statistic to back up my argument of unreliability .<-->O
Out of 100 , only 8 pass .<-->N
This is small .<-->F
There are more useful alternatives .<-->N
Many animals have similar DNA to human , such as pigs share 98 % of human genes -LSB- 1 -RSB- or mice share 99 % .<-->N
When it comes to DNA , every little percent counts .<-->N
Mice are furry , small , etc. .<-->N
There are many differences between us and mice , yet they still share 99 % of our genes .<-->F
It is the same with pigs .<-->N
The website even says that mice genomes are shorter than that of humans , bringing more differences .<-->N
Pro questioned my point that `` Human right is above animal right '' .<-->O
Is n't that obvious ?<-->N
Right is a concept created by human .<-->N
So animals can be killed whenever because there are no rights to protect them ?<-->N
That 's a horrible and unfair statement .<-->O
On the other hand , what Pro suggested is we should save animals ' lives and leave sick people to die in pain because it 's natural .<-->O
This kind of reasoning is absurd .<-->O
I do n't see how it 's absurd .<-->N
If the human is dying of a disease , killing an animal who has a whole life ahead of it is cruel .<-->O
The human is dying of natural causes , while the animal is dying unnaturally .<-->O
helps us in our fight against cancer , HIV/AIDS , heart disease , diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , birth defects , ... '' .<-->O
I would like Pro to present the alternatives for the experiments for such diseases .<-->O
CELL CULTURE Using leftover cells from surgery , scientists can now research them and grow them .<-->F
In 1996 a team based at Uppsala , Sweden , compared animal test data , human experience and the results of cell culture tests for a range of chemicals .<-->N
Their aim was to discover whether animals or cell culture were better predictors of what happens in humans .<-->N
The cell culture results were found to be significantly more accurate .<-->N
Cell culture can help birth defects and the National Cancer Institute favours cell culture over animal testing .<-->N
COMPUTERS Computers can detect the safety of drugs more accurately than animals .<-->N
They can create 3D models to help scientists with testing and research .<-->N
MICROORGANISMS Microorganisms can be used as indicators of drugs being harmful .<-->N
The Trust 's research into diabetes successfully used a microscopic organism called Hydra , as an alternative to diabetic animals .<-->N

-LRB- 1 -RRB- There is no difference between killing animals for food and killing animals for drugs .<-->N
In both cases animals die unnaturally and in pain .<-->O
You ignored the point I made previously .<-->N
Just because animals die for meat , this does not mean we can just kill 19.5 m more animals .<-->O
we ca n't use human experiment While it is unethical to kill a human , taking blood samples and organ donations is far more reliable than animal testing .<-->O
-LRB- 1 -RRB- Thank you con for a great debate .<-->O
I rest my case .<-->N
1 / Animal testing is unreliable My point is the statistic Pro presented does not back up his argument of unreliability .<-->O
I will repeat my counter example in Round 1 here : 1000 drugs need to go through two tests .<-->O
900 fail the first test and only 100 are allowed to take the second test , then 92 fail and only 8 pass .<-->N
Just because 92 % of the drugs that pass the first test fail the second test , does n't mean the first test is unreliable .<-->O
Pro said 8 % is small .<-->N
Small compared to what ?<-->N
I asked him to show that `` less than 92 % of the products passing those alternatives fail in human clinical trials '' .<-->O
Pro had no answer .<-->N
Of course there are differences between human and animals .<-->N
But I 've already said in Round 2 , `` animal research can be much more specifically targeted and accurate when representing a human , thus correctly predicting a how a human will react '' and `` mice are actually considered the best model of inherited human diseases '' .<-->O
Pro did n't have any rebuttal to my arguments .<-->N
2 / Animal Testing is Cruel * -RRB- So animals can be killed whenever because there are no rights to protect them ?<-->N
That 's a horrible and unfair statement .<-->O
Why is it horrible and unfair ?<-->O
This is no argument , simply Pro 's opinion .<-->O
* -RRB- I do n't see how it 's absurd .<-->N
If the human is dying of a disease , killing an animal who has a whole life ahead of it is cruel .<-->O
The human is dying of natural causes , while the animal is dying unnaturally .<-->O
Putting animal lives above human lives is absurd .<-->N
It is completely unreasonable to sacrifice the lives of your own species to save the lives of other species .<-->O
* -RRB- You ignored the point I made previously .<-->N
Just because animals die for meat , this does not mean we can just kill 19.5 m more animals .<-->O
I did n't ignore anything .<-->N
Killing animals for drugs and killing animals for food is the same .<-->N
If it saves human lives then yes , we can kill 19.5 m more animals .<-->N
3 / There are Alternatives Pro made a grave mistakes .<-->O
He needs to show that the alternatives are better than animal testing .<-->O
Just making a long list of other methods is meaningless .<-->O
CELL CULTURE I 've already said in Round 2 that `` human cell '' is not `` human body '' and `` we must trial drugs on whole living organisms at some stage '' .<-->N
Pro said that `` the National Cancer Institute favours cell culture over animal testing '' .<-->N
It is false .<-->N
NCI uses animal testing a lot : `` If the drug shows promise , extensive testing in animals will determine whether it is effective and safe enough for testing in humans '' -LRB- http://www.cancer.gov ... -RRB- .<-->O

LIVER None of the sentences here states that this method is better than animal testing .<-->N
* -RRB- While it is unethical to kill a human , taking blood samples and organ donations is far more reliable than animal testing .<-->O
There is no where in Pro 's source states that `` taking blood samples and organ donations is far more reliable than animal testing '' .<-->N
Conclusion Pro is unable to prove that animal testing is unreliable and the other methods are better .<-->O
While maybe the animals are suffering due to the tests , it ca n't be helped if we want to save human lives .<-->O
So the BOP is not met , Pro has failed to show that `` Animal Testing Should be Banned '' .<-->N
As the last word I would like to thank Pro for the great debate .<-->O
------------- The Debate : Should testing on animals be banned ?<-->N
Animal welfare charities reacted angrily to news in July that the number of animal experiments rose to a record high in Britain last year a 40 per cent rise over the last decade .<-->O
Last month , Cardiff university defended sewing kittens eyes shut , as means to find a cure for lazy eyes .<-->N
In their statement , they said the purpose of the work and its conduct was approved by both the university s own ethical review process and the Home Office as part of the licensing process .<-->N
The 1990s saw a campaign to end cosmetics testing Europe-wide , and next year , Europe will introduce a ban on selling newly animal-tested cosmetics , for the first time excluding products that don t comply .<-->N
When it comes to scientific research , however , scientists have defended the use of experiments and said researchers were reducing the proportion of animals used per study at a time of rising funding for bio-sciences .<-->N
But should animals be used for scientific testing ?<-->N
Is it far removed from testing for beauty products ?<-->N
Or is the research required to help save human lives ?<-->N
Alistair Currie , PETA , argues that as 90 % of medicines tested on animals fails on humans , it s the fundamental problem of experimenting on different species as well as the ethical concerns that means we should stop any further testing on animals .<-->O
As a vivisectionist , Hugh Daley * defends the invaluable research gained , which adheres to stringent guidelines to minimize suffering and with increasingly complex health issues , restricting experimentation to unreliable alternatives -LRB- stem cell research -RRB- would hinder progress .<-->O
Which do you agree with ?<-->N
Alistair Currie : Animals are not ours to experiment on Animals are not ours to use for experimentation .<-->N
They feel pain and fear just as we do , and their overwhelming natural inclinations like ours are to be free and to protect their own lives , not to be locked in a small cage inside a laboratory , where they are subjected to abuse and suffering that would be illegal if they took place anywhere else .<-->O
No animal should ever face being genetically engineered to develop cancer , as mice are ; being intentionally paralyzed from brain damage , as monkeys are ; or being force-fed pesticides and other chemicals , as dogs are .<-->O
In addition to being unethical , animal testing is fundamentally flawed because it studies the wrong species and that is a scientific problem that can never be overcome .<-->O
Approximately 90 per cent of medicines that pass tests on animals fail in people , either because they aren t safe or don t work .<-->N
That s an enormous waste of money , animal lives , scientific resources and hope .<-->O
Scientific research may now finally be able to progress into the 21st century because the British public is demanding human-relevant , modern research techniques instead of obsolete and unreliable animal tests .<-->O
The development of cutting-edge non-animal methodologies that can accurately predict what happens in human beings involves exciting , progressive and effective science not to mention the fact that it is infinitely kinder to animals .<-->O
Increasingly , governments , companies and researchers themselves are recognising that the animal-testing model is broken and can never be fixed .<-->N
Why conduct painful and lethal tests on the wrong species when sophisticated computer and mathematical models , human tissue and cell cultures and smarter , more focused clinical and epidemiological studies can show us more accurately what happens to human bodies with diseases ?<-->O
The scientific community urgently needs to rethink its psychological dependence on cruel and unreliable animal tests and align itself with progressive thinking for a future filled with less suffering for all species .<-->O
Alistair Currie is a Policy Adviser for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in the UK .<-->N
Hugh Daley : It s not about torturing kittens for fun It s a truth universally acknowledged that the internet is made of kittens .<-->O
No surprise that when practices involving the use of kittens at Cardiff University were exposed , the Twitterati went into overdrive .<-->N
For an experiment on visual deprivation , scientists sewed one eyelid shut on each of a group of 31 kittens .<-->N
In response , Ricky Gervais tweeted Honestly , how does this happen in so called civilised society ? .<-->N
Petitions were raised , with one currently just over 20 000 signatures .<-->N
It was a perfect storm .<-->N
Confession time : I am a vivisectionist .<-->N
I am one of those evil scientists , torturing poor defenseless creatures .<-->N
I ve even worked very hard to get here ; after many years of medical school , I am now working towards a PhD .<-->O
Whilst I understand the unease many people feel about animal experimentation , I don t think it s given a fair hearing .<-->O
Clearly , vivisection has an image problem .<-->N
Kittens are cute !<-->N
When you read about that story , weren t you swayed by the picture ?<-->N
If this experiment was conducted on a less attractive animal -LRB- a naked mole rat maybe , or even a pig -RRB- would you mind as much ?<-->O
Nobody likes to see an animal in a cage , scientist-sanctioned or otherwise .<-->N
Understandably , animal testing will always be an emotive topic , but we should take care to not allow this to distract us from the core issue .<-->O
The issue is not whether the procedure was , on the face of it , cruel .<-->N
It was .<-->N
In and of itself , sewing any animal s eye shut is cruel .<-->N
However , it s whether the benefits gained from doing this outweigh the harm done , and whether these benefits could have been gained through testing on a lower animal , or even without testing on animals full stop .<-->O
I am confident that almost all animal experiments currently conducted in the UK are necessary .<-->N
In our work we carry out numerous animal procedures .<-->N
Many are terminal , so the animal never suffers -LRB- i.e. remains under anaesthesia until death -RRB- .<-->N
Some are not , often involving open-chest surgery and recovery from anaesthesia .<-->N
Everything is done to minimise suffering .<-->N
We give far better post-operative pain relief to these animals than you may find in a hospital .<-->O
It would have been the same for these kittens , with 24hr on-call veterinary advice and ample pain relief .<-->O
In short , everything is done in agreement with stringent ethics and guideline to eliminate unnecessary suffering .<-->O
Few people would think twice about taking their pets for treatment of a similar invasiveness at the local vet , with PETA happy to advocate neutering in the name of animal welfare .<-->O
At the crux , vivisection is necessary .<-->N
Cats -LRB- and rats -RRB- are not human , but we have more in common than not in our physiology .<-->N
Whilst much of the research will not directly lead to the next cure for cancer , for instance , it will provide invaluable groundwork on which to build .<-->O
Society faces increasingly complex health issues and research can not be mired by only using currently-unreliable alternatives -LRB- such as stem cells -RRB- .<-->O
Of course , this situation should be continually re-evaluated as alternatives improve , research should be as transparent as possible , and regulation must remain at the exceptionally high level it is today .<-->O
We as scientists should encourage open debate , educate the public and stand-up for our research .<-->O
So , instead of listening to a well-meaning celebrity on Twitter , take a step back and find out for yourself what vivisectionists do before giving it the all-too-easy Like or RT. .<-->N
Often it is not as simple as the headline would have you believe .<-->O

---------- Why Should Animal Testing be Banned The topic of whether animal testing should be banned is highly debatable and it draws out mixed reactions from people who support or oppose this activity .<-->O
However , a careful study of this subject reveals that claims supporting the merit of animal testing holds the least amount of credibility .<-->O
Let us find more on why should animal testing be banned through facts presented in this write up ... Read more at Buzzle : http://www.buzzle.com/articles/why-should-animal-testing-be-banned.html Actions of human beings , no matter how harmless they appear to be , have a great impact on the environment .<-->O
Even a seemingly passive act of littering rivers with waste materials leads to their clogging which over time turns into an irreparable damage .<-->O
The damage caused to environment due to animal testing and abuse is beyond our imagination .<-->O
Animal testing , as projected by the media does n't seem harmless .<-->N
However , the underlying truth of this activity is often hushed up by personnel in animal testing laboratories .<-->N
In today 's world , where technological aids can provide us with simulation results , the practice of animal testing can be avoided to some extent .<-->N
Due to sophistication in experiments , animal testing practices today , are less painful for the animals .<-->N
However , the fact remains that animals do suffer in such practices as they are made to undergo pain and face difficulty in adapting to the various changes their body undergos when experiments are conducted on them .<-->O
Reasons for Banning Animal Testing The activity of animal testing is of cruelty and sometimes unscientific .<-->N
Money spent on animal experimentation is wasted in many cases ; due to inability in obtaining accurate results , and all this at the cost of the animals ' well-being .<-->O
Here are a few arguments against animal testing that support the thought of banning this activity .<-->O
Cruel Practices Animals are a soft target for human beings ; it is however , not fair to take undue advantage of their helplessness .<-->O
It should be understood that a monkey or a mouse would experience the same amount of pain that human beings would do , on being made to undergo certain painful procedures .<-->O
Animals used for testing are often deprived of food , water and sleep .<-->N
In many cases they are treated cruelly .<-->N
For example , dogs are locked in gas chambers to test whether a particular insecticide is safe for inhalation by human beings .<-->N
Most often , anesthesia is not used at the time of testing .<-->N
A callous attitude towards the safety of animals is one of the main reasons for not using anesthesia when experimenting on animals .<-->O
Another reason for avoiding the use of anesthesia is the claim that test results get altered on doing so .<-->O
However , just imagine that you are being operated on without anesthesia or jammed in a cell just because someone else wants to know how your body reacts to that particular environment .<-->O
Only after being empathetic towards these creatures that you will realize what kind of pain these innocent animals have to bear during such experiments .<-->O
Fast Fact : Countries like New Zealand and Netherlands have banned the use of great apes and other primates for the purpose of testing .<-->O
Inaccurate Results The results obtained from animal testing are used to check whether a particular medicine or cosmetic product would have any side-effects on human beings .<-->N
The body systems of animals are different from those of human beings .<-->N
Aspirin is widely used for the treatment of fever , pain , inflammation , etc. in human beings .<-->O
However , this very medicine proves to be toxic for mice .<-->N
Most experiments are conducted on animals which can not be a reliable source for predicting results on human beings .<-->N
It means , the mice or rats are not the correct means to speculate reactions in human beings , while only monkeys and chimpanzees are ; they being closely related to humans .<-->O
Many of us do n't know that drug companies are not held accountable for illnesses or side-effects resulting from their medicines or vaccines ; however , it is a fact that many newly tested medicines they proudly sell , actually fail to give positive results .<-->O
The side-effects of drugs like thalidomide and clioquinol are testimony to the claim that medicines tested on animals can not be considered safe for human use .<-->O
Therefore , it is not correct to fully rely on results of tests conducted on animals .<-->N
Fast Fact : According to the National Institute of Health -LRB- NIH -RRB- , most of the vaccines -LRB- HIV/AIDS -RRB- which passed the animal tests , actually failed in trials that were conducted on human beings .<-->N
Costly Affair Rearing animals for the purpose of testing requires a lot of investment on feeding and fulfilling other needs .<-->N
Animals used for testing must be fed certain amounts -LRB- and specific type -RRB- of food , depending on what they are being tested for .<-->O
They require to be provided with shelter for the period for which they are experimented on .<-->N
Plus , there are huge expenses incurred in creating an artificial environment for the experiments and in conducting the tests on animals .<-->N
John McCain , a politician from USA has deemed the practice of animal testing as ethically , scientifically and financially unsound .<-->N
Animal testing statistics reveal that thousands of dollars are spent every year on animal testing and the activities cost the lives of millions of animals .<-->N
Fast Fact : According to Lexington Herald-Leader , a reputed media network , millions of tax-payer dollars are wasted on drug tests involving animals and they are pointless .<-->N
There are Alternatives ... In today 's world , many alternatives to animal testing have been developed , which is one logical reason why animal testing should be banned .<-->O
Tissue culture methods , for example can be used as alternatives to animal testing .<-->N
Crash test dummies -LRB- test devices which mimic humans -RRB- have internal sensors and they can be used for experimentation instead of torturing living animals .<-->F
Monoclonal antibodies can be created with the help of cultured cells .<-->F
Tissue engineering techniques can be used for culturing these cells .<-->N
It is also possible to make a model of the human immune system in order to check whether a particular vaccine is effective or not .<-->O
Such models are referred to as Modular Immune In Vitro Constructs -LRB- MIMIC -RRB- .<-->N
Fast Fact : Russell and Burch first developed a 3-Rs system that is based on the principles of finding alternatives to animal testing .<-->N
It stands for Replacement -LRB- using non-animal methods for experimentation -RRB- , Reduction -LRB- using lesser animals to obtain more information -RRB- and Refinement -LRB- refining procedures so as to reduce the pain and discomfort involved .<-->O
The practice of animal testing should be banned , considering that it is harmful from the ethical , environmental as well as the economical point of view .<-->O
Making use of alternatives that are available for animal experimentation is therefore , a better choice .<-->O
It is only by means of responsible and compassionate behavior towards animals that we can be called true ` human ' beings .<-->O
Progress in medicine is essential , but not at the cost of innocent lives .<-->N
As Mahatma Gandhi rightly said , `` You can judge a nation 's moral progress by how it treats its animals . ''<-->O
---------------- Animal Experiments Should not be banned Animal Experiments Should not be banned For many years , animals have been used in research both in the scientific and medical fields .<-->N
In order to introduce new drugs into the market , they have to be tested first on animals in order to ascertain whether they are effective or not .<-->N
Animal experimentation in this context defines the use of non-humans , mostly animals , to test new drugs and consumer goods such as cosmetics , pesticides , herbicides , food additives , among others -LRB- Taylor 120 -RRB- .<-->N
Pharmaceutical companies and research institutions have been active in animal experiments because these institutions are charged with coming up with new drugs .<-->N
What has however been controversial with animal experiments is whether this procedure should be banned or not based on its ethical implications .<-->O
Animal rights activists have been at the forefront in advocating for a ban on animal experiments based on the ethical issues associated with it .<-->N
For those supporting the use of animals in experiments , the arguments that have been made include possibilities of medical and scientific breakthroughs , safety for humans , and accuracy of results .<-->N
When the benefits of animal experimentation are weighed against the drawbacks , it is evident that the procedure is beneficial .<-->O
Accordingly , animal experimentation should not be banned .<-->N
First , animal experiments should not be banned based on the fact that it has been beneficial to humans and animals .<-->O
With the recent technological advancement , substantive accomplishment has been made in the field of human medicine and science .<-->N
In this regard , the use of animal testing can not be underestimated .<-->N
Taylor -LRB- 132 -RRB- maintains that animal experimentation has helped in unearthing new drugs that have helped to ease the suffering of humans from disease that was once witnessed in the past .<-->O
Blakemore support Taylors point by indicating that vaccines for polio and cervical cancer , insulin , antibiotics , heart-bypass surgery , among others were all advances that were achieved through animal testing .<-->O
For a patient to receive therapy or treatment , it has to be known that this originated from an arduous medical research involving animals .<-->N
For instance , Blakemore uses an example of how people can easily forget the importance of animals in medical research .<-->O
This is based on the fact that powerful drugs such as Avastin used to treat bowel , breast , and lung cancer were developed after research was conducted on mice .<-->O
John Stein , the professor of Oxford Functional Neurosurgery Group also supports animal experiments because it helps to improve medicines and treatments -LRB- Campbell -RRB- .<-->N
Some countries like the UK have even realized the benefits of animal testing in advancing the medical field -LRB- University of Bradford -RRB- .<-->O
However , UK has banned the use of animal testing for consumer goods such as for cosmetics production -LRB- University of Bradford -RRB- .<-->N
Critics have however been instrumental in indicating a number of ethical implications linked with animal testing .<-->O
As the critics point out , animal testing is a procedure that does not take into consideration the rights of animals .<-->O
As a matter of fact , animals are just like humans who require to be treated the way humans are treated .<-->O
While supporting animal research , Taylor -LRB- 120 -RRB- however cites some commentators who argue that the experiment that involved testing cosmetics and other hazardous products on rabbits in order to know how long the rabbits would die was unethical .<-->O
This experiment fundamentally was meant to test the level of toxicity of certain substances .<-->N
As Taylor -LRB- 128 -RRB- echoes the sentiments of critics , this is an inhumane way of treating animals because the suffering of any being ought to count equally with the like suffering of any other being .<-->O
These among other critical arguments have formed the basis of the opposing side of animal testing .<-->N
It may be justified to talk in terms of animal ethics when there is justification that animals have actually been mistreated .<-->O
Considering that few cases have been reported regarding inhumane treatment of animals , it should not however justify the lifting of a ban on animal testing .<-->O
As a matter of fact , animals have helped a great deal in the scientific and medical field which has equally improved the quality of human life .<-->O
From a practical perspective , the use of animal experiments guarantees the safety of humans .<-->N
In order to ascertain whether drugs and other consumer goods are safe for humans , the use of animals becomes justified .<-->N
Taylor -LRB- 132 -RRB- even supports this idea by indicating that very few animals are sacrificed during such experiments which help to not only save millions of people , but also animals .<-->O
Opponents of this claim have however cited cases of animal suffering and deaths because of ineffective experimental procedures .<-->O
Taylor -LRB- 120 -RRB- highlights a critical perspective regarding this issue by indicating that Of course , Jennie was not human ; she was a squirrel monkey .<-->N
To do such a research on a human being would be immoral .<-->O
The question then is , what justifies using a monkey ?<-->N
Other commentators have also indicated the idea of injecting animals with toxins in the name of scientific advancement .<-->N
Although these arguments may seem plausible , it is however important to note that humans are practically more important than animals .<-->O
It would thus be justified to assert that animal testing should not be banned .<-->O
It has also been found that technological advancement has enabled results from animal testing to be more accurate with minimal harm inflicted on animals .<-->N
Blakemore highlights the biological relationship that humans have with animals .<-->N
According to the author , chimpanzees and some rodents like mice and rats share similar genes with humans .<-->N
The way these animals respond to disease treatments is just the same as humans .<-->O
Because there is no other alternative to test the effectiveness of drugs and consumer goods , the use of animals in experiments becomes justified .<-->N
Blakemore reiterates that there are many incurable diseases such as Alzheimer s , schizophrenia , and multiple sclerosis which require quick research in order to find new treatment .<-->O
Because researchers and scientists have the ability to achieve this objective , they need to use every tool available at their disposal in order to ensure that cures for such diseases are found .<-->O
Critics of this argument have however maintained their stand regarding the futility of such efforts .<-->O
As critics claim , some drugs have not been as effective as claimed .<-->O
Indeed , some of the consumer products and drugs have had to be recalled because of ineffective experimental procedures which resulted in drugs not serving their intended purposes .<-->N
It can be justified to agree to this assertion considering that animal experiments are products of human making which are subject to errors and flaws .<-->N
However , with the recent advancement in technology , such cases have become rare .<-->N
Taylor -LRB- 134-136 -RRB- posits that there are new methods such as computer simulation which allows existing information and data to be used by researchers and scientists to further improve on what had earlier been done .<-->O
Banning animal testing would in this case amount to deteriorating health standards of people within societies .<-->N
Definitely , animal testing has been a con troversial issue considering that there are ethical implications associated with it .<-->N
While this may be true , the benefits of this procedure however outweigh the drawbacks .<-->O
For those who want a ban on animal testing to be lifted , the procedure is not ethical but only serves to infringe on the rights of animals .<-->O
The arguments made by critics however are shortsighted because history clearly indicates that the drugs that people are using nowadays came as a result of animal testing .<-->O
Fundamentally , animal testing should not be banned because there are possibilities of future cures being unearthed , the procedure is safe for humans , and the results have been more precise .<-->O

In order to measure `` the intensity of the salivary reflex , '' wrote Pavlov , the dogs were subjected to a `` minor operation , which consists in the transplantation of the opening of the salivary duct from its natural place on the mucous membrane of the mouth to the outside skin . ''<-->O
A `` small glass funnel '' was then attached to the salivary duct opening with a `` special cement . ''<-->N
-LSB- 86 , 75 -RSB- In 1959 , The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique by zoologist William Russell and microbiologist Rex Burch was published in England .<-->N
The book laid out the principle of the `` Three Rs '' for using animals in research humanely : Replacement -LRB- replacing the use of animals with alternative research methods -RRB- , Reduction -LRB- minimizing the use of animals whenever possible -RRB- , and Refinement -LRB- reducing suffering and improving animals ' living conditions -RRB- .<-->O
-LSB- 89 -RSB- The `` Three Rs '' were incorporated into the AWA and have formed the basis of many international animal welfare laws .<-->N
-LSB- 90 , 91 -RSB- Animals in Space and the Military Since as early as 1948 , animals have been used by the US space program for testing such aspects of space travel as the effects of prolonged weightlessness .<-->N
After several monkeys died in unmanned space flights carried out during the 1940s , the first monkey to survive a space flight was Yorick , recovered from an Aerobee missile flight on Sep. 20 , 1951 .<-->N
However , Yorick died several hours after landing , possibly due to heat stress .<-->N

Laika died of `` overheating and panic '' early in the mission , according to the BBC .<-->N
-LSB- 92 -RSB- The record for the most animals sent into space was set Apr. 17 , 1998 , when more than two thousand animals , including rats , mice , fish , crickets , and snails , were launched into space on the shuttle Columbia -LRB- along with the seven-member human crew -RRB- for neurological testing .<-->N
-LSB- 7 , 8 -RSB- Since the Vietnam war , animals have also been used by the US military .<-->N
The US Department of Defense used 488,237 animals for research and combat trauma training -LRB- `` live tissue training '' -RRB- in fiscal year 2007 -LRB- the latest year for which data are available -RRB- , which included subjecting anesthetized goats and pigs to gunshot wounds , burns , and amputations for the training of military medics .<-->O
-LSB- 6 , 93 -RSB- In February 2013 , after an escalation of opposition by animal rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatments of Animals -LRB- PETA -RRB- , Congress ordered the Pentagon to present a written plan to phase out live tissue training .<-->O
The US Coast Guard , however , which was at the center of a 2012 scandal involving videotaped footage of goats being mutilated as part of its live tissue training program , said in May 2013 that the program will continue .<-->O
-LSB- 94 , 95 -RSB- The Modern Debate The 1975 publication of Animal Liberation by Australian philosopher Peter Singer galvanized the animal rights and anti-testing movements by popularizing the notion of `` speciesism '' as being analogous to racism , sexism , and other forms of prejudice .<-->O
Addressing animal testing specifically , Singer predicted that `` one day ... our children 's children , reading about what was done in laboratories in the twentieth century , will feel the same sense of horror and incredulity ... that we now feel when we read about the atrocities of the Roman gladiatorial arenas or the eighteenth-century slave trade . ''<-->O
-LSB- 66 -RSB- In 1981 , an early victory by then-fledgling animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -LRB- PETA -RRB- served to revitalize the anti-testing movement once again .<-->O
A PETA activist working undercover at the Institute for Biological Research in Silver Spring , MD took photographs of monkeys in the facility that had engaged in self-mutilation due to stress .<-->O
The laboratory 's director , Edward Taub , was charged with more than a dozen animal cruelty offences , and an especially notorious photo of a monkey in a harness with all four limbs restrained became a symbolic image for the animal rights movement .<-->O

-LSB- 35 -RSB- A 2007 report by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences called for a reduction in the use of animal testing , recommending instead the increased use of in vitro methods using human cells .<-->N
Though the report touted new technologies that could eventually eliminate the need for animal testing altogether , the authors acknowledged that `` For the foreseeable future ... targeted tests in animals would need to be used to complement the in vitro tests , because current methods can not yet adequately mirror the metabolism of a whole animal .

-LSB- 104 -RSB- In Mar. 2013 , the European Union banned the import and sale of cosmetic products that use ingredients tested on animals .<-->N
Some proponents of animal testing objected , arguing that some animal tests had no non-animal equivalents .<-->N
A spokesman for the trade association Cosmetics Europe stated it is likely `` that consumers in Europe won t have access to new products because we can t ensure that some ingredients will be safe without access to suitable and adequate testing . ''<-->O
-LSB- 98 -RSB- India and Israel have also banned animal testing for cosmetic products , while the United States has no such ban in place .<-->N
-LSB- 99 -RSB- China is the only major market where testing all cosmetics on animals is required by law , and foreign companies distributing their products to China must also have them tested on animals .<-->N
-LSB- 65 , 43 -RSB- China has announced that its animal testing requirement will be waived for shampoo , perfume , and other so-called `` non-special use cosmetics '' manufactured by Chinesecompanies after June 2014 .<-->O
`` Special use cosmetics , '' including hair regrowth , hair removal , dye and permanent wave products , antiperspirant , and sunscreen , will continue to warrant mandatory animal testing .<-->N
-LSB- 114 -RSB- After ceasing to breed chimpanzees for research in May 2007 , the US National Institutes of Health announced in June 2013 that it will retire most of its chimpanzees -LRB- 310 in total -RRB- over the next several years .<-->O
While the decision was welcomed by animal rights groups , proponents said the decision would have a negative impact on the development of critical vaccines and treatments .<-->O
The Texas Biomedical Research Institute released a statement claiming that the number of chimps to be retained -LRB- up to 50 -RRB- was `` not sufficient to enable the rapid development of better preventions and cures for hepatitis B and C , which kill a million people every year . ''<-->O
-LSB- 100 -RSB- The United States and Gabon are the only two countries in the world that still experiment on chimpanzees .<-->N
-LSB- 4 -RSB- --------- Animal Testing Shouldn t Be Banned The exploitation of animals in experimentation isn t a new issue because it could be traced back to the fourth century BC when Aristotle and his contemporaries used to perform experiments on animals .<-->O
Besides , in the twelfth century , the Arab physician Avanzoar used animals to test his new surgery techniques before performing them on humans .<-->N
Today , due to the advancement of the medical field , physicians rely excessively on animal testing .<-->N
However , some organizations such as PETA -LRB- People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -RRB- stand out against animal testing alleging that it harms animals and calling for it to be outlawed .<-->O
I believe that animal testing shouldn t be banned for several reasons -LRB- Animal Experimentation -RRB- 1 The opponents claim that animals are susceptible to pain , and during the tests , animals are inflicted with severe injuries , and most of them die .<-->O
However , that isn t true because before physicians test drugs on animals , they test them on cells first , and they only use them on animals if they pass the cell test .<-->N
Moreover , they inject the animals with adequate anesthesia to mitigate their pains during the test .<-->N
In addition , the test is performed by experts who make sure to minimize the suffering of the animals by great extent .<-->O
-LRB- Animal Research Pros and Cons -RRB- 2 Animal testing plays a pivotal role in medical research and without it , combating critical diseases is futile .<-->O
Thanks to animal testing , vaccines have been developed for deadly disease such as Hepatitis B , Herpes Simplex , rabies , Polio , mumps , malaria , and rejection of 1 http://www.buzzle.com/articles/animal-experimentation.html -LRB- was retrieved on 10/12/2013 -RRB- 2 http://www.buzzle.com/articles/animal-research-pros-and-cons.html -LRB- was retrieved on 10/12/2013 -RRB- organ transplantation .<-->O
Furthermore , if the experimentation on animals were banned , techniques like bypass surgeries , organ transplants , and heart surgeries wouldn t be achieved , and many humans would perish .<-->O
The reason behind its importance is because some animals body system resembles humans to certain extent .<-->O
For example , the genes of chimpanzees and monkeys are similar to humans by 99 % , so testing on such species ensures physicians that the new medicines or drugs will be of benefits to mankind .<-->O
-LRB- Animal Testing Pros -RRB- 3 Moreover , it can not be afforded to outlaw animal experimentation for many reasons .<-->N
First , it will backfire on us because if physicians don t test medical products and medicines on animals , they will be compelled to test them on humans , and that could spell disaster and be a quite fatal .<-->O
Second , no one would volunteer for such experimentations , for nobody would like to be a testing subject in a laboratory .<-->O
In addition , doctors would have to use these medicines on patients which might deteriorate their health even further or cause immediate death .<-->O
Furthermore , that could prompt another problem which is equality crisis amid humans which might result in oppression of people from the lower class of the society .<-->O
-LRB- Animal Testing Pros -RRB- 4 To sum up , animal testing shouldn t be blacklisted for many reasons : there is no other alternative to test on .<-->N
It helps scientists to discern the effectiveness of drugs before using them on humans .<-->N
It helps developing vaccines for serious diseases and saving human lives .<-->N
I believe that if the opponents of animal experimentation have one member of their families sick with a life-threatening disease , they will forsake their belief and agree to sacrifice the lives of several animals in order to save their beloved person .<-->O
My belief is that human lives come first and have the priority .<-->N
If my mother s life were in danger , and animal testing is what it takes to save her , I wouldn t mind how many animals would be used to find her cure .<-->O
----------- Why Should Animal Testing be Banned Why Should Animal Testing be Banned The topic of whether animal testing should be banned is highly debatable and it draws out mixed reactions from people who support or oppose this activity .<-->O
However , a careful study of this subject reveals that claims supporting the merit of animal testing holds the least amount of credibility .<-->O
Actions of human beings , no matter how harmless they appear to be , have a great impact on the environment .<-->O
Even a seemingly passive act of littering rivers with waste materials leads to their clogging which over time turns into an irreparable damage .<-->O
The damage caused to environment due to animal testing and abuse is beyond our imagination .<-->O
Animal testing , as projected by the media doesn t seem harmless .<-->N
However , the underlying truth of this activity is often hushed up by personnel in animal testing laboratories .<-->N
In today s world , where technological aids can provide us with simulation results , the practice of animal testing can be avoided to some extent .<-->N
Due to sophistication in experiments , animal testing practices today , are less painful for the animals .<-->N
However , the fact remains that animals do suffer in such practices as they are made to undergo pain and face difficulty in adapting to the various changes their body undergos when experiments are conducted on them .<-->O
Reasons for Banning Animal Testing The activity of animal testing is of cruelty and sometimes unscientific .<-->N
Money spent on animal experimentation is wasted in many cases due to inability in obtaining accurate results , and all this at the cost of the animals well-being .<-->O
Here are a few arguments against animal testing that support the thought of banning this activity .<-->O
Cruel Practices Animals are a soft target for human beings it is however , not fair to take undue advantage of their helplessness .<-->O
It should be understood that a monkey or a mouse would experience the same amount of pain that human beings would do , on being made to undergo certain painful procedures .<-->O
Animals used for testing are often deprived of food , water and sleep .<-->N
For example , dogs are locked in gas chambers to test whether a particular insecticide is safe for inhalation by human beings .<-->N
Most often , anesthesia is not used at the time of testing .<-->N
A callous attitude towards the safety of animals is one of the main reasons for not using anesthesia when experimenting on animals .<-->O
Another reason for avoiding the use of anesthesia is the claim that test results get altered on doing so .<-->O
However , just imagine that you are being operated on without anesthesia or jammed in a cell just because someone else wants to know how your body reacts to that particular environment .<-->O
Only after being empathetic towards these creatures that you will realize what kind of pain these innocent animals have to bear during such experiments .<-->O
Fast Fact : Countries like New Zealand and Netherlands have banned the use of great apes and other primates for the purpose of testing .<-->O
Inaccurate Results The results obtained from animal testing are used to check whether a particular medicine or cosmetic product would have any side-effects on human beings .<-->N
The body systems of animals are different from those of human beings .<-->N
Aspirin is widely used for the treatment of fever , pain , inflammation , etc. in human beings .<-->O
However , this very medicine proves to be toxic for mice .<-->N
Most experiments are conducted on animals which can not be a reliable source for predicting results on human beings .<-->N
It means , the mice or rats are not the correct means to speculate reactions in human beings , while only monkeys and chimpanzees are they being closely related to humans .<-->O
Many of us don t know that drug companies are not held accountable for illnesses or side-effects resulting from their medicines or vaccines however , it is a fact that many newly tested medicines they proudly sell , actually fail to give positive results .<-->O
The side-effects of drugs like thalidomide and clioquinol are testimony to the claim that medicines tested on animals can not be considered safe for human use .<-->O
Therefore , it is not correct to fully rely on results of tests conducted on animals .<-->N
Fast Fact : According to the National Institute of Health most of the vaccines which passed the animal tests , actually failed in trials that were conducted on human beings .<-->N
Costly Affair Rearing animals for the purpose of testing requires a lot of investment on feeding and fulfilling other needs .<-->N
Animals used for testing must be fed certain amounts specific type of food , depending on what they are being tested for .<-->O
They require to be provided with shelter for the period for which they are experimented on .<-->N
Plus , there are huge expenses incurred in creating an artificial environment for the experiments and in conducting the tests on animals .<-->N
John McCain , a politician from USA has deemed the practice of animal testing as ethically , scientifically and financially unsound .<-->N
Animal testing statistics reveal that thousands of dollars are spent every year on animal testing and the activities cost the lives of millions of animals .<-->N
Fast Fact : According to Lexington Herald-Leader , a reputed media network , millions of tax-payer dollars are wasted on drug tests involving animals and they are pointless .<-->N
In today s world , many alternatives to animal testing have been developed , which is one logical reason why animal testing should be banned .<-->O
Tissue culture methods , for example can be used as alternatives to animal testing .<-->N
Crash test dummies devices which mimic humans have internal sensors and they can be used for experimentation instead of torturing living animals .<-->F
Monoclonal antibodies can be created with the help of cultured cells .<-->F
Tissue engineering techniques can be used for culturing these cells .<-->N
It is also possible to make a model of the human immune system in order to check whether a particular vaccine is effective or not .<-->O
Such models are referred to as Modular Immune In Vitro Constructs Fast Fact : Russell and Burch first developed a 3-Rs system that is based on the principles of finding alternatives to animal testing .<-->N
It stands for Replacement non-animal methods for experimentation Reduction lesser animals to obtain more information and Refinement procedures so as to reduce the pain and discomfort involved .<-->O
The practice of animal testing should be banned , considering that it is harmful from the ethical , environmental as well as the economical point of view .<-->O
Making use of alternatives that are available for animal experimentation is therefore , a better choice .<-->O
It is only by means of responsible and compassionate behavior towards animals that we can be called true human beings .<-->O
Progress in medicine is essential , but not at the cost of innocent lives .<-->N
As Mahatma Gandhi rightly said , You can judge a nation s moral progress by how it treats its animals .<-->O
Many countries today have laws that prohibit smoking in public places because it affects non smokers as well.This damages their health against their will and could cause them lung cancer.But also it seems as though this law protects only one side and public places -LRB- which should be available to everyone for all purposes -RRB- meet only the needs of non-smokers , tobacco causes addiction and active smokers can not spend a long time without lighting a cigarette which automatically makes public places and many other facilities unsuitable for them and their needs.Also this is bad for tourism in some parts , caterers are financially damaged by these new laws that suggest them to provide services to only one part of both residents and tourists.Is this law actually going to protect non-smokers or simply affect smokers ?<-->O
Is this a noble deed or a true act of discrimination ?<-->O
Smoking should definatly be banned in public places .<-->N
The places they do allow smoking might lose a bit of money , but it will also help with the health problems that occur .<-->O
Most people beleive that someone who is not in the smoking area of the public place will not be affected by the smoke , but smoke is able to spread in a room and affect the people around .<-->O
Smoking causes alot of problems not only for the smoker , but for the people around .<-->N
If someone were to put together a protest for those to stop smoking in public , I bet that every non - smoker would say they should .<-->O
I doubt that the bars are shutting down JUST BECAUSE smokers choose not to go .<-->N
Oh and by your logic , if someone is a pyromaniac and always has the need to light fires that its ok for them to run around in public with fire , the non pyromaniacs just need to avoid the fire .<-->O
No big deal right ?<-->O
smoking is up to the individual not others if people do n't like smoke aviod the people who are smoking .<-->N
I would not say that smoking should be banned , but I do not think it is necessary that people should go as far to have to avoid another person purely for them being a smoker .<-->O
What I think they should do is just go back to a smoking section with air vents leading upwards and away from people in the smoking section , making it less likely that if a door is opened to the smoking section , that smoke will go out .<-->O
Also , businesess are not losing a little bit of money , there are bars that have been there for years all around me that are being completely shut down .<-->O
All because people will not go there because they can not smoke .<-->N
Obviously , the cloud of smoke exactly disturbs other people ; especially non-smokers feeling .<-->O
Imagine sitting in a restuarant unable to enjoy the meal because of the smoke from neighbor 's table .<-->N
It should be banned because the percentage of non-smokers is higher than active smokers so non-smokers have right to clean air and also second hand smoke is more dangerous than actually smoking as well .<-->O
So are you saying pyromaniacs should be able to light fires as they please and theyre just being discriminated against because they dont occupy wall street ?<-->O
so are you saying that the non-smokers of America do n't have rights and that America is all about the majority winning ?<-->N
currently we are having the occupy wall street which is demoting the minority ruling .<-->N
Just because the non-smokers of America are more populous than the smokers , does n't mean that smoking should be banned just to please them .<-->O
Firstly , being in High School and being surrounded by smoke after school isnt even a little bit pleasent .<-->N
All of the older kids smoke so the youger kids like to be influenced by the Juniors and Seniors .<-->N
They will eventually start and gett into the habit of smoking .<-->N
Its also very unhealthy .<-->N
Secondly , being in a restaurant and having to smell that smoke while eating is not only disrepectful but also disturbing and once again not healthy .<-->N
I respect those who smoke away .<-->N
another reason is smoking will become a tendency , which lures a lot of young people to do so .<-->O
In fact , accordintg to some reliable surveys , numbers of smokers are rapidly increasing these day .<-->O
Of course , we can smoke if this will affect no one .<-->N
We together make some tigh and strict regulation for smokers if we dont want to have any adverse influences on our next generations .<-->O
it seems clear to me that most people have their opinions against smoking .<-->O
nevertheless , smoking still has some positive aspect to economic sides .<-->O
For example , many countries around the world , especially tropical nations , like Cuba as well as England consider cigarette as an important product to export to many other countries to get money or exchange other commodities .<-->O
therefore , they can use that money to invest in some different kinds of fields .<-->N
furthermore , in my country , selling cigarettes is also an easy job that everyone can do to earn more money , no matter how old they are .<-->O
As a result , this can bring some jobs for people and partially solve rate of unemployment .<-->N
second-hand smoke is harmful , just like smoking is .<-->O
i really feel that smoking in public places should be banned , because not only is it harming the health of smokers , but also the health of others around them .<-->O
in my opinion , smoking in public places , especially places with a lot of people is a pretty selfish thing to do .<-->O
i find that second hand smoke is very annoying , because everytime i walk past someone smoking , i always feel that i have to hold my breath .<-->O
smoking seriously harms people 's lungs , but so can second-hand smoke .<-->O
ah sorry , i misspelled the title .<-->N
i meant `` yes of course '' The problem with designated smoking areas is not alway the public , but also the employees .<-->N
What if said business does n't have smoking employees ?<-->N
Say in a restaurant they have a smoking area even with ventilation .<-->N
The larger the area , the larger the vent , the larger the vent the more powerful it needs to be , the more powerful it needs to be the louder it is .<-->O
This would disrupt the non smokers as its just an annoying noise created to feed the poor addicts their poison .<-->O
But what if we wanted to dull down the power or remove the vent all together ?<-->O
Keep the area away from the non smokers sounds ok but now you 're asking the waiter/waitress , busboy , manager , cleaning crew , bar tender , ect .<-->N
to go through these areas to serve , clean and address customers regardless of whether they smoke or not .<-->N
No a manager does not NEED to go through and would then be making it their own decision , but the other staff still needs to do their job .<-->O
Asking a restaurant to hire only employees that ` dont mind ' inhaling the second hand smoke is , in my opinion , far fetched and out of line .<-->N
It is bad enough that smokers get to go outside every 30 minutes to smoke for 5-10 minutes while non smokers have to work work work work all day without those breaks .<-->N
Now we 're going to suggest that smokers get jobs over them just because smoker need to inhale their cancer sticks ?<-->O
Yes , it is a real problem .<-->N
The smoke bothers every non-smoker .<-->N
But a complete ban is not necessary .<-->N
I mean , those public places can save up some money so they can build special areas for non-smokers and those areas would be vent .<-->O
This way would thank both parts : the part of population that smokes and love smoking while at a restaurant and the part of population that does n't smoke and ca n't stand the smoke .<-->O
So if somebody wants to smoke , let him do .<-->N
As long as it does n't socialy harm anyone .<-->O
And by using this special areas for smokers , everyone would be happy and the restaurants would make profit .<-->O
although people say that smoking is the smokers choice . .<-->N
its not . .<-->F
it is in some ways but not in all . .<-->N
it is their choice whether they want to pay to die , but our choice whether we want them to able to smoke around us , it is not just harming them when they smoke it is also harming us .<-->O
By smoking in public places all the people that go to those places have got to inhale their smoke although they have a made a choice to not smoke , they dont have a say in whether smoking will be a part in our life or not .<-->N
BUT if it was banned smokers could smoke in their home and cars , and harm themselves and not others .<-->N
Only 25 % of the stuff goes to the smoker and the rest is left for us .<-->N
People who have asthma need to carry their inhaler just in case of a smoker or cigarettes.The second amendment means you have the right to bear arms , and a cigarette is like a gun.Even though cigs are bad , they are classified as a harmful weapon that can cause serious injury or damage .<-->O
Also , right now we are both breathing in campfire , barbecues , and even marijuana smoke !<-->O
I do not see a ban on those items and I do not see a ban on cars ?<-->N
Do you ?<-->N
How about we just ban cars ???? Also tabacco is a legal drug and so is marijuana , so you can not just ban it !<-->O
Also , I looked up that the smoke from smokers produces 0.00092 % of carbon dioxide emissions in the world !<-->N
I have tons more but I 'm about to run out of battery , so my last point is that we are building our own natural disasters , like building power plants !<-->O
Only two out of the 50000 power plants in the world produce more carbon dioxide than the smoke from smokers does in a year !<-->N
People who smoke are more likely to develop diseases such as lung cancer and liver cirrhosis .<-->O
Cirrhosis is mostly caused by smoking and reduces and even poisons the liver , unable for the organ to perform its function .<-->O
For example , a healthy lung is pinkish in color and helps the person breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide .<-->N
But a smoker 's lung is very dark and is covered with tartar .<-->N
A smoker 's lung is unable to functionally help the person breathe and increases severe asthma , with causes stroke and heart attack Smoking is something that everyone does n't like , but they are n't doing any harm to anyone else by doing it .<-->O
Smoking only affects you , not the people around you .<-->N
I think that if people want to smoke they can .<-->O
Honestly if it was that big of a deal they would have made it illegal years ago .<-->O
It 's just something for everyone to argue about .<-->O
I think that smoking should be banned because I am a kid , and when I walk by a smoker I always have to cover my mouth which is quiet irritating sometimes .<-->O
Another reason is that it pollutes the air .<-->N
Last but not least , people who have asthma can be harmed or even killed if they want to take a walk in the park !<-->O
Look you 'll most likely be harmed by the stuff that 's already in the air than you will be by tobacco smoke .<-->O
If you do n't like being around smokers , do n't be around smokers , simple as that .<-->N
Sometimes , public places are the only places these people can smoke , so back off .<-->N
If a guy is smoking next to you , leave , or ask him to move , but do n't get all preachy about how bad it is .<-->N
Besides , people like you wo n't stop at cigarettes , you 'll move to alcohol , then high fructose corn syrup , fumes from cars , etc. etc. .<-->O
Just let us smoke our cigarettes , if you do n't like it , walk away .<-->N
My aunt smoked for years and now it is making it hard for me to breathe .<-->N
Smoking should be demolished period !<-->N
It is a useless hobby that people use because they have no life and are too lazy to get one .<-->O
No offense to those that do smoke but I just think it should be that way .<-->O
I got lung cancer because of my aunt 's stupid hobby !<-->N
All of you smokers should get a job , get a life , or get some friends .<-->N
It would be better for the rest of us that do n't smoke .<-->O
Smoking threatens the air that we non-smokers breathe , making us get sick .<-->N
Yes , smoking should be banned in public places ASAP .<-->N
People have no problem standing by endless amounts of idling and moving vehicles , so they should n't mind someone smoking nearby .<-->O
Exhaust and smog is just as bad , if not worse , than tobacco .<-->O
If one tries to argue logically that smoking in public should be banned , the logical extension is that vehicles should be , too .<-->O
Yes , it should be banned because people who smoke say that they have paid enough so why should they be forbidden to smoke , but it is not the non-smoker fault that they had spend so much money on cigarettes , it was their own choice .<-->O
Also , there are many diseases , such as cancer and cirrhosis that can be easily developed in a living body not just in a smoker one but in the liver that is needed by the one that is smoking .<-->O
Many people today suffer from asthma and they can not have just a little stroke but die .<-->O
Smoking also causes pollution and people who smoke leave their cigarettes everywhere they can -LRB- on the ground , in the grass , on the plants -RRB- .<-->N
But the biggest concern is that millions of forests have burned in the past decade just because smokers leave them lit up .<-->O
It is dangerous and I think it is more important to save something then to be sorry later for it , and that it is very selfish from the others who smoke to say that they should be allowed to enjoy the smell of the cigarettes , while others suffer Smoking is something that people may not like , but it is unavoidable .<-->O
The risk of getting cancer or something else from smoking , is about as high as crashing your car .<-->O
Yes you can die from smoking .<-->N
You can also die from alcohol poisoning , or food poisoning , or overdosing , or even by crashing your car !<-->N
But that does n't mean that people stop drinking , or eating , or doing drugs , or driving !<-->N
people should n't smoke in public places because kids have lung problems and the smoke does n't help the problem !!!! and for the people who say no is wrong !!!!! i personally have lung problems and when i 'm driving by no i do n't want the smell of the smoke in my face and no it does n't help my lung problems and when i am trying to enjoy my food i would not like to smell the smoke while i 'm eating .<-->O
i do n't like to smell smoke while i 'm going through the park ttrying to enjoy my day and i smell smoke !<-->N
for the people who smoke go right ahead one day you might get lung cancer and think back ... why ?<-->O
why did i smoke ?<-->N
was that a bad choice in my life ?<-->N
no it was n't and i regret that !<-->N
if you can get through that cancer you need to thank the lord for your life !!!<-->O
ask him for your forgiveness !!!<-->N
thank the lord for your life !!!<-->N
go to church get to know god more and thank him for everything he has done for you !!!!! As more cities consider bans on smoking in public places , Kentucky , as one of the heavier tobacco-using states , will undoubtedly continue to debate the pros and cons of this issue with considerable fervor .<-->O
As a health and physical educator , I feel the need to weigh in on this topic .<-->O
As you might expect , I support smoking bans with few reservations .<-->O
Here are five reasons why .<-->N
No. 1 : Secondhand smoke has serious negative health consequences .<-->N
I personally don t care what you do to your own body , although the educator in me would advise you to quit for your own good .<-->O
I do care that your behavior affects the health of others .<-->N
Unlike other self-indulgent behaviors like eating fast food or drinking alcohol in public , secondhand smoke is not singularly linked to the participant .<-->N
The negative effects of smoking in public carry over into other people s lives with a tangible , measurable , and sometimes permanent impact .<-->N
Whereas eating fast food for every meal or excessive alcohol consumption is likely harmful to the individual , the negative impact on others is minimal .<-->O
Some may argue that eating too much fast food may cause an earlier death and the associated increased cost of medical care is a burden on the taxpayer .<-->O
While probably true , the link is weaker , less immediate and less measurable than the one between secondhand smoke and health .<-->O
Secondhand smoke exposure is clearly linked with negative outcomes on a person s health .<-->N
While the exact degree of harm is debatable , a recent study published in the medical journal Circulation reviewed 13 studies from around the world and found that banning smoking in public places can reduce heart attack hospitalizations by up to 36 percent over time , regardless of geographical location .<-->O
Clearly , it s become increasingly more difficult to make a case that secondhand smoke causes no measurable injury to the breather especially over time .<-->O
The scientific evidence that links secondhand smoke with heart disease and cancer has been mounting for decades .<-->O
Not only that , the effects of temporary exposure to smoke are also well documented and include headaches , breathing problems , and even nausea .<-->O
The bottom line is that secondhand smoke has numerous short-term and long-term consequences for innocent bystanders .<-->N
No. 2 : Litter reduction .<-->F
Cigarette butts account for millions of pieces of litter annually and detracts from a location s aesthetic .<-->N
If smokers would dispose of their waste properly when they re in public places , this might not be an issue , but the fact of the matter is that they don t .<-->O
The evidence is there , littering attractive buildings and the surrounding landscape with cigarette butts .<-->N
A smoking ban would reduce litter .<-->N
Although not a primary argument in support of a public smoking ban , it is still a credible one .<-->O
No. 3 : The lingering odor of stale cigarettes .<-->N
In bars and restaurants and other establishments that permit smoking , many patrons find the smell of cigarettes to be unpleasant and annoying .<-->O
Cigarette smoke tends to linger on people s clothes and hair and takes longer to fade even after the offending party has left .<-->N
Clothes worn to a smoky bar may still smell like smoke days later .<-->O
No. 4 : The right to a healthy workplace .<-->O
It is the responsibility of the employer to provide a safe and healthy environment for its employees .<-->O
While many workers choose to work in workplaces that permit smoking , others may prefer not to be around smoke but persist because they need the employment .<-->O
A smoking ban opponent may simply say , work somewhere without smoke , yet I would argue that your insistence on smoking in public is not as important as that employee s health and livelihood .<-->O
Smokers unwillingness to control their urges should not force people to change jobs in the name of personal health and welfare .<-->O
No. 5 : The cost of secondhand smoke .<-->N
We re not talking only about the high cost of the smoking habit , which can average $ 1,500 a year just for the cigarettes .<-->O
But there also are smoking medical costs .<-->N
For example , a smoker with poor lung function may have much higher medical bills because of the smoking habit .<-->N
Smokers also pay more for life insurance and health insurance than nonsmokers , because of their higher risk of health care costs .<-->N
Smoking lowers the potential resale value of home and cars , because most buyers are not interested in purchasing a house or car that smells like cigarettes .<-->O
Not to mention the cost to businesses and taxpayers to beautify streets , buildings and other public places that have been littered and damaged by smoking .<-->N
These are some of the hidden costs of smoking .<-->N
Final thoughts .<-->N
I must add that despite my argument for banning smoking in public , I do support a person s right to smoke in private settings where the impact on other people is controlled and negligible .<-->O
My position is that with the use of controlled substances comes the responsibility to respect other people s health .<-->O
Medical studies have shown that smoking not only leads to health problems for the smoker , but also for people close by .<-->N
As a result of this , many believe that smoking should not be allowed in public places .<-->N
Although there are arguments on both sides , I strongly agree that a ban is the most appropriate course of action .<-->O
Opponents of such a ban argue against it for several reasons .<-->O
Firstly , they say that passive smokers make the choice to breathe in other people s smoke by going to places where it is allowed .<-->N
If they would prefer not to smoke passively , then they do not need to visit places where smoking is permitted .<-->O
In addition , they believe a ban would possibly drive many bars and pubs out of business as smokers would not go there anymore .<-->O
They also argue it is a matter of freedom of choice .<-->O
Smoking is not against the law , so individuals should have the freedom to smoke where they wish .<-->O
However , there are more convincing arguments in favour of a ban .<-->O
First and foremost , it has been proven that tobacco consists of carcinogenic compounds which cause serious harm to a person s health , not only the smoker .<-->O
Anyone around them can develop cancers of the lungs , mouth and throat , and other sites in the body .<-->N
It is simply not fair to impose this upon another person .<-->O
It is also the case that people s health is more important than businesses .<-->N
In any case , pubs and restaurants could adapt to a ban by , for example , allowing smoking areas .<-->N
In conclusion , it is clear that it should be made illegal to smoke in public places .<-->O
This would improve the health of thousands of people , and that is most definitely a positive development .<-->O
Everywhere you look , anti-smoking groups are campaigning against smokers .<-->N
They claim smoking kills one third or even half of all smokers ; that secondhand smoke is a major public health problem ; that smokers impose enormous costs on the rest of society ; and that for all these reasons , taxes on cigarettes should be raised .<-->O
There are many reasons to be skeptical about what professional anti-smoking advocates say .<-->N
They personally profit by exaggerating the health threats of smoking and winning passage of higher taxes and bans on smoking in public places .<-->N
The anti-smoking movement is hardly a grassroots phenomenon : It is largely funded by taxpayers and a few major foundations with left-liberal agendas .<-->O
A growing number of independent policy experts from a wide range of professions and differing political views are speaking out against the anti-smoking campaign .<-->O
These persons aren t defending the tobacco industry , they defend smokers for several reasons : Smokers already pay taxes that are too high to be fair , and far above any cost they impose on the rest of society .<-->O
The public health community 's campaign to demonize smokers and all forms of tobacco is based on junk science .<-->N
Litigation against the tobacco industry is an example of lawsuit abuse , and has loaded the gun for lawsuits against other industries .<-->O
Smoking bans hurt small businesses and violate private property rights .<-->O
The harm caused by smoking can be reduced by educating smokers about safer options such as electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco .<-->N
Appeals to protect the children don t justify the war being waged against adult smokers .<-->O
Punishing smokers for their own good is repulsive to the basic libertarian principles that ought to limit the use of government force .<-->O
The rest of this essay provides facts and analysis in support of each of these arguments .<-->O
It ends with advice on how to get more involved in the tobacco control debate .<-->N
Taxing Smokers Cigarettes are already the most heavily taxed commodity in the U.S. .<-->N
The federal excise tax is $ 1.01 a pack and the national average state excise tax is about $ 1.36 per pack , for a total of $ 2.37 per pack .<-->N
Some cities and states impose far higher taxes .<-->N
The combined state-local tax rate in Chicago is $ 6.16 per pack , and in New York City it is $ 5.85 per pack .<-->N
Such high and discriminatory taxes on smokers are unfair .<-->O
Kip Viscusi , the University Distinguished Professor at Vanderbilt University -LRB- and previously the Cogan Professor of Law and Economics and Director of the Program on Empirical Studies at Harvard Law School -RRB- has repeatedly demonstrated that smokers pay more in excise taxes than the social costs of their habits .<-->N
Even before the Master Settlement Agreement greatly increased the cost of cigarettes , excise taxes on cigarettes equal or exceed the medical care costs associated with smoking .<-->O
For example , Illinois cigarette taxes , according to Viscusi , were $ 0.13 more per pack than the social costs of smoking before the settlement added $ 0.40 to the price of a pack of cigarettes , before the $ 0.40 a pack tax hike approved by the state legislature in 2002 , and before Cook County s $ 0.82 a pack boost in 2004 .<-->N
Cigarette taxes also are an inefficient and unreliable way to raise funds for government .<-->N
Excise taxes require relatively high rates to raise funds , creating opportunities and incentives for evasion and the transfer of economic activity to states with lower taxes .<-->N
Dramatic price hikes and extreme taxes on cigarettes are threatening to create a stampede of tax evasion , black-market transactions , counterfeiting , and even use of lethal violence against convenience store clerks and truck drivers .<-->O
Recent tax hikes adopted by New York , Cook County , Illinois , and elsewhere threaten to take us to a neoprohibitionist era with all the crime , expenses , and loss of respect for law enforcement that accompanied Prohibition .<-->O
Excise taxes are also regressive .<-->N
People with low incomes not only pay a higher percentage of their incomes on cigarette taxes than do wealthier people , they even pay more in absolute terms .<-->O
Persons earning less than $ 10,000 paid an average of $ 81 a year in tobacco taxes , versus $ 49 for those who make $ 50,000 or more .<-->N
This was before recent massive tax hikes !<-->N
Finally , excise taxes require regular rate increases to keep pace with inflation , whereas income , sales , and property taxes all rise with inflation or economic growth .<-->N
Because of their narrow bases , excise taxes are unstable revenue generators .<-->N
Is second-hand smoke a rationale for higher taxes on tobacco or smoking bans ?<-->N
The research used to justify government regulation of second-hand smoke has been powerfully challenged by critics , including Congress s own research bureau .<-->O
According to the EPA , the risk ratio for forty years of exposure to a pack-a-day smoker is just 1.19 .<-->O
Epidemiologists as a rule are skeptical of any relative risks lower than 3 and dismiss as random ratios less than 1.3 .<-->N
An important report on second-smoke appeared in the May 12 , 2003 issue of the British Medical Journal .<-->N
Two epidemiologists , James Enstrom at UCLA and Geoffrey Kabat at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , analyzed data collected by the American Cancer Society from more than 100,000 Californians from 1959 through 1997 .<-->N
The results do not support a causal relation between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality , the researchers wrote , although they do not rule out a small effect .<-->O
The association between tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than generally believed .<-->O
It is generally considered that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is roughly equivalent to smoking one cigarette per day , according to Enstrom and Kabat .<-->N
If so , a small increase in lung cancer is possible , but the commonly reported 30 percent increase in heart disease risk -- the purported cause of almost all the deaths attributed to secondhand smoke -- is highly implausible .<-->O
Unjustified concern over the health effects of second-hand smoke have led to calls for bans on smoking in public spaces .<-->N
Are these bans justified ?<-->N
Most seats in most restaurants are already designated nonsmoking , and there is little evidence that nonsmokers who visit restaurants and bars believe smoking is a major concern .<-->O
In restaurants with smoking and nonsmoking sections , better ventilation systems rather than smoking bans can solve any remaining concerns .<-->O
Smoking bans have had severe negative effects on restaurants , bars , and nightclubs in cities where such bans have been enacted .<-->O
Smokers choose to stay home or visit with friends who allow smoking in their homes , or spend less time -LRB- and less money -RRB- in bars and nightclubs before leaving .<-->O
Smoking bans can also move noisy and potentially dangerous crowds onto sidewalks , and divert police resources from battling more serious crime .<-->O
Smoking bans violate the private property rights of individuals .<-->N
The owners of bars , restaurants , and other businesses should be free to decide whether to allow smoking in their establishments and what kinds of accommodations to make for nonsmokers .<-->O
Their customers should decide how important it is to be able to smoke or to experience a smoke-free environment .<-->O
The states legal crusade against the tobacco industry will one day rank as one of the worst developments in American public law in the twentieth century , wrote Michael DeBow , a professor of law at Cumberland School of Law , Samford University .<-->O
In 1998 , Philip Morris and other major tobacco companies settled a lawsuit brought by 46 states and five territories , promising them an astounding $ 243 billion over 25 years , and then approximately $ 18 billion a year in perpetuity .<-->O
The cost of this so-called Master Settlement Agreement -LRB- MSA -RRB- is entirely passed through to smokers ; it is not paid by tobacco companies .<-->O
The agreement dramatically increased the retail price of cigarettes .<-->N
The MSA was supposed to end litigation against tobacco companies , but lawsuits continue to be filed anyway , with irresponsible juries awarding millions and even billions of dollars to smokers who knew the risks but continued to smoke anyway .<-->O
Besides thousands of frivolous civil suits pursued by lawyers who long ago forgot the meaning of justice , the U.S. Justice Department is still pursuing a legal case against the tobacco industry initiated by the Clinton administration .<-->O
The MSA also loaded the gun for trial lawyers to go after other industries , generating approximately $ 13.75 billion in projected payments to lawyers .<-->N
It was , wrote DeBow , the largest transfer of wealth as a result of litigation in the history of the human race , a transfer that is being and will continue to be financed almost entirely by smokers paying higher prices for cigarettes .<-->O
Anti-smoking activists give smokers a stark choice : Stop smoking or die !<-->N
In fact , there is a third path : reduce the harm by shifting to less-hazardous products that provide similar enjoyment .<-->O
For example , switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or electronic cigarettes dramatically reduces the health risk .<-->N
For many years , Swedes have used a kind of spitless tobacco called snus .<-->N
At least partly because of the widespread use of snus , Sweden has the lowest rate of cigarette smoking and lung cancer in Europe .<-->O
Surely there are lessons here for U.S. tobacco policy .<-->N
Over the past several years , several millions cigarette smokers worldwide have quit smoking or dramatically reduced their cigarette consumption thanks to the use of smoke-free , tobacco-free , and often nicotine-free electronic cigarettes .<-->N
In April 2014 , the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health published a report summarizing a survey of more than 19,000 past and present users of electronic cigarettes the largest survey of its kind to date .<-->N
Electronic cigarettes helped 81 % of the survey respondents quit smoking .<-->N
Among those who had not quit entirely , one-third were non-daily smokers , and the rest had decreased consumption from 20 cigarettes to 4 per day .<-->N
Smokers primarily begin using electronic cigarettes for harm reduction and to reduce second-hand smoke exposure to family members .<-->N
Electronic cigarettes appear to be effective even in highly-dependent smokers .<-->O
Side effects are minor and reported health benefits are substantial .<-->O
Here is what this means for public policy : Electronic cigarettes are reducing smoking rates .<-->N
Adult smokers should not be discouraged from using electronic cigarettes .<-->N
Over-regulation of electronic cigarettes could make the products less appealing to potential quitters .<-->O
In light of their public health benefits , governmental policies should not treat electronic cigarettes the same as traditional tobacco products .<-->O
Unfortunately , some public health organizations and lobbying groups have made a business out of opposing smoking .<-->N
If electronic cigarettes solve many of the problems that come from smoking tobacco , their business may be hurt .<-->N
This conflict of interest means they will be among the last to admit that electronic cigarettes are a safe alternative for smokers .<-->O
0Kids shouldn t smoke cigarettes , but what is the best way to discourage underaged smoking ?<-->O
The tobacco industry is working hard to enforce minimum age standards by pushing retailers to require proof of age at the time of purchase .<-->N
Despite hysteria from the anti-smoking establishment on this matter , cigarette advertising does not target young people .<-->N
Saying we need high taxes on cigarettes to discourage teenagers from smoking is dishonest , since most teenage smokers don t buy their cigarettes , and get them instead from parents and adult friends .<-->O
It is unfair to impose dramatically higher taxes on the adults who buy 95 percent or more of all cigarettes sold in order to make cigarettes less attractive to the few teenagers who actually pay for their cigarettes .<-->O
Another reason to oppose the current campaign against smokers is because it violates the legitimate rights of smokers .<-->O
John Stuart Mill , in a slender book published in 1859 titled On Liberty , wrote : The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others .<-->O
His own good , either physical or moral , is not a sufficient warrant .<-->O
This is the basic premise of libertarianism , the political philosophy of the Founding Fathers .<-->N
Mill s statement is directly applicable to the controversy over smoking .<-->N
Quite simply , a just government does not have the authority to ban smoking on private property or to tell smokers to quit or to punish them if they do not .<-->O
Smokers are adults , not children , and they deserve to have their informed choices respected by others .<-->N
If we pass laws forcing smokers to change their behavior for their own good , we need to ask : Where do we stop ?<-->O
Do we pass laws against smoking in private homes ?<-->N
Against frying food indoors -LRB- which also releases known carcinogens into the air -RRB- ?<-->N
Eating the wrong kinds of food ?<-->N
Eating too much ?<-->N
Weighing too much ?<-->N
Drinking too much -LRB- and not just when driving -RRB- ?<-->O
Exercising too little ?<-->N
Should we ban other risky behavior , such as skydiving , bungee-jumping , or riding motorcycles ?<-->N
How about drinking more than one cup of coffee each day ?<-->N
In July 2006 , The Heartland Institute published Please Don t Poop in My Salad -- a collection of essays and presentations written by Heartland President Joseph Bast during the past several years concerning taxes and regulations imposed on tobacco and its consumers .<-->N
Defending smokers is a thankless task in today s politically correct environment , and Bast doesn t deny that smoking is an unhealthy habit .<-->O
But today s taxes and bans go far beyond a reasonable public policy response to a public health problem .<-->N
Bast asks for a reasoned debate that respects the rights of smokers and the owners of bars and restaurants .<-->O
The book is available for purchase in Heartland 's online store at http://store.heartland.org .<-->N
The entire book is also available online for downloading -- free of charge -- in Adobe Acrobat 's PDF format , and individual chapters are available for viewing in HTML .<-->N

Two credible and interesting people who write frequently on tobacco issues are Jacob Sullum and Kip Viscusi .<-->O
You can find articles by them in PolicyBot simply by searching for their names in the Author search box .<-->N
Have you ever come home with the stench of smoke clinging to your clothes ?<-->N
Or inhaled a cloud of smoke as a group of smokers passed , causing you to cough and choke ?<-->N
Neither experience is pleasant , and this is why smoking should be banned in public areas .<-->N
Smoking can be dangerous not only for the smoker , but also for those around the smoker .<-->N
Secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death -LRB- after active smoking and alcohol -RRB- , according to the Manitoba Medical Association .<-->O
They also say that the smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals , 50 of which are known to be cancer-related .<-->N
Secondhand smoke has been linked to heart and respiratory disease ; lung , breast , cervical , and nasal sinus cancers ; strokes and miscarriages .<-->N
In children , dangers include sudden infant death syndrome , fetal growth impairment , bronchitis , pneumonia , asthma and middle-ear disease .<-->O
People who smoke subject themselves to deadly diseases , as well as long - and short-term health problems .<-->O
Non-smokers should not have to live with the consequences of smokers ' actions .<-->N
Not permitting smoking in public areas may help people refrain from smoking .<-->N
Some argue that there would be a significant decline in the clientele in bars and clubs , but non-smokers actually outnumber smokers three to one .<-->O
A ban could actually increase people going out because nonsmokers would be more comfortable .<-->O
There may also be a sudden realization of the dangers of smoking .<-->N
With the state government taking a stand , it may cause people to take another look at the deadly factors of `` cancer sticks . ''<-->O
After a recent incident from the widely known Target Market program , people are beginning to feel that anti-tobacco efforts are losing their focus .<-->O
At a local event a couple years ago , a punk band hired by the anti-drug campaign played songs that included positive images of cigarettes and other drugs in their lyrics .<-->N
This is not the most efficient way to use money set aside for anti-drug programs .<-->N
Instead , this money could be used to enforce the laws that should be passed to ban smoking in public places .<-->N
Sometimes those you think would be against the idea of making smoking illegal actually agree with it .<-->O
Patrick Reynolds , heir to the tobacco empire , rejected becoming president of his family 's tobacco company because it was proven to have caused both his father 's and his older brother 's deaths .<-->N
Now , he runs a campaign to stop people from smoking .<-->N
In his presentation , he states that a smoker will spend about $ 1,400 a year for one pack a day .<-->N
Reynolds also says that the more secondhand smoke you inhale , the more susceptible you are to health problems .<-->N
People working in casinos , for example , are up to eight times as likely to be in danger of the effects of secondhand smoke .<-->N
Banning smoking in public places can prevent death and illness .<-->N
Some say that no matter what , nothing will reduce or stop cigarette smoking altogether .<-->O
The laws banning smoking might convince some to quit and create a safer environment for everyone else .<-->O
Also , some argue that there is n't money to carry this out .<-->N
The money that goes into programs such as Target Market and Big Tobacco will be cut and the difference will go toward law enforcement .<-->O
Smoking is a dangerous habit that not only affects the smoker , but those around him or her .<-->N
Banning the smoking in public will keep non-smokers safer .<-->N
People who smoke subject themselves to deadly diseases by choice .<-->N
Why should non-smokers be forced to be around it ?<-->N
The smoking ban disregards property rights .<-->N
The air in a pub belongs neither to smokers nor non-smokers , and certainly not to politicians , but to the publican .<-->O
It is the publican who should decide the smoking policy on his or her own premises .<-->N
The smoking ban sets a terrible precedent by blurring the boundary between public and private .<-->N
A public place should be defined as somewhere that -LRB- a -RRB- you have no choice but to enter , and/or -LRB- b -RRB- is financed by your taxes .<-->N
Civic offices , libraries and law courts are public places ; pubs , clubs and restaurants are not .<-->N
Politicians and doctors should have no right to dictate what people do in such private spaces .<-->O
If we concede to them that right , they will inevitably extend it to other behaviours and other places , for example to our cars -LRB- as they are now trying to do -RRB- and then to our homes -LRB- which has already happened in parts of the US and , in specific situations , in the UK , too -RRB- .<-->O
The smoking ban removes freedom of choice .<-->N
Not only are smokers denied the freedom to choose a place where we can enjoy a legal habit , but everyone is denied the freedom to work out their own compromises and solutions so that both smokers and non-smokers get what they want.The smoking ban is undemocratic .<-->O
Prior to the passing of this legislation , the UK Office for National Statistics found 68 per cent of people were opposed to a total ban .<-->N
Moreover , Labour promised in its General Election manifesto in 2005 to ban smoking only in places serving food .<-->N
But a total ban was imposed regardless .<-->N
The only opinions lawmakers have listened to are those of medical authorities , lobby groups and - directly or indirectly - the pharmaceutical companies that frequently fund those organisations .<-->N
The smoking ban is socially divisive and encourages intolerance .<-->O
Government is blatantly stigmatising a particular group , who must change its behaviour or be excluded from correct society -LRB- a recent National Health Service campaign used the slogan If you smoke , you stink -RRB- .<-->O
Well-intentioned or not , anti-smoking authorities have created tremendous animosity between friends , neighbours and family members .<-->O
The authorities have also encouraged people to think that government can , or should , intervene to stop one group of people doing whatever another group doesn t approve of .<-->O
The smoking ban is hypocritical .<-->N
Tobacco remains legal and the Treasury makes around 10 billion per year from taxing it .<-->N
And , incidentally , there is a smoker-friendly bar in the House of Commons .<-->N
The smoking ban is bad for business .<-->N
Despite ever more contrived efforts to prove otherwise , pubs and clubs are dying , in part , because of the business lost as smokers find somewhere else to drink where they can smoke in peace .<-->O
The ban may not be the only factor in the decline of pubs and clubs , but only the most blinkered smoke-hater would deny that it is a significant one .<-->O
The smoking ban is technologically backward .<-->N
It is not difficult , with decent modern air filtration technology , to make smoke virtually unnoticeable , and certainly harmless .<-->O
The smoking ban does not stop people smoking .<-->N
Even if it were appropriate to ban smoking in pubs in order to pressure people into quitting which , as an attack on personal choice , it is not the ban doesn t have the desired effect .<-->O
In many places -LRB- including the countries with the longest-standing bans in Europe , Ireland and Italy -RRB- smoking rates have risen since bans have been imposed .<-->N
Anti-smoking zealots refuse to recognise that they have already reduced smokers to a hard core who will not quit , and their increasingly bullying tactics are actually backfiring .<-->O
Even if tobacco were made completely illegal , millions would continue to use it .<-->O
The smoking ban turns hospitality industry employees into law enforcers .<-->N
Enforcing the law is the job of the police , not bar staff , waiters , publicans or restaurant managers .<-->N
This sets another bad precedent , especially when members of the public are also encouraged to report violations of the ban .<-->O
These are the methods of the Gestapo or the Stasi , who maintained control by making ordinary citizens fear each other .<-->N
The smoking ban does not get rid of smokers , but merely displaces us .<-->O
Smokers have been forced to go to the only places we can smoke : the streets and the home .<-->N
In the first case , it s pretty hard for us not to become more visible , and to create some degree of obstruction , noise or mess ; and in the second , we are , according to anti-smokers , poisoning our family members or at least , setting a bad example .<-->O
The result of all this is that , perversely , the smoking ban gives non-smokers less choice over where and when they confront smoking .<-->O
The smoking ban is built on an illusory health threat .<-->N
This is perhaps the most important reason of all , because the question of health is used by the government to override all other considerations .<-->O
In this case , the deadly health threat is secondhand smoke .<-->N
But there is no actual proof that even one person has died from this phantom menace .<-->O
After 40 years of studies , anti-smokers can still only produce computer projections based on dubious statistics , and relative risk ratios which sound scary but mean nothing in the real world .<-->O
That s why we see , for instance , posters telling us that tobacco smoke contains various nasty-sounding chemicals , without mentioning that these substances are present only at infinitesimal , harmless levels .<-->N
If we accept that such feeble evidence justifies a smoking ban , we are setting the level of acceptable risk so low as to justify banning just about everything else , too : cooking -LRB- which produces carcinogens -RRB- , candles , incense , open fires , perfume , etc. .<-->O
Thousands of products , from household cleaners to cosmetics , contain higher levels of toxic chemicals than tobacco and all those everyday products are harmless , too .<-->O
It is also absurd to forbid adults from choosing to accept the risk of working in a smoking venue when they are free , for instance , to work down mines , on oil rigs , fighting fires , and so on .<-->O
Ultimately , the problem here goes way beyond to smoke or not to smoke .<-->N
There is a worrying general trend towards more and more intrusive legislation , justified by more and more dishonest and misleading junk science and fearmongering .<-->O
Typical of this are recent claims that the continuation of a long-term decline in heart attacks is caused by smoking bans , and the invention of a new threat , thirdhand smoke , on the basis of no scientific evidence whatsoever .<-->O
What is needed is not just the repeal of the smoking ban and other illiberal laws , but a return to healthy scepticism about the claims made about various risks , fairness and tolerance towards others with different habits , and a large dose of common sense .<-->O
Since the early 1990s , most states and cities have banned smoking in public indoor spaces such as bars , restaurants , and offices .<-->N
These bans were sparked by contemporary research that , for the first time , proved the harmful , carcinogenic effects of secondhand smoke .<-->N
Over the past few years , cities around the country have been proposing -LRB- and sometimes passing -RRB- bans on smoking in public outdoor spaces such as parks , bus stops , and even sidewalks .<-->N
These outdoor proposals have fueled a lively debate between public health advocates and opponents who see such bans as an infringement on individual rights .<-->O
It s a complicated dilemma that reveals the murky complexities of social engineering , civil liberties , and addiction treatment .<-->O
Since tobacco use is largely perceived to be a bad habit that squanders money and lives , should smoking be banned in public places ?<-->O
If so , how far are we as a society willing to go in order to police our behavior ?<-->N
It s easy to forget that the smoke-free indoor spaces are still a relatively recent phenomenon .<-->O
In many states and countries around the world , restaurants , bars , and offices still allow smoking , but the trend is decidedly leaning towards a smoke-free future .<-->N
The dangers of smoking indoors are generally acknowledged throughout the world .<-->N
Extensive research has proven that people who work in spaces with cigarette smoke have an elevated risk of getting lung cancer , emphysema , and other smoking-related ailments , even if they ve never smoked a cigarette in their life .<-->O
A consensus generally emerged from the public that banning smoking indoors was a necessary act for maintaining public health , and governments at the local and state levels have acted to outlaw indoor smoking .<-->O
Some anti-smoking advocates have now shifted their energies towards enacting even more wide-ranging smoking bans .<-->N
New York City has been at the head of the pack by prohibiting smoking in most city-owned outdoor spaces , such as parks , waterfronts , and monuments .<-->N
But how far are we willing to go to avoid the potential risks of second-hand smoke ?<-->O
There are four main arguments for banning smoking in public places .<-->N
The first is the issue of secondhand smoke .<-->N
Ban advocates argue that sidestream smoke from cigarettes can harm individuals standing downwind , much in the same way that it does indoors .<-->O
The second is that cigarette butts are a form of litter .<-->N
Since most smokers prefer to drop their butts on the ground , ban advocates argue that the best way to keep the streets clean is to ban smoking altogether .<-->O
There have also been efforts to ban smoking in parks , due to the fact that cigarettes pose a major wildfire risk if not disposed of properly .<-->O
The third argument for outdoor bans is that non-smokers should not have to be subjected to the image of someone smoking in public .<-->O
Many parents would prefer that their children not be exposed to the sight and smell of people smoking cigarettes .<-->O
They feel that smoking instead should , like alcohol , be permitted only in non-public spaces .<-->O
Finally , outdoor smoking ban advocates argue that they are doing society and ultimately the smokers themselves a favor by banning the act .<-->O
The theory is that if smokers are sufficiently discouraged from lighting up in public , they will be more likely to quit and , therefore , avoid developing a smoking-related illness .<-->O
Society also benefits because our health care system will spend less money on treating preventable illnesses caused by smoking Arguments Against A Public Smoking Ban But not everyone is enamored with the idea of prohibiting smoking in all public areas .<-->O
Many people , including a sizeable number of non-smokers , are opposed to the idea of banning outdoor smoking on philosophical grounds .<-->N
They view such bans to be actions of an ever-creeping nanny state which seeks to regulate and punish all sorts of private behaviors , even at the expense of our civil liberties Cigarettes are , after all , perfectly legal to buy and smoke in the United States .<-->O
Ban opponents therefore argue that the government doesn t have the authority to regulate what people do to their own bodies in a public , open-air environment .<-->O
Some also believe that banning smoking in public could push our society down a slippery slope of behavioral control laws .<-->O
This view is mostly a reaction to the pro-ban argument that children and young people shouldn t be exposed to the sight of someone engaging in an unhealthy activity , lest they try to mimic it .<-->O
But where exactly does that line of thinking end ?<-->O
If we ban smoking outside because it s unhealthy , shouldn t we also ban the consumption of fast food and ice cream in public in order to combat obesity ?<-->N
Political philosophies aside , the most persuasive argument against outdoor smoking bans is that there s very little scientific evidence to back them up .<-->O
In fact , a lot of the research indicates that banning smoking in public areas wouldn t do much to improve public health .<-->O
A recent study found that there was virtually no elevated health risk for people exposed to secondhand smoke in outdoor areas .<-->O
This lack of scientific proof is cited by opponents who argue that outdoor smoking bans are more about stigmatizing and banishing smokers in a punitive manner than protecting public health .<-->O
While there is ample evidence that being in a smoky indoor space exposes you to carcinogens , the same can not be said about outdoor secondhand smoke .<-->N
Furthermore , non-smokers choose to put up with many other types of pollutants when they go outside .<-->N
In many cities , carbon monoxide from car emissions is the far more prevalent and similarly toxic air pollutant , yet nobody has proposed a blanket ban on cars .<-->O
Why Prohibition Isn t Enough The truth is that bans on smoking in public places are , as their often critics claim , social engineering measures designed to disincentivize the act of smoking .<-->O
Because our society has reached a consensus that smoking should be discouraged , many people feel that it is the government s responsibility to denormalize the act of smoking around other people by outlawing the behavior outright .<-->O
The theory is that if smoking becomes socially stigmatized to the point of invisibility , more people will make the decision to quit , and fewer young people will choose to take up the habit .<-->O
The main flaw with this Pavlovian approach to quitting is that smoking is not merely a personal choice rather , it is motivated by an addiction to nicotine , which has proven to be one of the most difficult drugs in the world to quit .<-->O
While the goals of smoking ban advocates are well-intentioned , simply outlawing behavior has never been the most effective strategy for getting people to quit their stubborn addictions .<-->O
A typical smoker who is no longer allowed to smoke in a park on his lunch break will , on average , find the nearest alleyway to smoke in .<-->N
Most smokers will endure extra hassles if it means they can get their nicotine fix , and that is precisely why social ostracization alone can not help most of them quit for good .<-->O
If anything , they force smokers to cling to their addiction even more tightly , safely out of public view .<-->O
At their worst , outdoor bans increase the alienation smokers feel without helping them gain any control over their addictions .<-->O
It fails to solve the deeper issue , much like how bans on panhandling don t eliminate the problem of homelessness ; they merely displace it .<-->O
The most productive and compassionate approach to the public health issue of smoking is to treat smokers as addicts rather than willful nuisances .<-->O
When treating addictions , the addict s attitude and mental state are crucial .<-->N
Cessation techniques that focus on psychologically overcoming nicotine addiction , such as hypnotherapy , have produced better long-term outcomes than laws designed to banish smokers from public view .<-->O
I want to urge all adult men and women to call or write letters to your state senator and state house representative to urge them to support legislation being sponsored by State Sen. Vivian Davis Figures that would ban smoking in all public places and places of employment here in Alabama .<-->O
Smoking bans would reduce the risk of heart attacks among nonsmokers big time .<-->O
About 3,000 nonsmoking men and women die each year as a result of breathing cigarette smoke from a man or woman who smokes cigarettes .<-->N
A third of all heart attacks suffered by men and women here in the United States each year is related to cigarette smoking .<-->F
Children of parents who smoke cigarettes have more lung illnesses than children of non-cigarette-smoking parents have .<-->N
Parents who smoke cigarettes are more likely to cough which spreads germs and exposes children to chest illnesses .<-->F
Women who smoke cigarettes can also cause their children to develop asthma .<-->N
Men and women who choose to smoke cigarettes should have a right to do so but they should only be allowed to smoke their cigarettes at the following places : their place of residence ; cars , trucks , vans or SUVs ; the outdoors and at publicly owned outside venues .<-->O
REASONS FOR BANNING SMOKING IN CERTAIN PUBLIC OUTDOOR AREAS * 1 .<-->N
Careful scientific studies based upon both highly accurate mathematical modeling techniques as well as actual real-life measurements have shown that concentrations of secondhand tobacco smoke in many outdoor areas are often as high or higher than in some indoor areas and that the risks posed by such outdoor exposure , while small to most individuals , are well beyond generally accepted norms when large numbers of people are involuntarily exposed .<-->O
Indeed , for these very reasons , the State of California in a report summarizing much of this evidence was preparing and has now declared OUTDOOR tobacco smoke as a toxic air pollutant .<-->O
Drifting tobacco smoke , even outdoors , can trigger asthmatic attacks , bronchial infections , and other serious health problems in nonsmokers .<-->O
This is especially true for the almost 100 million Americans who have asthma , chronic bronchitis , chronic sinusitis , emphysema , and other breathingrelated conditions which make them especially susceptible to secondhand tobacco smoke .3 .<-->O
Even for people without such respiratory conditions , breathing drifting tobacco smoke for even brief periods can be deadly .<-->O
For example , the Centers for Disease Controls -LSB- CDC -RSB- has warned that breathing drifting tobacco smoke for as little as 30 minutes -LRB- less than the time one might be exposed outdoors on a beach , sitting on a park bench , listening to a concert in a park , etc. -RRB- can raise a nonsmoker s risk of suffering a fatal heart attack to that of a smoker .<-->O
The danger is even greater for those who are already at an elevated risk for coronary problems : e.g. , men over 40 and postmenopausal women , anyone who is obese , has diabetes , a personal or family history of heart or circulatory conditions , gets insufficient exercise , has high blood pressure , cholesterol , etc. -LSB- 8 -RSB- 4 .<-->O
In cases where drifting tobacco smoke was present and a nonsmoker suffered a heart attack , asthmatic attack , or other similar problems , the municipality which owns and operates the beach , park , playground , etc. could be liable since it was on notice of the known health dangers but failed -LSB- 9 -RSB- to take the reasonable step of banning smoking as taken by many other outdoor areas .<-->O
-LSB- 10 -RSB- 5 .<-->N
Society recognizes that people have a right not to be involuntarily exposed to known carcinogenic substances , even if only to small amounts and for brief periods .<-->O
That s why , for example , extensive and very expensive precautions are taken when asbestos is removed from buildings .<-->O
This insures that people outside are not exposed even to minute amounts as they pass by .<-->N
Similarly , we would not tolerate someone who filed down old brake drums in a playground , thereby releasing even tiny amounts of asbestos into the air .<-->O
Secondhand tobacco smoke is officially classified by the federal government as a known human carcinogen exactly the same category as asbestos .<-->N
-LSB- 11 -RSB- 6 .<-->N
Even aside from health hazards , being forced to breathe tobacco smoke is annoying and irritating to most people , especially the almost 100 million Americans who have chronic conditions like -LSB- 12 -RSB- asthma and bronchitis which make them especially susceptible to tobacco smoke , and young -LSB- 13 -RSB- children who are also especially sensitive .<-->O
It should be noted that many activities are banned in -LSB- 14 -RSB- public places simply because they are annoying or irritating , even if they do not pose a health hazard .<-->O
Common example are playing loud music on portable radios or boom boxes , engaging in -LSB- 15 -RSB- sexually provocative activity , using profanity , dressing in inappropriately scanty attire , drinking alcoholic beverages , etc. 7 .<-->O
Many of the 96 million Americans who have chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis which make them especially susceptible to tobacco smoke have been held to be entitled to protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act -LSB- ADA -RSB- .<-->O
Thus , if their medical conditions mean that they -LSB- 16 -RSB- can not enjoy lying on a blanket at the beach or in a park for a concert where smoking is generally permitted , they may be entitled by law to a reasonable accommodation , presumably one which protects them from drifting tobacco smoke .<-->O
* Prepared as a public service by Action on Smoking and Health -LRB- ASH -RRB- , 2013 H St. , NW , Washington , DC 20006 , -LRB-202-RRB- 659-4310 .<-->N
ASH is a national tax-exempt legal-action organization concerned with the problems of smoking and protecting the rights of nonsmokers .<-->O
For more information , please see ; http://ash.org .<-->N
Comments and suggestions are appreciated .<-->N
The reason for banning smoke around building entrances is simple .<-->N
People should not be forced to be exposed to known carcinogenic substances for even the briefest periods of time , and because even brief exposure can also be annoying and irritating to many people , nonsmokers should not be forced to run a gauntlet of smokers gathered around the exits and entrances to their workplaces , -LSB- 17 -RSB- or other buildings which they are likely to frequent .<-->O
Large buildings ordinarily have air intakes to replace the air which is exhausted by their ventilation systems .<-->O
Occasionally , the air intake will be located near a doorway to the building , or in some other area where smokers might tend to congregate .<-->O
Therefore , to prevent this smoke-filled air from entering and being circulated throughout the building where it can create a health risk as well as annoyance and physical irritation , it may be necessary to prohibit smoking outdoors around such air intakes .<-->O
-LSB- 18 -RSB- 10 .<-->N
Cigarette butts discarded by smokers constitute the overwhelming majority of litter on beaches , as well as in many other public places like parks , playgrounds , and sidewalks .<-->O
-LSB- 19 -RSB- -LSB- 20 -RSB- Smoking bans have been shown to substantially reduce the litter and therefore the costs of cleaning up beaches and other outdoor areas , as well as to improve the overall appearance and -LSB- 21 -RSB- attractiveness of the area .<-->O
-LSB- 22 -RSB- 11 .<-->N
Cigarettes are a major source of burns to youngsters , including to their faces , when smokers hold their cigarettes at their sides and young children inadvertently come too close .<-->O
This can happen easily when children are at play or otherwise distracted on a beach , waiting on a line while their -LSB- 23 -RSB- parents wait to buy tickets , to use an ATM machines , etc. and once again there may be legal liability ; -LSB- 24 -RSB- 12 .<-->N
Discarded cigarettes which are designed to continue to burn for several minutes when dropped and not puffed upon are also a major fire hazard , threatening piers , boardwalks , and wooden structures in parks and playgrounds , etc. , as well as outdoor park and recreation areas .<-->O
-LSB- 25 -RSB- -LSB- 26 -RSB- 13 Young children playing in the sand at a beach or in playground sandbox may be tempted to put cigarette butts which contain concentrated amounts of carcinogens and other toxic chemicals trapped from tobacco smoke into their mouths , and even older children may touch the cigarette -LSB- 27 -RSB- butts and then put their fingers in or near their mouths , eyes , etc. 14 Discarded cigarette butts may also be harmful to birds and other wildlife which nibble on or even swallow them , especially on a beach or park , but also even on a public sidewalk .<-->O
Indeed , one of -LSB- 28 -RSB- the first domestic bans on outdoor smoking was enacted to protect wildlife rather than human beings .<-->O
-LSB- 29 -RSB- 15 .<-->N
Activities and images which might be inappropriate for young children and/or which might lead them into bad habits are often prohibited in public places , even if they pose no health risk and might even be appropriate in areas visited voluntarily only by adults .<-->O
For example , virtually all -LSB- 30 -RSB- municipalities have long prohibited consumption of alcoholic beverages in public places like parks and beaches .<-->O
The purpose is obviously not to prevent drunkenness or driving while intoxicated since people can easily get drunk drinking in their parked cars , in bars , and at home .<-->O
Rather , bans are imposed because drinking sets a bad example for young children to see it done openly even if the same children might see it in their own homes .<-->O
Similarly , prohibiting smoking in outdoor places frequented by the public like parks , playgrounds , beaches , etc. shields young children from seeing smoking as a common adult behavior to be emulated , even if some may observe smoking by the parents and other adults in private homes .<-->N
Other examples where activities are prohibited in public places because of their possible impact on children include sexually suggestive movements -LRB- permitted on dance floors but prohibited in parks and on sidewalks -RRB- , gambling -LRB- permitted in casinos and tracks but not in public places -RRB- , displays of pictorial nudity -LRB- permitted in art galleries but not on sidewalks -RRB- , etc. 16 .<-->N
In addition to all of the above reasons , it has now become clear that restrictions on smoking are a major factor in helping to persuade smokers to quit , and to help those who want to stop smoking to do so .<-->O
The result can be an enormous saving of lives , in the prevention of disability , and in a -LSB- 31 -RSB- dramatic reduction in health care costs most of which are borne by nonsmokers who otherwise are forced to pay higher taxes and inflated health insurance premiums .<-->O
Smoking bans including outdoors as well as indoors encourage and support quitting by making it more inconvenient for a person to remain a smoker .<-->O
Every ban on smoking also sends a very clear educational message to the smoker that his conduct is not desirable and indeed is found to be annoying and irritating if not repugnant by a large majority of others .<-->O
Finally , smoking bans help those already trying to quit by tending to assure that they will not be tempted by being in the presence of a smoker , smell the tempting aroma of tobacco smoke , etc. .<-->O
While not the primary argument or purpose in enacting outdoor smoking bans , this additional significant effect of such bans may well be a factor in deciding to support such public health measures .<-->O
SUMMARY More than 350 jurisdictions have successfully prohibited smoking in outdoor areas such as beaches , parks , playgrounds , near building entrances , while waiting in lines , etc. without legal challenges , problems of enforcement , loss of patronage or taxes , etc. .<-->O
Such bans appear to be so successful that more jurisdictions are sure to be added .<-->O
Indeed , as smoking is being banned in an ever growing number of indoor areas , people are beginning to expect freedom from these toxic fumes , and to expect air unpolluted by tobacco smoke wherever they may congregate .<-->O
-LSB- 32 -RSB- Very strong recent evidence of this trend is the overwhelming vote by the citizens of the State of Washington to ban smoking not only in all bars and restaurant , but to also require that building entrances be smokefree , and to prohibit smoking within 25 feet of doorways , windows , and ventilation ducts of smokefree establishments .<-->O
This vote comes on the heels of a poll by the New York State Health Department which showed that the public support for banning smoking in many outdoor areas is even stronger than similar support for a 2003 bill banning indoor smoking .<-->O

Under common principles of negligence law , a public or private entity can be held liable for injuries caused on its property , provided that it knew -LRB- and/or was on notice -RRB- of the danger .<-->O
This is true even if the most immediate cause was another person -LRB- here , the smoker -RRB- so long as the entity could reasonably have anticipated that the intervening cause would occur .<-->O
Of course , the law of negligence requires only that the entity take steps which a court deems to be reasonable , since entities can not effectively guard against all foreseeable harms , nor will the law require them to go to extremes and spend enormous amounts of money .<-->O

Secondhand tobacco smoke has been determined to be a known human carcinogen in the same category as asbestos , benzene , and Polonium 210 , and there is no safe lower level below which exposure has been shown not to cause cancer in humans .<-->N
Thus , both prudence and elementary fairness dictate that people especially young children should not be exposed at any level to such chemicals , and that the same strict policy of limiting even momentary exposure to asbestos should likewise apply to drifting tobacco smoke .<-->O

In this regard it should be noted that activities are often prohibited in public places simply because they may be annoying and irritating , even if they can not be shown to cause any significant harm .<-->O
For example , going topless , engaging in lewd and lascivious behavior , playing music very loudly , and other bothersome behaviors are often prohibited even though they pose no recognized health hazard .<-->O
Persons with heart problems and asthma , bronchitis or other lung ailments are particularly at risk when exposed to secondhand smoke .<-->O

For a youngster I did a pretty good job of swearing like a seasoned trooper because there is nothing quite like a cigarette butt burn on the sole of your foot to make your day ... I also recall the same thing happening to my young daughter many , many years later and if anything my anger and frustration with smokers was even greater .<-->O
Vernon , Fine way to kick butts , Gold Coast Bulletin , May 20 , 2004 .<-->N
Young children are also vulnerable to cigarette burns , especially when distracted by play on the beach , and especially if they come near a smoker who is holding a cigarette at his side as smokers frequently do .<-->O
This concern was one of the factors which led to smoking bans in some jurisdictions while people are waiting in line , where children have also been burned by cigarettes held at the side of a smoker and often at the eye level of a young child .<-->N
See earlier notes .<-->N
Actually , the case for liability is even stronger when the persons placed at risk by a practice here , permitting smoking are children ; children who are often too young to recognize or appreciate the danger and take steps to avoid it .<-->O
In short , the standard of care is higher when the potential plaintiffs are children , and juries are more likely to find liability in such cases , even if the carelessness of the smoker and/or the adult watching the child were also major factors .<-->O

Should Cities Ban Smoking in Public Places ?<-->F
By Edward L. Glaeser November 11 , 2008 8:31 am November 11 , 2008 8:31 am Edward L. Glaeser is an economist at Harvard .<-->F
One of my jobs is to be a booster for research on state and local government .<-->N
In that capacity , I m always a little sad that most people are captivated by the drama of presidential elections and bored by the nuts and bolts of local politics .<-->O
Much of what is most important in our lives the quality of our schools , the safety of our streets and the speed of our commutes is determined at the local level .<-->N
Today , states and localities are on the front line of regulating drugs and tobacco .<-->N
Last Tuesday , for example , Massachusetts decided to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana possession .<-->F
As marijuana heads towards legalization , tobacco seems headed in the opposite direction .<-->N
On Nov. 13 , the Boston Public Health Commission will consider a sweeping ban on tobacco consumption , which would end the city s four remaining cigar bars .<-->O
Does it make sense for localities to ban smoking tobacco and permit marijuana possession ?<-->N
The friends of liberty favor freedom to smoke either substance .<-->O
There is no reason to think that anyone s natural goal either is or should be to maximize lifespan .<-->O
The libertarian perspective is that individuals are the best judges of whether they want to take on the risks involved in either marijuana or tobacco .<-->O
Some people think that the libertarian viewpoint is undone by an increasing acceptance that people are not all that rational .<-->O
I disagree .<-->N
Accepting the limits on human rationality makes me more uncomfortable with allowing our elected or appointed officials to make decisions for us , because the effects of individual irrationality can be significantly increased when we delegate authority to elected officials .<-->O
In Boston , government officials want to de-normalize smoking .<-->N
In other places and other times , governments have wanted to de-normalize homosexuality .<-->N
Perhaps we are better off without trusting the state to de-normalize anything .<-->O
Yet there are good reasons to regulate smoking that reflect the costs that smoking imposes on third parties .<-->N
Friends , parents and children all suffer at the death of a loved one , which means that paternalistic interventions that reduce the risk of death can be thought of as tools to protect the social fabric .<-->O
The public health case against smoking emphasizes the consequences to third parties of second-hand smoke .<-->N
Reducing adult smoking may eliminate role models who lead children to light up .<-->N
After all , people do smoke less when their friends and peers and spouses stop smoking .<-->N
I m not sure that cigar bars create such large costs to outsiders , but perhaps de-normalization will induce a few fewer children to smoke , and it is hard to be against that .<-->O
This high-level discussion of the trade-offs between liberty and health ignores the local element that is the key attribute of the bans .<-->N
The bans in cities like Boston -LRB- and in New York , where smoking has been prohibited in almost all restaurants and bars since 2003 -RRB- are local ordinances , not global prohibitions .<-->N
Anyone who does not like them can move elsewhere .<-->N
Cities regulate plenty of behavior in public spaces , and it is well within the regulatory power of city governments to regulate smoking as well .<-->O
New York is surely seen by many as a more pleasant place because of Mayor Michael Bloomberg s smoking ban .<-->N
Some Asian cities , like Tokyo and Hong Kong , far less aggressively ban smoking within cafes or bars , but far more aggressively ban smoking in parks and on streets .<-->N
That seems at least as sensible to me as banning smoking in bars , which are generally off limits to children .<-->N
After all , no one ever confused a Blarney Stone with a health spa .<-->N
My own view is that there is not one right or wrong answer on smoking bans , which brings us back to the glories of local government .<-->O
Local rules allow people to choose a town with rules that work for them .<-->N
If parents want to bring up their children in a smoke-free environment , then it is a good thing that they can choose a town that bans smoking .<-->N
If twenty-something hipsters want to find a place where marijuana is treated liberally , then it is attractive that such places exist as well .<-->O
We can tolerate far more regulation at the local level than we ever should at the national level , because people get to choose their locality .<-->N
When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S. , Heath says 8 , or maybe even 6 .<-->O
No , the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk .<-->N
Instead he favors a cultural model , common in countries like France or Italy , where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals .<-->N
By doing this , he says , parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure , which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision .<-->O
`` In general , the younger people start to drink the safer they are , '' said Heath , who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol .<-->N
When introduced early , he said , `` Alcohol has no mystique .<-->N
It 's no big deal .<-->N
By contrast , where it 's banned until age 21 , there 's something of the ` forbidden fruit ' syndrome . ''<-->N
Of course , Heath 's idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon .<-->N
Thirty years ago this week , Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21 .<-->N
Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states -- and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 -- that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since .<-->O
Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens , whose brains are still developing .<-->N
But as the U.S. marks Thursday 's anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question : Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age -- or at least encouraging states to set their own limits ?<-->O
The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries -- Iceland , Japan , South Korea and Thailand are others -- with a minimum drinking age over 18 .<-->N
Several countries , including Belgium , Denmark and Germany , even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine .<-->N
`` I think 18 is viewed -LRB- by most countries -RRB- pretty much as a reasonable age limit , '' said Marjana Martinic , deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP .<-->O
`` The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S. , '' Martinic said .<-->N
`` Alcohol is seen more as a drug , and not something that 's integrated into everyday life . ''<-->N
MADD about underage drinking Two generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 -- or owning an ID that says you are to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar .<-->N
But in the wide-lapeled 1970s , things were very different .<-->N
After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18 , many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking .<-->N
The rationale went something like this : If young Americans could be entrusted to vote , serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam , why could n't they order a beer ?<-->O
By the late 1970s , more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages , usually from 21 to 18 .<-->N
But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states , state legislatures began to reverse course .<-->N
Mothers Against Drunk Driving , founded in 1980 , quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit .<-->N
On July 17 , 1984 , Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol -- effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages .<-->O
By 1995 , faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD , all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied .<-->N
Is alcohol and the teen brain a bad mix ?<-->N
Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law 's impact on public health .<-->N
One found that among young drivers -LRB- ages 16-20 -RRB- killed in car wrecks , the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61 % in 1982 to 31 % in 1995 -- a bigger decline than for older age groups .<-->N
`` Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved , '' said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement .<-->O
The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year .<-->N
`` Research shows that it saves lives , '' agreed MADD National President Jan Withers .<-->N
`` In fact , it is one of the most researched public health laws on the books .<-->N
When the law was raised to 21 , alcohol-related deaths for young people decreased ; when the drinking age was lowered , deaths increased . ''<-->N
A recent study in New Zealand , which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18 , found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury .<-->O
The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses , however .<-->O
A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age , significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age .<-->N
A stalled movement There 's a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S. , and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner .<-->F
He 's a university president .<-->N
Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College , John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing the 21-year-old drinking age as `` bad social policy and terrible law . ''<-->O
`` Right now we 're in an impossible position -LRB- on college campuses -RRB- .<-->N
Why should we be expected to enforce a law that 's ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come -LRB- to college -RRB- ? ''<-->N
McCardell , now president of the University of the South in Sewanee , Tennessee , told CNN this week .<-->N
`` It 's taking place behind closed doors , where it 's much more dangerous .<-->N
It 's unsupervised , '' he said .<-->N
`` It 's out of step with social reality . ''<-->N
CNN Opinion : Get real , lower drinking age to 19 Instead , he argues , colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly , within campus boundaries and out in the open .<-->O
In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative , which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that would n't penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21 .<-->N
He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators ' priorities turned elsewhere .<-->N
`` We missed our moment , '' he said .<-->N
Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18 , but none have gained traction so far .<-->N
Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election .<-->N
A 2007 Gallup poll found that 77 % of Americans opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18 .<-->N
`` There is n't much appetite to change something that appears to be working , '' said Martinic of ICAP .<-->N
`` It 's not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age , because nobody wants more traffic accidents .<-->O
It 's pretty much a no go . ''<-->N
But McCardell is not giving up .<-->N
He believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states , not the federal government .<-->N
And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit -- not unlike a driver 's license -- upon turning 18 , graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course .<-->N
They would need the permit to buy beer , wine or liquor , and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving .<-->O
All 50 US states have set their minimum drinking age to 21 although exceptions do exist on a state-by-state basis for consumption at home , under adult supervision , for medical necessity , and other reasons .<-->N
Proponents of lowering the minimum legal drinking age -LRB- MLDA -RRB- from 21 argue that it has not stopped teen drinking , and has instead pushed underage binge drinking into private and less controlled environments , leading to more health and life-endangering behavior by teens .<-->O
Opponents of lowering the MLDA argue that teens have not yet reached an age where they can handle alcohol responsibly , and thus are more likely to harm or even kill themselves and others by drinking prior to 21 .<-->O
The repeal of alcohol prohibition by the 21st Amendment on Dec. 5 , 1933 allowed each state to set its own alcohol consumption laws .<-->N
-LSB- 3 -RSB- At that time , most states established the MLDA for alcohol at 21 years of age , although two states set an MLDA of 21 for men and 18 for women : Illinois -LRB- 1933-1961 -RRB- and Oklahoma -LRB- 1933-1976 -RRB- .<-->O
The 1976 US Supreme Court case Craig v. Boren ruled 7-2 that this age difference violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment .<-->N
Following the July 1 , 1971 passage of the 26th Amendment , which lowered the legal voting age from 21 to 18 years of age , 30 US states lowered their MLDA to 18 , 19 , or 20 ; by 1982 , only 14 states still had an MLDA of 21Reports in the 1970 's showing that teenage car accidents increased in states where the MLDA had been lowered from 21 prompted Congress to pass the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 .<-->N
Although the Act did notrequire a national MLDA of 21 , it effectively mandated it by stipulating that some federal transportation funds would be withheld from states that failed to make 21 their minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcohol .<-->O
-LSB- 3 -RSB- Since 1984 , all states that had previously lowered their MLDA from 21 have all raised their MLDA back to 21 .<-->N
South Dakota and Wyoming were the last states to do so in 1988 .<-->N
-LSB- 3 -RSB- The consumption of alcohol by people under 21 is generally illegal across the United States , however , 45 states have set exceptions that allow underage consumption of alcohol in certain circumstances .<-->O
For example , underage drinking is allowed in 29 states if done on private premises with parental consent , 25 states if for religious purposes , and 11 states if for educational purposes .<-->N
While the MLDA is 21 in all 50 states , in 47 of 50 states age 18 is the `` age of majority , '' which entails having the rights and responsibilities of adulthood .<-->N
-LSB- 41 -RSB- Every state sets its own age of majority that often corresponds with the age at which one can vote , join the military , serve in jury duty , sign contracts , marry , apply for loans , make decisions regarding medical treatments , and be prosecuted as an adult .<-->N
Alabama -LRB- age 19 -RRB- , Mississippi -LRB- 21 -RRB- , and Nebraska -LRB- age 19 -RRB- are three states that have an `` age of majority '' above 18 , although certain rights such as the right to vote remain at 18 in these states .<-->O
-LSB- 41 -RSB- The discrepancy between the MLDA and the age of majority -- and its many responsibilities and authorities -- along with continued incidents of alcohol abuse reported on college campuses have fueled debate on whether or not setting the MLDA at 21 is fair , smart , and effective.Return the drinking age to 18 -- and then enforce the law .<-->O
The current system , which forbids alcohol to Americans under 21 , is widely flouted , with disastrous consequences .<-->N
Teaching people to drink responsibly before they turn 21 would enormously enhance public health .<-->O
Now , high school and college kids view dangerous binge drinking as a rite of passage .<-->O
Raising the drinking age to 21 has n't reduced drinking -- it s merely driven it underground , to the riskiest of settings .<-->N
The current law , passed in all 50 states in the 1980s , was intended to diminish the number of traffic deaths caused by young drunk drivers .<-->N
It has succeeded in that -- but tougher seatbelt and D.U.I. rules have contributed to the decrease , too .<-->N
Raising the drinking age has n't reduced drinking -- it s merely driven it underground , to the riskiest of settings : unsupervised high school blowouts and fraternity parties that make `` Animal House '' look quaint .<-->O
This age segregation leads the drinking away from adults , who could model moderation .<-->N
The roots of this extreme drinking lie in our own history .<-->O
Prohibition , which banned most alcohol in the United States from 1920 to 1933 , normalized the frenzied sort of drinking that occurs today at college parties .<-->N
In speakeasies and blind pigs , the goal was to drink as much and as soon as possible , because you never knew when the feds would show up .<-->O
Today 's law , likewise , encourages young people to dodge the system .<-->O
Like Prohibition -- and abstinence-only sex education -- it s been a dismal failure .<-->N
A 2009 study published in The Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs found that between 1998 and 2005 , the number of cases of alcohol poisoning deaths among 18 - to 24-year-olds nearly tripled , jumping from 779 cases to 2,290 .<-->N
The study also tracks a rise in fatalities from hypothermia and falls .<-->F
Some reports link excess drinking to sexual assault .<-->N
American 18-year-olds have the right to vote , marry , buy guns and join the military .<-->N
They 're astute enough to defend their country , decide elected officials and serve on a jury -- but not regulate their own appetites ?<-->O
They deserve the chance to learn .<-->N
We do n't hand teenagers car keys without first educating them about how to drive .<-->N
Why expect 21-year-olds to learn how to drink responsibly without learning from moderate models , at home and in alcohol education programs ?<-->O
In an effort to address student misconduct , the president of Dartmouth College in Hanover , N.H. , announced last month that hard alcohol would be banned on campus .<-->N
But many critics found the announcement bizarre , since at least half of college age kids are underage .<-->O
And singling out hard liquor seemed like an ineffective solution to bad behavior .<-->O
Is there a better way to deal with underage drinking ?<-->O
Should the drinking age , perhaps , be lowered ?<-->N
Critics of the current minimum legal drinking age argue that 21 is not working .<-->N
The data , however , suggest otherwise .<-->N
There is clear evidence that assaults increase sharply at age 21 , confirming a causal chain between alcohol and physical violence .<-->N
In a series of studies , my colleague Carlos Dobkin and I examined millions of young people age 19 to 22 using data from public health surveys , death certificates , arrest records and discharge reports from hospitals and emergency rooms across the country .<-->N
The results are striking and confirm that a minimum legal drinking age of 21 is working .<-->N
Alcohol consumption jumps sharply exactly at age 21 and remains elevated -LRB- i.e. , more than a one-time birthday-related drinking celebration -RRB- .<-->O
Deaths jump sharply exactly at age 21 by about 9 percent and remain elevated We could decrease death in America at a rate of 1.4 in 100,000 people by lowering the legal drinking age .<-->O
The death rate by alcohol per 100,000 people in America is 1.6 , making it 49th in the world .<-->N
The death rate by alcohol per 100,000 people in Italy is 0.2 , making it 163rd in the world .<-->N
The major difference in alcohol consumption between America and Italy is that in America it is illegal to buy alcohol under the age of 21 , while Italians over the age of 16 are allowed to purchase fermented drinks , like beer and wine .<-->O
As a child who grew up in Italy , I was familiar with alcohol from a young age .<-->N
From drinking communion wine at church to sipping champagne at New Year s Eve and being able to buy alcohol by the summer after tenth grade , I was never in awe of it .<-->N
It was just a part of life , like cars and pasta and teachers .<-->O
Potentially damaging in too large a dose , but overall not bad .<-->O
Coming back to America as a college student was a bit of a shock , because suddenly it was illegal for me to touch alcohol .<-->O
I could lose my license for driving with the tiniest hint of alcohol in my blood .<-->O
My parents could go to jail for offering me a sip of champagne on New Year s Eve .<-->N
My future could disintegrate in front of my eyes if I were in the wrong situation at the wrong time .<-->O
The closer it got to my 21st birthday , the bigger of a deal it became .<-->N
I go to a school where we sign contracts saying we won t drink while we re enrolled , but there is an underground network of people who drink .<-->N
For the months leading up to my birthday , I was bombarded with questions : Are you excited you can drink now ?<-->N
-LRB- from those who don t attend the school -RRB- Have you decided whether you re going to drink ?<-->N
-LRB- from people at my school -RRB- Make sure you stay safe and don t drive , -LRB- from those who didn t care either way but wanted to make sure I didn t die -RRB- And that in itself was a big thing .<-->O
The thought that going out for a drink could result in my death how have we , as a culture , come to a place where that is an acceptable and normal thing to worry about ?<-->O
It does not have to be that way .<-->N
My friends in Italy didn t spend their weekends going out to get drunk for the fun of it .<-->O
My friends in America think getting drunk is a high form of entertainment , possibly the highest .<-->O
Perhaps if they had been exposed to alcohol at an earlier age , it would not present itself as such an intoxicating , unreachable thing .<-->O
If the drinking age in America were lower , children might be forced to first experience alcohol with their parents , in safe places like their own homes .<-->O
Italian children know what alcohol is from the time they are young , and when they turn 16 and are allowed to buy it , it doesn t present the same temptation it does for American children .<-->O
Viewpoint : Why America should lower the legal drinking age By the time I turned 21 and was allowed to legally drink in America , I had been drinking for years .<-->N
I had tasted beer , whiskey and wine .<-->N
The prospect of going out to get a drink didn t thrill me to my core it was more like being able to go see a movie .<-->O
Italian children are allowed to buy their drinks while they are still under their parents control .<-->N
This gives the parents the ability to say when they can go out and drink , who they can drink with and how much they can drink .<-->N
By the time Americans start buying , they are independent and can drink whatever they want with whoever they want whenever they want .<-->O
That s a lot of power , and I don t believe they are raised to be able to handle it .<-->O
Alcohol accounts for a large percentage of all traffic deaths in the United States .<-->N
It is a huge concern , and should be treated as one .<-->O
Students should be educated about it the same way they are educated about sex , and the drinking age should be lowered to allow parents to oversee their children s first drinks .<-->O
Simple measures like these could decrease drinking deaths exponentially .<-->O
The Debate On Lowering The Drinking Age 60 Minutes Last fall , a group of over 100 college presidents - including the heads of Dartmouth , Virginia Tech and Duke - signed a declaration stating that the 21-year-old drinking age is not working , and fireworks went off .<-->N
But the college presidents got what they wanted : a national debate about the drinking age .<-->N
When the age was raised to 21 in the mid-1980s , the goal was to reduce highway fatalities .<-->N
But everyone knows that the 21 age limit has n't stopped minors from drinking .<-->N
And now some experts believe it 's actually contributing to an increase in extreme drinking .<-->O
This is what the former president of Middlebury College in Vermont , John McCardell , believes and it 's why he started the movement dedicated to lowering the age back to 18 .<-->N
It may seem counterintuitive , but he argues that lowering the age will make kids safer .<-->N
It 's like the old days of prohibition : from the suburbs to college campuses to inner cities , kids find ways to get around the 21 year old limit .<-->N
As McCardell puts it , it 's so widespread , it 's the norm .<-->N
`` This law has been an abysmal failure , '' McCardell told 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl .<-->N
`` It has n't reduced or eliminated drinking .<-->N
It has simply driven it underground , behind closed doors , into the most risky and least manageable of settings . ''<-->O
Like basements , fraternity houses and locked dorm rooms , where kids go to hide from the law and from adults , including parents , who might teach them some moderation .<-->O
McCardell says the law has created a dangerous culture of irresponsible and reckless behavior , unsupervised binge and extreme drinking , like something called `` Six in Ten '' - downing six cups of beer in ten seconds , kids trying to perfect the art of getting drunk as fast as possible by playing drinking games .<-->O
And pre-loading - downing as much of the forbidden fruit as possible before going out in order to avoid getting caught drinking in public .<-->O
`` It 's bad law in that it is unwork -LSB- able -RSB- .<-->N
It 's bad social policy , '' McCardell said .<-->N
Asked if it is unworkable or people just do n't enforce it , McCardell told Stahl , `` The issue of enforceability is present .<-->O
But the fact is it is so regularly and routinely avoided , that enforcement results in two arrests or convictions for every thousand violations . ''<-->N
Mark Beckner , the chief of police in Boulder , Colo. - a college town - deals with underage drinking every day .<-->N
`` We 're not in a situation where we can stop it .<-->N
The best we can do is try to contain it , '' he told Stahl .<-->N
`` So you 're basically telling us that you simply ca n't enforce the law .<-->N
They are drinking and you can not enforce it , '' Stahl remarked .<-->N
`` Well , we do enforce it , '' Chief Beckner replied .<-->F
`` But what we 're seeing is it 's not being effective . ''<-->N
Beckner has tried many different kinds of enforcement techniques over the years , including strict crack-downs .<-->N
`` We 'd find a party where we know there 's underage drinking .<-->N
We would seal the house .<-->N
Surround the house with officers and we would write every single underage person coming out of that house .<-->N
We wrote hundreds and hundreds of tickets those years .<-->N
All we did is we pushed it further underground , '' Beckner told Stahl .<-->N
For that reason , he is one of the few chiefs of police in the country who publicly agrees with McCardell , and supports lowering the drinking age .<-->N
Asked what the advantage is to lowering the age to 18 , Beckner said , `` The overall advantage is we 're not trying to enforce a law that 's unenforceable .<-->O
The abuse of alcohol and the over-consumption of alcohol and DUI driving .<-->N
Those are the areas we 've got ta focus our efforts .<-->N
Not on chasing kids around trying to give 'em a ticket for having a cup of beer in their hand . ''<-->N
Part of Beckner 's jurisdiction is the University of Colorado at Boulder , known as one of the country 's top party schools .<-->N
Boulder was the scene of the terrible tragedy of Gordie Bailey .<-->N
Gordie was 18 , a freshman at the University of Colorado in 2004 .<-->N
He had been there only one month when he underwent a Chi Psi fraternity initiation with 26 other pledges also underage .<-->N
Leslie and Michael Lanahan are Gordie 's mother and stepfather .<-->N
They say the pledges were asked to drink 10 gallons of hard alcohol and wine in half an hour .<-->N
`` You were certainly viewed as a better man if you could handle more , '' his mother said .<-->O
Asked how much Gordie actually drank , his stepfather told Stahl , `` He had had 15 to 20 shots if you had to measure it .<-->N
They were not putting it into shots and drinking it .<-->N
It was just guzzling out of the neck of the bottle . ''<-->N
By the time the group got back to the fraternity house , Lanahan says that Gordie was incapacitated .<-->N
`` His eyes were rolling back in his head and he could n't walk .<-->N
This is n't something somebody who 'd just had too much to drink .<-->O
He was clearly in trauma . ''<-->O
Lanahan says that the fraternity brothers put Gordie on the library couch , and just left him there , alone .<-->N
`` The president of the fraternity did ask several brothers at intervals to go in and take Gordie 's pulse , as if to say ` Tell me if he 's alive or dead . ' ''<-->N
Lanahan told Stahl Gordie lay passed out on a couch for nine hours , until someone called 911 for help .<-->N
`` We got a guy who 's passed out .<-->N
He drank way too much and we found him this morning , '' a student told a 911 operator .<-->N
Asked if Gordie was breathing , the student told the operator , `` I do n't know .<-->N
He 's not waking up . ''<-->N
`` Gordie died alone in an empty room with his friends surrounding him .<-->N
And it 's just very preventable .<-->O
Just inexcusable , '' Lanahan told Stahl .<-->N
Gordie died of alcohol poisoning .<-->N
To try and prevent another senseless death , the Lanahans have created the Gordie Foundation to spread the word about the dangers of alcohol abuse , and recently released `` Haze , '' a film about excessive drinking on college campuses .<-->O
`` If the drinking age had been 18 instead of 21 , would the kids have called for help when Gordie passed out ? ''<-->N
Stahl asked Leslie Lanahan .<-->N
`` I think so , '' she replied .<-->N
`` So because it was illegal you think that 's why they did n't call ? ''<-->N
Stahl asked .<-->N
`` I think that 's right , '' Lanahan said .<-->O
Asked if he agreed with that , Michael Lanahan told Stahl , `` Well , they had alcohol in the fraternity house which was against their policy .<-->N
They had minors buying the alcohol , serving the alcohol to minors .<-->N
They had to make a decision about what they were going to do and unfortunately they made the wrong decision . ''<-->N
60 Minutes : Some Say Age Should Be Lowered To 18 , But MADD And Others Strongly Disagree ?<-->N
John McCardell points to the story of Gordie Bailey as one reason he supports lowering the drinking age to 18 which after all , he says , is the age when we 're considered adults for most things , like firing a weapon and putting you 're your life on the line in battle .<-->O
`` Why do n't we trust these young adults to make the same kind of responsible decisions about alcohol that we believe them capable of making in the voting booth , in the jury box , on the battlefield ? ''<-->O
`` The inconvenient truth is that a drinking age at 18 would cause more funerals .<-->O
Nine hundred families a year would have to bury a teenager , '' said Chuck Hurley , the executive director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving or MADD .<-->N
MADD was a major force behind raising the drinking age to 21 back in 1984 because of increased traffic fatalities from drunk , teenage drivers .<-->O
`` When the United States reduced its drinking age in the seventies it was a public health disaster .<-->N
Death rates in the states that reduced their drinking age jumped 10 to 40 percent , '' Hurley explained .<-->N
He told Stahl one could see an immediate jump in fatalities after the age was lowered .<-->N
`` When the drinking age was increased , the fatalities fell . ''<-->N
After the drinking age was raised to 21 , the number of traffic fatalities among 18 to 20 year olds declined by 13 percent , which is why Hurley has some public health organizations on his side .<-->N
`` We 're delighted to be working with the American Medical Association , with the National Transportation Safety Board , with the National Safety Council , with the International Association Chiefs of Police , with the Governor 's Highway Safety Association , with the Surgeon General of the United States , with the U.S. Transportation Secretary , '' Hurley told Stahl .<-->N
`` There are a list of impressive organizations that have lined up against you , '' Stahl told John McCardell .<-->N
`` They feel that you have no data to back up what you 're saying .<-->N
That what you 're proposing would be basically an experiment . ''<-->N
`` Well , I think that first of all we need to understand that lives are being put at risk off the highways in increasing numbers year by year as a result of this law , '' McCardell replied .<-->O
`` Increasing numbers , '' Stahl remarked .<-->N
`` That number of lives lost to alcohol by 18 to 24 year olds is going up at an alarming rate .<-->N
It is n't just about lives lost on the highways , '' McCardell replied .<-->O
So what we have is a conundrum : a law that has reduced highway deaths may , according to McCardell , be contributing to an increase in off-highway deaths .<-->N
The surgeon general says more than 3,000 Americans under the age of 21 are dying every year of alcohol-related causes other than driving including homicide , suicide , and alcohol poisoning .<-->N
The chilling statistics appear to have little impact on behavior .<-->N
As evidenced by a quick tour of the Internet , Web sites glorify excessive drinking and even teach kids how to do get loaded in a few seconds .<-->O
These drinking tips are so common and popular , YouTube and CollegeHumor.com are used like instruction manuals .<-->O
Chuck Hurley of MADD says the answer is not lowering the age to 18 .<-->N
That , he contends , would just increase the availability of alcohol to even younger adults .<-->O
`` Guess what 's gon na happen in high school ?<-->N
Literally the trickle down approach . ''<-->N
`` So what you 're saying is 18 year-olds today get 21 year-olds to go get them liquor .<-->N
You 're saying 15 year-olds would get the 18 year-olds to do that ? ''<-->F
Stahl asked .<-->F
`` Yeah , that is what we 're saying , '' Hurley replied .<-->N
`` If the age were 18 , would it be easier to enforce ?<-->N
Then you 'd have 17 year-olds .<-->N
You 'd have to enforce it against them , '' Stahl said .<-->N
`` Is it your goal to eliminate all drinking among people under 21 ? ''<-->N
`` Yes , '' he said .<-->N
Asked if that 's realistic , Hurley said no .<-->N
`` Well , our goal really would be in an ideal world to eliminate underage drinking . ''<-->O
But he acknowledged that that 's a difficult goal to achieve .<-->N
John McCardell thinks even aiming for abstinence is impractical .<-->N
And besides , he thinks the real problem is alcohol abuse - excessive and binge drinking .<-->O
And so he has a proposal that accompanies his plan to lower the age to 18 .<-->N
`` Alcohol education is what we need and that is a very important part of our proposal .<-->O
And by that I do n't mean temperance lectures and I do n't mean prohibition , nor do I mean encouragement to drink , '' he told Stahl .<-->O
What he does mean is mandatory classes in high school that would include the chemistry of alcohol , the physical consequences of abuse , and sitting in on AA -LRB- Alcoholics Anonymous -RRB- sessions .<-->O
Passing an exam would result in a license to drink .<-->N
`` So what you 're saying is alcohol education would be like driving education , '' Stahl remarked .<-->N
`` That 's a good analogy , '' McCardell replied .<-->N
`` You 'd have to take the course , there 'd be a test , you 'd get the license .<-->N
If you violate it , the license is taken away ? ''<-->N
Stahl asked .<-->N
`` Right away , that 's right , '' McCardell said .<-->N
`` And think about that analogy .<-->N
It would never occur to us to say to a young person once they reach driving age , ` Here are the keys .<-->N
Good luck .<-->N
Go figure it out . ' ''<-->N
McCardell thinks this idea - testing and licensing - is better than leaving things the way they are .<-->O
Given the vast opposition to lowering the age , his chances of succeeding are sLower the Drinking Age Back to 18 : We Do n't Have Students Teach Each Other to Drive , Why Is Alcohol Different?lim , but as a history professor he says it comes down to what we already know .<-->O
`` We have lived through prohibition .<-->N
We know prohibition does n't work , '' he said .<-->N
`` We know that on our college campuses .<-->N
We know that in our households .<-->N
We know that in the military .<-->N
We know that in non-college America as well .<-->N
Legal age 21 seeks to impose prohibition on young adults .<-->N
And that 's the way , and in my view , the only way to look at this question . ''<-->N
The decision of Dartmouth College to ban hard liquor on campus has rekindled a debate about the 21-year-old drinking age .<-->N
Dartmouth is heading in the wrong direction .<-->N
Instead , policymakers should be following the advice of about 150 university and college presidents who signed the Amethyst Initiative and advocate for the Choose Responsibility proposal and reduce the drinking age back to 18 .<-->O
Let me explain .<-->N
As both a professor of public health and the parent of a 25-year-old , 23-year-old and 16-year-old , I have very strong feelings on the matter -- both professional and personal .<-->O
When I was coming of age in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the drinking age was 18 .<-->N
During our crucial senior year in high school , most students were lawfully able to drink beer , wine and hard alcohol .<-->O
Kegs of beer were commonly served at dances , proms and graduation events where parents and proctors were present .<-->N
When I entered Cornell University , the president of the university , Frank Rhodes , invited freshmen to a reception that served champagne and strawberries on the terrace of his spectacular home overlooking the campus and Cayuga lake .<-->N
I felt very grown up and elegant , sipping champagne while discussing the nuances of the book freshmen were required to read for orientation .<-->O
After declaring my major , I was regularly invited to department events that included a lecture from a visiting scholar followed by a wine and cheese reception .<-->N
The debates begun at the reception not infrequently spilled over to the campus pub .<-->N
Like many campuses , our pub served as an inexpensive , convenient and supervised gathering place for students to go after studying at the library and before heading back to the dorm .<-->O
In my day , learning how to drink socially and responsible was not just part of the college experience , it was an at least partially supervised college experience .<-->O
Students would drink with faculty and staff , who could model appropriate alcohol-related behavior .<-->O
On campus drinking was out in the open .<-->N
The bartender at our on-campus pub was paid by the university and was charged with watching the crowd and cutting off students who had overdone it .<-->N
Of course , these civilized , faculty-infused events were not my only exposure to on-campus drinking .<-->N
There were also a lot of drunken frat bashes .<-->N
When I worked as a resident advisor , I learned that many alcohol-related dangers occurred in large , drunken , unsupervised events .<-->O
Many were frat parties .<-->N
Although we did not yet have a term to define the phenomena , I met girls -LRB- especially freshman -RRB- who fell victim to date rape .<-->O
Often the rape followed a visit to a party where the beer was dispensed from a truck .<-->N
There were students who suffered alcohol poisoning during rush and nightlong `` rooms parties '' -LRB- where a different drink was served from a punch bowl in each frat room -RRB- .<-->N
There were frat brothers that began their life-long struggle with alcohol addiction while indulging in a never-ending house keg .<-->N
So lowering the drinking age clearly will not bring all on-campus drinking in the open .<-->O
Or eliminate all irresponsible on-campus drinking .<-->N
Lowering the drinking age will mean that half the campus -LRB- the youngest , least adapted , first-time-away-from-home half -RRB- is not required to hide their activity because it is illegal .<-->O
And college campuses could then sponsor events that encourage appropriate use of alcohol , rather than just lecture about poor , illegal use .<-->O
Allowing open use and modeling the appropriate use is a core message from the college and university presidents adhering to the Choose Responsibility pledge .<-->O
My biggest frustration with the 21-year-old age limit is that it makes it illegal for parents to lawfully teach their own kids how to drink responsibility while still in the home .<-->O
Kids should go to college understanding exactly how his or her body tolerates alcohol .<-->O
Podium lectures can not explain whether it takes one or five beers to produce bed-spins ; or cause a hangover the next morning .<-->N
Jewish teenagers often learn at Passover that drinking the ceremonial four cups of wine during the Seder celebration can lead to an unplanned , early bedtime -- and perhaps a headache the next day .<-->O
As a group , perhaps Jews have a statistically lower incidence of alcoholism .<-->N
Nobody would suggest that I send my kids to college and have a group of non-driving youngsters teach each other how to drive .<-->O
Yet that is exactly what we as parents are lawfully required to do with alcohol .<-->N
The 21-year-old age limit forces law-abiding young citizens to begin their encounter with alcohol usually two years after they graduated from high school when off living on their own .<-->O
We do n't do that with driving .<-->N
Why does it make sense for alcohol ?<-->N
The Drinking Age Should Be Lowered , FastIt will soon be rush time for fraternities and sororities on college campuses .<-->N
That means dressing up , networking , socializing , attending parties and staying up late nights .<-->N
It also means , whether parents know it -LRB- or like it -RRB- or not , astonishing amounts of drinking of very potent liquor .<-->O
One of the most famous drinks is called jungle juice : trash barrels filled with random spirits and mixtures , consumed one red cup at a time .<-->N
Many of these kids are away from home for the first time , able to drink to their heart s content .<-->O
A huge culture has grown up around this practice , including a full vocabulary , games and rituals .<-->N
Mostly it is just fun , but it can also lead to serious trouble for everyone involved .<-->O
Let s not be squeamish : it leads to very un-adult-like amounts of personal abuse and , often , the abuse of others .<-->O
Most of these kids have never been socialized in what it means to drink responsibly .<-->N
They are living for the thrill that comes with defiance .<-->O
The combination of new freedom , liquor and sexual opportunity leads to potentially damaged lives .<-->N
How do these kids get away with this ?<-->N
In fraternities and sororities , it all happens on private property , not public and commercial spaces , and so campus police can look the other way .<-->N
Most everyone does .<-->N
Indeed , being able to drink with friends , and unhampered by authority , is a major appeal of the Greek system on campus .<-->O
It s a way to get around the preposterously high drinking age .<-->N
Getting around this law will consume a major part of the energy and creativity of these kids for the next three years .<-->O
As for everyone else who can not afford to join , it s all about a life of sneaking around , getting to know older friends , lying and hiding , pregaming before parties just in case there is no liquor there , and generally adopting a life of bingeing and purging , blackouts and hangovers , rising and repeating .<-->O
And so on it goes for years until finally the dawn of what the state considers adulthood .<-->O
For an entire class of people , it s the Roaring Twenties all over again .<-->N
It s all part of Prohibition s legacy and a reflection of this country s strange attitudes toward drinking in general .<-->O
The drinking age in the United States -LRB- 21 -RRB- , adopted in 1984 , is one of the highest in the world .<-->N
Countries that compare in severity are only a few , including Indonesia , Kazakhstan , Cameroon , Oman , Pakistan , Qatar , Sri Lanka and Tajikistan .<-->N
Most of the rest of the world has settled on 18 for liquor and 16 for beer and wine .<-->N
In practice , most European countries have very low enforcement of even that .<-->O
Somehow it works just fine for them .<-->O
The consequences of this draconian law have been terrible for American society .<-->O
Teenage drinking is a gigantic part of American life , all done surreptitiously and mostly without responsible oversight .<-->O
The market for fake IDs is ubiquitous and diffuse .<-->N
Everyone in the United States has a story of kids and their abusive habits , their strategizing , their hidden flasks and risky games , their constant maneuvering to do what they know they are not supposed to do .<-->O
The drinking-age law would surely be a winner in a competition for the least obeyed law .<-->O
The notion that this law is accomplishing anything to actually stop or even curb teen drinking is preposterous .<-->O
Instead , we see all the unintended effects of Prohibition : over-indulgence , anti-social behavior , disrespect for the law , secrecy and sneaking and a massive diversion of human energy .<-->O
People speak of a rape crisis on campus , and whatever the scope of the problem , the fact that women under 21 must retreat to dorm rooms and frat houses to drink puts them all in a vulnerable situation .<-->O
It s hard to imagine that consent is really there when people are falling down , passing out and feeling mortified the next day about what happened .<-->O
In fact , the law represents a true danger to women in particular because it prohibits legal access to safe public places to drink responsibly , and go home to a safe environment afterward .<-->O
There is an organization of college administrators who are fed up .<-->N
It is called the Amethyst Initiative .<-->N
Currently , 135 colleges have signed support for a lower drinking age .<-->N
Their goal is not to encourage more drinking but to recognize the unreality of the current law , and how it has led to perverse consequences on campus .<-->N
You know the situation has to be extremely serious to get this risk-averse crowd on board .<-->O
It s not just about campus .<-->N
It s about teens and drinking in general .<-->N
The law requires them to hide in private places .<-->N
Such clandestine meetings can lead to compromising and dangerous situations without reliable public oversight .<-->O
It s also about business .<-->N
Convenience stores and bars , in particular , have been put in a strange position .<-->O
They have been enlisted to become the enforcement arm of an unenforceable policy , which has meant haranguing customers , inventing new systems for ferreting out violators , turning the servers into cops , confiscating IDs and creating an environment of snooping and threats in a place that should be about service and fun .<-->O
Why isn t something done to change this ?<-->N
Those who are most affected have the least political power .<-->O
By the time they figure out the ropes in American political life , they are turning 21 and so no longer have to deal with the problem .<-->O
In practice , this means that there is no real constituency pushing for reform of these laws .<-->N
That s why they have persisted for 30 years without serious pressure to change , despite the obvious failure they have been .<-->O
There is some movement at the state level .<-->N
In Missouri , longtime state Representative Phyllis Kahn has worked for a lowering of the drinking age in her state .<-->N
She has an interesting take on whether this would mean that the state would have to give up 10 percent of federal highway funds -LRB- the threat that the feds used to force states to raise their drinking ages -RRB- .<-->O
In 2012 , a Supreme Court ruling on Medicaid clearly stated that the federal government could not coerce states by withdrawing funding to force legislative action at the state level .<-->O
Other activists have said that even if the federal highway funding is cut , the increase in revenue from alcohol sales -LRB- and decline in enforcement costs -RRB- could make up a lot of the difference .<-->O
Regardless of the financing issues , current drinking-age law is unenforceable and destructive .<-->N
The reality is that kids are going to drink .<-->N
Denying that and imposing ever more draconian punishments doesn t fix the real problems with alcohol .<-->O
What we need is a normal environment of parental and community supervision so that such drinking can occur in a responsible way .<-->O
Yes , kids will probably drink more often , and yes , more kids will probably try alcohol , but they can do so in an environment of safety and responsibility .<-->O
Bringing it into the light , rather than driving it underground , is the best way to solve bingeing and abuse .<-->O
Doubling down on a bad rule , rooted in the idea that laws can change human desire , is not a workable solution .<-->O
The choice between virtue and vice is a human choice .<-->O
Relying on the government to make this choice for us disables the social order s internal mechanisms for bringing about and rewarding responsible behavior .<-->N
It seems like a paradox , but it is true : The only path toward restoring sanity in teenage drinking is greater liberty .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 Young adults in college wo n't get in trouble with the law If teenagers were allowed to drink at the age of 18 far less people would be getting in trouble with the law .<-->O
Since 18 is the age many enter into college , it will be about the time that many take their first sip of alcohol as well .<-->N
Though there is a fair share drinking in high school , the consumption of alcohol increases greatly once in college .<-->O
Being a college student myself , I know that a very large percentage of the campus population engages in illegal consumption on a weekly basis .<-->O
At the same time , these young adults are getting in trouble with the law by receiving Minor in Posessions or having their fake ID confiscated .<-->O
By lowering the legal drinking age to 18 , most college students would be allowed to drink without the worries of getting caught .<-->O
If they are old enough to live on their own and take responsibility for their school career , they should be responsible enough to drink Lowering the legal drinking age would only result in more fake IDs being made for underaged people looking to buy alcohol .<-->O
Since many teenagers can look quite a few years older than they actually are , it would not be hard for some to pass as eighteen .<-->O
I have seen many underaged people drinking who have never proven that they were responsible enough to even be left home alone .<-->O
Lowering the age would not suppress minors ' urge to drink , but rather increase their ability to obtain alcohol illegally since fewer people would be in need of someone old enough to buy the alcohol for them .<-->O
Just because a young person is considered old enough to be living on their own , does not mean that they are capable of doing so responsibly .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 Lowering the age will cut down on young adults drinking Though many do wait to take their first sip of alcohol until college , there are still the rebels sneaking drinks into the high school football games .<-->O
They know the risk of getting caught , they know what their consequences will be , so why do it ?<-->O
It 's fun , it 's exciting !<-->O
It 's the rush of doing something they are not supposed to be doing and sneaking around .<-->N
If it was made legal , there would n't be quite as much excitement and thrill .<-->O
Also by the time they finish college , these young adults would not feel the need to do it as much since they will have been drinking for quite a few years , therefore , allowing them to focus more on their school work and not become consumed by the alcohol .<-->O
Though many do dare to drink while under-aged , there are some that are waiting to become legal to drink and buy it for others .<-->N
Lowering the legal drinking age would only allow them to buy alcohol for even more minors to drink , which will most likely still be illegal to do .<-->O
All a party would need is a few people legally able to drink to talk to the police and make it look like everyone is legally able to drink at the party .<-->O
It is n't so much the thrill of knowing there are consequences if caught drinking illegally , but really just the feeling of being intoxicated appeal to them .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 If you can fight for your country in Iraq , why ca n't you have a beer ?<-->N
Young men who barely look old enough to be holding a gun are fighting for our country and risking their lives everyday .<-->O
Yet you are going to tell me they ca n't crack a beer open after fighting all day in the hot desert and being a shot at ?<-->O
That hardly seems fair .<-->N
If these men and women are allowed to leave their homes in America for months and even years at a time , have the power to shoot and kill people , go on covert operations , and be put in the line of fire , they rightly deserve to engage in drinking .<-->O
If our country thinks that 18 year olds are capable of all of the above , then they should certainly be responsible enough to drink .<-->O
drinking alcohol and fighting for your country are two defferent things , because if they drinking one beer and lead to another and another they can drink all night and wake up with a hang over or not slepp all and be drunk the can kill on of there own and but at risk our country .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 they drink anyway why not let them do it legaly teens all over drink anyways legal or not just let them do it legaly .<-->O
yuo here of parties during the weekends .<-->N
on collage campus .<-->N
no matter the consequense teens will still drink illegaly .<-->O
so qhy not change it ?<-->N
Allowing teenagers to drink at the age of 18 wo n't ensure that they drink responsibly - just that they ca n't be punished for it !<-->O
The teenage brain is not a developed as the 21 year old brain and they will more likely hae a drinking dependency or liver damages before they can even drink legally .<-->O
Thousands are admitted to university hospital each year for alcohol poisoning .<-->N
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 you can vote at 18 why cant you drink ?<-->N
if you are smart enough to vote why cant you drink .<-->N
You are being trusted to make a smart decision and if you can be trusted there why not when you drink .<-->N
becouse drinking is a responsability that teens are not ready for , because the need to know how much is enough and they dont .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 If you can drive a lethal weapon -LRB- moterized vehicle -RRB- why cant you drink ?<-->O
You are being trusted to make at least 5 decisions at once -LRB- speed , worring about other people , direction , changing lanes , talk , ect ... -RRB- why cant you drink .<-->N
A 16 year old can drive as well .<-->N
Do you really a sophmore kid drinking and driving as well ?<-->O
In fact do you want anyone drinking and driving .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 The min drinking age in Canada is generally 19 and 18 in Quebec So American students drive across the border to Canada , drink and then drive back .<-->O
The point behind drinking laws is make sure students aged between 18 and 21 do not drink and endanger themselves or others ; however this has proved practically counterproductive as driving drunk from Canada back to the U.S can not be good for anyone .<-->O
we 're not canada .<-->N
and you do n't even support your argument .<-->O
therefore your argument falls and should not be considered at all .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 2 19 out of 50 U.S states have not specified that 21 is the min drinking age so it is n't technically illegal .<-->O
There are territories within the U.S that are not U.S states , which again have no specific lower age-limit for drinking alcohol .<-->N
however it also said : `` Exceptions to the 21 law in some states include possession for religious purposes when accompanied by a parent , spouse or legal guardian ; medical reasons ; in private clubs or establishments ; in the course of lawful employment by a duly licensed manufac '' that means that the age for drinking is still 21 .<-->O
also your argument does n't cover the fact that people under 21 can drink with their parents consent .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 Being able to drink wo n't keep them out of all trouble You cant keep everyone out of trouble , there are all ways going to be some idiots .<-->O
The reason young people drink now is because the thrill of breaking the law and then once they had the drink they will do it again because its fun and it feels good .<-->O
Just because 18 year olds are allowed to drink , does n't mean they wo n't do stupid things after being inhibited by alcohol .<-->O
Many college aged students do n't see the risk of drinking and driving , they look at it as , `` Will I get pulled over ? ''<-->N
So by allowing them to drink legally , that 's only clearing one hurdle for them , they will then assume that with only one obstacle left they 're in the clear .<-->O
That 's obviously not the case .<-->N
They could get behind that wheel and kill not only themselves , but other passengers , and even worse , other innocent drivers .<-->O
It 's no secret that alcohol impairs judgement , and an 18 year old 's judgment is not always the wisest to begin with .<-->N
After a few drinks , wanting to liter , vandalize , and be disruptive or destructive can often times seem like a good idea .<-->O
Doing any of the above could potentially cause the law to become involved and other charges could be pressed , thus it does n't really matter if someone is legal to drink or not .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 Young adults drinking could cause more problems in the future The current drinking age is 21 , but are n't there still 25 year olds drinking and going to the bars ?<-->O
So if the age becomes 18 , there will still be plenty of 21 year olds drinking .<-->O
Lowering the age would only allow people to start their habit at an even younger age .<-->O
This could lead to more and more adults suffering from alcoholism .<-->N
By starting at 18 , kids will be able to build a tolerance to alcohol and by the time they get to college they will be experienced drinkers .<-->O
Instead of saving their fun for the weekend like most college students , they will feel the need to drink through out their school week , therefore falling behind on their studies and even potentially losing their social life and friends .<-->O
This ultimately would lead to failing out of school , not being able to hold a steady job , and not being able to get the job that a college education could have gotten them .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 The law is the law Just because something has been around does not mean it should not be changed .<-->O
to say that we should not change something merely because we have n't changed it YET is a large logical fallacy .<-->O
Since 1984 the law has been 21 years old to consume alcohol .<-->N
The age to fight ?<-->N
Think back to World Wars and battles before , we had boys , and when I say boys I mean children as young as six or seven on the battlefield .<-->O
Our country is one of tradition and not much for change .<-->N
The drinking age was set 24 years ago and has not been touched since , we accept that for what it is , and it is mainly young adults and teens in high school who argue with it .<-->O
The age now to fight for our country is 18 , only three years younger than the drinking age .<-->N
It 's not that long to wait in reality .<-->N
And most people are generally proud to go fight for their country , if they sign up it is because it 's something they want to do .<-->O
Though drafts have been instated before , it has been several years , so those willing to sign up for the military know what they are getting themselves into .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 from 21 should the drinking age be lowered First of all Negatives do n't write in the yes box and same goes vise versa , positive 's .<-->O
Second do n't write a comment when you are Oh So obviously drunk .<-->O
And last but not least the drinking age should be lowered to 18 if not even lower because you can posses and shoot a lethal weapon at the age of 12 to go hunting .<-->O
Also you need to view it from a different perspective , I am going to assume that most of the people writing the negatives are fully grown and have kids , I can understand your worries for the safety for your family and friends but if you look at it from the young adults point of view .<-->O
They are going to war to fight for us so we do n't have to fight for our selves and do n't you think they would want to die the next day having had fun the day before drinking and partying it up with friends the day before .<-->O
You know unless you decide to go to war and fight side by side with your son or daughter .<-->O
And if you are a smart a ** i am sure you would n't , once they reach 18 they can do any thing they want except drink , they are not the little kids you once knew .<-->O
They are adults who are old enough to adopt a child , go to war , vote , and even sign a binding contract knowing the consequences and benefits and also knowing that their mommy and daddy are n't there to solve the problem .<-->O
My solution I think is obvious , lower the drinking age but raise the age you need to be to drive , just like the Europeans .<-->O
In fact when you think that your kid is stupid because of the alcohol just keep in mind that they are not , they are stupid because of how you raise them to view homework and school and how the school runs .<-->O
When I was growing up my parents gave me priorities and they were School and homework first , chores , and then play .<-->N
Next there is the school i have seen teachers barely pass their students just because they do n't want them in their class again next year and also because of sports .<-->O
seniors rule the school and know how the system works so they can slide on by getting the bare minimum , but if you went to Europe or China or even Mexico the schools are tougher because the standards are higher .<-->O
i think the drinking age shoi = uld be lowered to 15 because they are already doing it anyway so why should they stand around for time when the could just walk right in i tink the drinkingmage shouldent be lowered because is the law i hate it when the law changes stuoid things but not the secrousily ones like fighting an drugs and why people shouold go to jail even if they havent done anything wrong The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 It is true that the human brain does n't stop developing until 25 .<-->O
The drinking age is 21 to protect the brain but the law does n't do any good if the majority of young adults do n't follow it .<-->N
The United States spends far too much money fighting a useless battle .<-->O
If a young person wants to drink then they will .<-->N
It would be cheaper and much more beneficial if the government stopped trying to criminally charge underage drinkers and educate them about the dangers of over consumption instead .<-->O
This would lower binge drinking and drunk driving accidents .<-->N
I also believe that if you 're old enough to get blown up by an IED in Iraq or anywhere else , then you 're old enough to have a beer in your own country .<-->O
If it were n't for soldiers , no one would be in America drinking alcohol .<-->N
If nothing else , let those that serve in the military drink .<-->N
They deserve to be able to do what they chose .<-->N
Studies have proven that alcohol impairs mental development .<-->N
Young people , who continue development into their late twenties , would be seriously hurt by the passage of such a law .<-->O
many people drink alcohol before the reach the age of 21 .<-->N
however a large portion do it only a small period of time before they hit 21 .<-->N
because they think that as they approach the age of 21 it 's ok for them to drink .<-->N
some of my friends .<-->N
the law keeps some people -LRB- such as myself -RRB- from drinking until 21 .<-->N
if the law were to change so that consuming alcohol would be legal at the age of 18 , many people would try it even earlier .<-->O
their brain would be damaged even more than 21 .<-->N
America is already in a bad state .<-->N
We dont need more people wasting their brains on early alcohol .<-->O
The USA legal drinking age should be lowered to 18 The drinking age should be 21 years of age .<-->N
Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives .<-->N
There are multiple ways to die from alcohol : alcohol poisoning , drunk driving , and many other ways .<-->N
No doubt about it , alcohol just starts trouble .<-->O
Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is ?<-->N
It isn t texting or any usage of the phone .<-->N
It is fully driving under the influence .<-->N
Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence .<-->N
People also die from alcohol poisoning , this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries .<-->O
In America , the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years .<-->N
It isn t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented .<-->O
Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol .<-->N
Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected -LRB- positively -RRB- by this law .<-->N
Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment .<-->O
Although , this isn t always true .<-->N
Some children may like the taste , and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot .<-->O
Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning .<-->N
When you are around the teen \ preteen age , your brain is maturing .<-->F
Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells .<-->N
You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen , but you d be incorrect .<-->N
The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five .<-->N
People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage People want what they can t have .<-->O
Although this may seem true , which it is , it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount .<-->O
This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age .<-->N
You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are .<-->N
Depending on the country some don t have a drinking age limit at all .<-->N
You may think that those countries do well , but they have a lack of government .<-->O
One of those countries is Jamaica , the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot .<-->N
How is that right ?<-->N
Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure ; many even lack government .<-->O
That should make it common sense that we shouldn t be like those types of countries , many of which are a part of the developing world .<-->O
They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol , when they could be buying resources like food , water , clothing , and or shelter .<-->O
Parents don t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better .<-->O
Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing .<-->N
People also think that their children don t have access to alcohol , but when it comes right down to it , putting it on the top shelf won t stop them .<-->O
They have resources from school and other places such as -LRB- if you live in a big city -RRB- they can get it from almost any street side marketer .<-->O
In 1996 , 308 children died from alcohol poisoning ; in 1997 , 342 children died from alcohol poisoning ; and in 1998 , 300 children died from alcohol poisoning .<-->N
As you may already be noticing , this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults .<-->N
-LRB- Yoon , Stinson , Yi , Dufour -RRB- In 1984 , the law of minimum drinking age was made to be 21 .<-->N
Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21 , but you weren t allowed to buy it or handle it either .<-->N
Although , 19 states messed up when writing the law ; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal , they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal .<-->N
This law never mentions underage drinking , yet people still don t do it in those states .<-->N
This shows that people know what not to do , proving that it is only an act of common sense .<-->N
-LRB- Hanson -RRB- Prohibition is what started the whole legal drinking age thing .<-->N
The law was there before Prohibition , but wasn t really enforced .<-->N
Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it , but after Prohibition , it was considered a misdemeanor .<-->N
It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate .<-->N
When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty - one , and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down .<-->O
-LRB- Whitehead , Williams -RRB- Some people even believe that twenty - one years of age is too young to start drinking because the human brain is not fully developed at that age .<-->O
Although this is true , some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty - one .<-->O
If some people believe that twenty - one may even be too young , how can eighteen even be close ?<-->O
It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty - five .<-->N
Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times .<-->O
When it comes right down to it , they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured , not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered .<-->O
People get offended when you tell them that they aren t old enough to do something , and teens don t really even care if they can drink or not .<-->O
In the end , they just don t want to be told that they can t do something .<-->O
Drinking will end someone s childhood .<-->N
Sometimes it will end more than just the kid s childhood .<-->O
Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision , so they allow them to do so .<-->O
But , in reality , it is harmful for children , or anyone for that matter , to drink .<-->N
Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do .<-->O
The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more .<-->O
The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child .<-->N
You have to tell them some things , but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs .<-->N
Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children , who die from an alcohol and or drug related death , have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts .<-->N
Many people have become interested in this topic .<-->N
There are people on either side of the argument , but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side .<-->N
So many lives have been saved by this law ; in fact , this law has saved more lives than most laws combined .<-->N
It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4 % under-aged people have use alcohol , and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4 % .<-->N
this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be .<-->N
If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to , they will do it .<-->O
Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens .<-->O
Recently , a news station did a report on peer pressure .<-->N
They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck .<-->N
After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck .<-->N
-LRB- The news team was trying to see if only one or two would get in the truck or if all three got in because of each other -RRB- .<-->N
The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation .<-->N
The third kid was very cautious , but even he got in the truck .<-->O
It is the same way with alcohol , if 90 % of a party is drinking , chances are the other 10 % will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool .<-->O
Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body .<-->O
It will hurt you no matter what age you are .<-->O
Sometimes it will affect your mind , other times your body .<-->O
People don t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven t ever read a document like this before .<-->O
People who drink don t even realize how much it will affect their social status , no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend .<-->O
Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect .<-->O
It is sad to see this happening to someone , but you must know that it is their own fault .<-->O
People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy , unwanted , unloved , just plain old disliked .<-->O
Don t be the town drunk , but don t be the person who pities him either .<-->N
Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well .<-->N
You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money .<-->N
Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck , he is unemployed , and he is an alcoholic .<-->O
You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types , but in reality studies have proven these to be true .<-->O
It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it , have it stolen from them , spend it on beer or drugs , or just waste it .<-->O
It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18 % of the time .<-->N
18 % just think about that number for a while .<-->O
Lowering the drinking age will have some bad effects .<-->O
We should do it anyway .<-->N
For the first time in decades , the legal drinking age is back in the news , and nearly all the credit for that belongs to the Amethyst Initiative .<-->N
Signed by 136 college presidents from across the country , the initiative calls on Congress to revisit the 31-year-old Uniform Drinking Age Act , which deducts 10 percent of the federal highway funds from any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 .<-->N
For more than a quarter-century , no state has dared violate it .<-->N
Amethyst is a worthwhile initiative .<-->N
It s one I support .<-->N
And given the proper framing and strategy , I believe it s one that can prevail .<-->N
But success will not come without a forthright and realistic assessment of the likely consequences of lowering the drinking age .<-->O
They won t all be positive .<-->N
The wrong approach , in my view , is the line of argument made by John McCardell , the former Middlebury College president who founded the pro-drinking-age-reform organization Choose Responsibility in 2007 .<-->O
Most advocates for lowering the drinking age repeat some variation of what McCardell told CBS 60 Minutes in 2009 : This law has been an abysmal failure , McCardell told 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl .<-->N
It hasn t reduced or eliminated drinking .<-->N
It has simply driven it underground , behind closed doors , into the most risky and least manageable of settings .<-->O
Clearly , the analogy McCardell is drawing is to the War on Drugs , and to Prohibition before it .<-->N
But there are some pretty obvious ways that the analogy is inapt .<-->O
The true folly of both Prohibition and the War on Drugs is the ways both enriched the violent criminal gangs who administer the black market .<-->O
That s just not true of the national drinking age ; today s alcohol producers and distributors are legitimate and , for the most part , law-abiding .<-->O
That the barrier between licit and illicit alcohol use is sometimes porous doesn t render a convenience store into the Medell n Cartel or InBev into Al Capone .<-->N
Moreover , the analogy to the War on Drugs breaks down when you consider the nature of the products in question .<-->O
Those who oppose the War on Drugs favor legalizing marijuana a popular , but largely benign vice and decriminalizing harder drugs that are much more destructive , but thankfully , also much less popular .<-->O
Alcohol has the unfortunate distinction of being both very popular and for many , though not most , of its consumers also very destructive .<-->O
Alcohol s more destructive effects , and the role the national drinking age has played in tempering them , have left a rather inconvenient paper trail of data .<-->O
This data can , has and will continue to be summoned readily by opponents to undermine the credibility of those who would characterize the law as an abysmal failure .<-->O
It also doesn t help when some advocates of lowering the drinking age seek to apply the Prohibition analogy in ways that stretch credulity .<-->N
Writing in Newsweek , Jeffrey Tucker of the Foundation for Economic Education essentially made the claim that lowering the drinking age would help solve the campus rape problem : People speak of a rape crisis on campus , and whatever the scope of the problem , the fact that women under 21 must retreat to dorm rooms and frat houses to drink puts them all in a vulnerable situation .<-->O
It s hard to imagine that consent is really there when people are falling down , passing out and feeling mortified the next day about what happened .<-->O
In fact , the law represents a true danger to women in particular because it prohibits legal access to safe public places to drink responsibly , and go home to a safe environment afterward .<-->O
Tucker is certainly right to highlight the role Greek life appears to play in campus sexual assault , given multiple studies showing that fraternity members are three times more likely to commit rape than other college men , and that sorority members are 74 percent more likely to be victims of rape than other college women .<-->O
Of course , this was also a problem back in the 1970s , when the drinking age in many states was lower , and it s not at all clear how lowering the drinking age would address the many issues raised by Greek life .<-->O
It s also not clear why retreat -LSB- ing -RSB- to dorm rooms , presumably to drink with friends , would be less safe than the obvious alternative bars filled with intoxicated strangers .<-->O
Ironically , arguments like Tucker s may actually be overstating alcohol s role in sexual assaults .<-->O
While alcohol is not infrequently a tool of rape , that is quite a different thing than being a cause of rape .<-->N
According to a 2001 study from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , alcohol use by either the perpetrator or the victim was present in about half of all sexual assaults .<-->N
A sexual predator was present in 100 percent of them .<-->N
The problem of rape on campus is not that there are too few legal ways to get alcohol .<-->N
The problem is that there are too many rapists on campus .<-->N
They ll be on campus whether the drinking age is 21 or 18 , and alcohol is but one of many tools at their disposal .<-->N
In any case , making it easier for them to buy alcohol does not seem likely to decrease the incidence of rape .<-->O
So , before some other advocate seeks to make a similar counter-intuitive claim that lowering the drinking age would help reduce college suicides or drunk-driving accidents , it d be useful to recap how we got here and why the original push to lower the drinking age was broadly considered a failed experiment .<-->O
In 1971 , the 26th Amendment was ratified , extending the right to vote to 18-year-olds .<-->N
Two years before the amendment s passage , the drinking age in all but a handful of states was 21 .<-->N
In the spirit of the times in-line with the slogan if I m old enough to die for my country , I should be old enough to vote/drink between 1969 and 1973 , 26 states reduced their minimum drinking age .<-->O
Four others would lower their drinking ages in the following years .<-->N
In truth , the extent of the change tends to be somewhat exaggerated in the public imagination .<-->O
There were actually only 21 states , representing about 42 percent of the population , that ever lowered the drinking age to 18 for all forms of alcohol .<-->N
On the flip side , there were a dozen states , representing 27 percent of the population , that never lowered the drinking age from 21 .<-->N
States where it remained 21 to buy hard liquor covered 47 percent of the population .<-->N
But just as Oklahoma was becoming the last state to lower its drinking age , in 1976 , there was an almost immediate reversal .<-->O
Minnesota raised its drinking age in 1976 , just three years after lowering it .<-->N
In 1977 , it was Maine that raised the drinking age .<-->N
In 1978 , it was Iowa and Michigan -LRB- twice in one year , in the latter case -RRB- .<-->F
In 1979 , it was Massachusetts , Montana , New Hampshire and Tennessee .<-->F
In 1980 , it was Illinois , Nebraska , New Jersey , Georgia and Rhode Island .<-->F
In 1981 , it was Texas , Virginia and Rhode Island -LRB- again -RRB- .<-->F
In 1982 , it was Maryland , New York , Connecticut and Ohio .<-->F
In 1983 , it was Alaska , Oklahoma , North Carolina , West Virginia , New Jersey -LRB- again -RRB- , Virginia -LRB- again -RRB- and Connecticut -LRB- again -RRB- .<-->F
In 1984 , the Uniform Drinking Age Act was passed and , by the end of 1988 , every state had a drinking age of 21 .<-->F
So what happened ?<-->F
In brief , drunk-driving fatalities by young people skyrocketed .<-->F
In Arizona , the state Department of Public Safety estimated that traffic fatalities spiked more than 35 percent when the drinking age was lowered .<-->F
In Michigan , the proportion of 16 - to 20-year-old drivers with blood alcohol concentrations over 0.05 more than doubled .<-->F
A 1984 paper by Philip Cook and George Tauchen estimated that in states that lowered the minimum age to buy beer to 18 , overall fatalities among the 18-to-20-year-old age group rose 11 percent .<-->N
The trend reached what the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety deemed to be epidemic proportions .<-->N
By the time it peaked in 1982 , 61 percent of 16 - to 20-year-old drivers killed in car crashes had illegal blood alcohol levels .<-->N
A decade after passage of the national 21 minimum drinking age , that had fallen in half , to 31 percent .<-->N
To be sure , just as not all of the increase in drunk-driving fatalities was due to the lowered drinking age , nor was all of the decrease due to the national age limit .<-->O
Harvard University economist Jeffrey Miron found in a 2007 paper that most of the improvement was attributable to states that voluntarily raised their age limits before the federal mandate , and that the effect did not persist for long .<-->O
The generally accepted realistic figure for the UDAA s impact comes from a 1999 paper by Georgia Tech s Thomas Dee , who found that raising the national drinking age reduced traffic fatalities by at least 9 percent .<-->N
Of course , these are not the only relevant data .<-->N
There are studies to support findings that teens from states with higher drinking ages drank less frequently .<-->O
That states with lower drinking ages had higher rates of vandalism .<-->N
That the move to lower the drinking age was correlated with a 10 percent increase in the rate of suicide by young people in the relevant age bracket .<-->O
One can no doubt find quibbles with the data or the methodology of all of these .<-->N
But there is an impressively thick literature of findings , and attempting to knock them down one by one is simply a losing battle .<-->O
Let s just be honest .<-->O
Lowering the national drinking age back to its pre-1984 levels will have some bad effects .<-->O
We should do it anyway .<-->N
We should do it because 18-year-olds are adults .<-->N
They vote .<-->F
They pay taxes .<-->F
They serve our country in the military .<-->N
They sign contracts and testify in court .<-->N
They get married .<-->N
They buy property .<-->F
They start businesses and hold down jobs .<-->N
There is no moral foundation for the proposition that they can participate in the full panoply of rights and responsibilities that this country provides , except for choosing which beverage they d like to consume .<-->O
We should do it because the Uniform Drinking Age Act violates the principles of federalism .<-->N
There is no constitutional justification for the federal government to regulate the age at which someone should be legally permitted to consume alcohol .<-->O
We knew this when we passed Prohibition .<-->N
It s why it took a constitutional amendment to enact .<-->N
The 21st Amendment returned authority over the regulation of alcohol to the states , and that s where it should have remained .<-->N
The precedent set by NFIB v. Sebelius , wherein it was ruled unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold funding for states that refused to expand their Medicaid rolls , should be applied to the UDAA .<-->O
The law demands a fresh challenge .<-->O
We should do it because , in short order , self-driving cars will render much of the discussion about drunk-driving fatalities utterly moot .<-->O
Finally , we should do it because public policy can not properly be guided only by an accounting of costs .<-->N
We must also consider benefits .<-->O
People like drinking alcohol an awful lot .<-->O
That counts for something .<-->N
Alcohol abuse can cause a variety of harms , but only a relatively small fraction of the people who drink alcohol drink abusively or ever experience such harms .<-->O
Americans spend $ 90 billion a year on alcohol , including $ 5.5 billion spent by students .<-->N
No market could be so large without producing enormous consumer surplus , and no policy analysis is complete that fails to account for that surplus .<-->O
Alcohol provides delicious flavors and aromas in a never-ending diversity of forms .<-->N
It is a means of social bonding that has been with us since prehistoric times and has been the subject of probably more songs and poetry than any other , save love and death .<-->N
It is the reason we have agriculture and , thus , the reason we have civilization at all .<-->O
We should lower the drinking age because young people deserve to experience the same joy of drinking alcohol that the rest of us do .<-->O
It is , quite simply , a central part of what it is to be human .<-->O
Why We Should Lower the Drinking Age Prohibition doesn t work .<-->N
A legal limit of 21 does not stop people under 21 from consuming alcohol .<-->N
Americans under 21 years old continue to use alcohol despite the law .<-->N
Legal age 21 fosters unsafe drinking habits .<-->N
The 21 year-old drinking age has pushed young adult and adolescent drinking behind closed doors and away from supervision by parents , residence life staff , and other adults authority figures .<-->N
90 % of the alcohol consumption by individuals between 18-20 years old is done while engaging in binge drinking behavior .<-->N
Lowering the drinking age gives guardians more options .<-->N
A lower drinking age would allow parents , families , and other guardians to instill safe drinking practices with their children .<-->O
As it is , people who begin drinking at an early age do not have a safe avenue to learn about sensible drinking choices , and must do so behind closed doors , increasing their risk of unsafe drinking habits .<-->O
Legal age 21 is inconsistent with our definition of adulthood .<-->N
The drinking age is the only exception to the legal age of adulthood in the US .<-->N
We consider 18 year-olds to be adult enough to vote , serve in the armed forces , enter into contracts , marry , and even serve on juries .<-->O
Legal age 21 is inconsistent with our notion of what it means to be an adult in the United States .<-->N
What Needs to Change The National Minimum Drinking Age Act ties states to a minimum drinking age of 21 in order to avoid a 10 % reduction in each state s federal highway appropriation .<-->N
Federal legislation must be enacted that would not penalize states for deciding appropriate drinking ages amongst themselves .<-->O
This could come about in a variety of ways : Repeal of The National Minimum Drinking Age Act Exemptions granted to states who embark on pilot programs and conduct thorough research within federal guidelines How SSDP Chapters can Change the Law Student government resolutions A legal drinking age of 21 significantly impacts undergraduate students , a majority of whom fall in the age range of 18-20 years old and still use alcohol .<-->O
Your student government represents you .<-->N
Approach them and ask them to pass a resolution calling for the repeal of The National Minimum Drinking Age Act .<-->F
Better yet , get elected to student government and pass the resolution yourself .<-->F
Lobby your school s President to sign the Amethyst Initiative Launched in July 2008 , the Amethyst Initiative is made up of chancellors and presidents of universities and colleges across the United States .<-->N
These higher education leaders have signed their names to a public statement that the problem of irresponsible drinking by young people continues despite the minimum legal drinking age of 21 , and there is a culture of dangerous binge drinking on many campuses .<-->O
The Amethyst Initiative supports informed and unimpeded debate on the 21 year-old drinking age .<-->N
Amethyst Initiative presidents and chancellors call upon elected officials to weigh all the consequences of current alcohol policies and to invite new ideas on how best to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol use .<-->N
I live in New Orleans , a city not especially noted for sobriety .<-->N
We have no legal closing time for bars , so last call changes depending upon demand .<-->O
You can carry your drink out of a bar and on to the street as long as it s in a plastic cup .<-->N
The state has drive-through daiquiri stands , for pete s sake .<-->N
At our airport terminal , there s a big advertising banner for a local hospital declaring Number # 1 in Liver Transplants .<-->N
I often see arriving visitors standing underneath giving a thumb s up in selfies .<-->N
Yet few I know who actually live here seem to take the city up on this invitation to ceaseless tippling .<-->O
When friends and I wander down Bourbon Street , it s usually on a vaguely anthropological mission , a field trip to see how those from more locked-down cultures handle their liquor when those strictures are lifted .<-->N
Often , the picture isn t pretty .<-->N
I was thinking about this recently when reading about the backlash triggered by the Rolling Stone article chronicling rape culture and binge drinking at the University of Virginia .<-->N
The tale is grim , recounting an alleged gang rape at the Phi Kappa Psi house in 2012 .<-->N
It s peppered with sociopathic predators preying on guileless , wide-eyed first-year women , plying them with potent , sweet drinks at frat parties before closing the trap .<-->N
The ruthlessness is only heightened by either the audacity or cluelessness of the perpetrators .<-->O
I wanted to thank you for the other night , said the UVA frat brother who set the trap , when he later ran into his victim on campus .<-->N
I had a great time .<-->N
But the piece looked beyond a single episode at a single university .<-->N
It indicted a nationwide university culture in which predators are protected by administrators worried more about prestige and reputation than student safety .<-->O
It noted that 86 universities are currently being investigated by the Obama administration for civil right violations for ignoring sexual violence complaints .<-->O
The piece makes a strong case that a major upheaval on college campuses is essential to right long-standing wrongs .<-->O
This points to an entrenched cultural problem in student life , UVA president Teresa A. Sullivan , told the New York Times .<-->N
Cultural shifts are seismic and slow .<-->N
But in the meantime , an improvement could be made by doing something more swift and immediate : eliminating federal penalties for states that lower the drinking age back down to 18 or 19 .<-->O
This may seem counterintuitive .<-->N
Isn t drinking a large part the problem ?<-->N
Out-of-control drinking came up in a fraught emergency meeting of UVA overseers this week .<-->N
Some commenters on the Rolling Stone website demanded stricter enforcement of alcohol stricture such as more stringent policing of fraternities against underage drinking .<-->O
Yet the fact remains : college students under the age of 21 are going to drink .<-->N
To believe otherwise is to believe in unicorns .<-->O
The question then is chiefly , where are they gong to drink ?<-->N
In a place that s reasonably safe , or less so ?<-->O
By lowering the drinking age , it s possible to coax the party out of the demimonde and into a better-lit public realm .<-->N
The immediate benefits are considerable .<-->O
Lowering the legal drinking age breaks the lock that fraternities and dorm rooms and off-campus housing currently have as the only places to drink Offering an alternative changes the dynamic in which vulnerable students feel they have no choice but venture into potentially unsafe places .<-->O
Socializing and drinking in public places with more observers instantly raises the threshold of getting away with misbehavior .<-->N
In a brighter light amid a more diverse crowd , those contemplating a crime will know they re being watched , and the likelihood of someone intervening if a situation becomes unwise rises .<-->O
A lowered drinking age reduces the push for pre-gaming of gathering in private spaces to drink fast and hard early on before setting out .<-->N
It spreads consumption across an evening , where one s metabolism has a fighting chance of matching consumption .<-->N
But perhaps most of all , by bringing drinking back into a larger social sphere , it allows for better examples of how to drink , and a more open discussion of what s sensible and what s not a discussion that 's impossible to have have when drinking starts by jumping over a wall and into the shadows .<-->O
Drinking is at a cultural apogee now : craft cocktails and microbrews and obscure wines have never been more present in the nation s cultural conversation .<-->N
Of course it intrigues .<-->N
And by making drink part of a daily routine earlier one , there s less need to bust loose and go wild when the opportunity presents itself .<-->O
It benefits all to create a culture that embraces moderation rather than prohibition .<-->O
I have a friend , the father of two daughters , who told me he doesn t like to drink around his kids because he doesn t want them to associate alcohol with enjoyment .<-->O
When he told me that , I got the feeling that something is very broken .<-->N
Since the first wild yeast introduced itself to the first Paleolithic hunter-gatherer , drinking has been part of global culture , helping humans to unclench and unwind , to cement ties with friends and family , and to reduce social inhibitions .<-->N
My experience in New Orleans is that beneath the rowdy surface , a freer drinking culture is considerably saner than in other places .<-->N
The lack of a mandated bar closing time means less pressure for customers to order up and guzzle when last call comes around , and results in fewer drunks piling onto the street all at once .<-->O
And during the night , when a group of drinkers moves on to the next place , there s no need for the slower drinkers to chug and move on they just pour what s left into a go-cup and move on .<-->O
So many of the rules meant to protect society from drinkers and drinkers from themselves inadvertently have the opposite effect .<-->N
Yes , I know : Drinking and young adults ends poorly .<-->O
Studies show that heavy drinking can affect their cognitive development .<-->N
And drinking and driving remains a persistent problem .<-->N
Handing someone a beer at the same time that you hand them their first driver s license is not a move out of the common sense playbook .<-->N
Yet there are ways to encourage more responsible drinking .<-->N
As author William Cohan suggested in an essay earlier this year , why not reduce the drinking age while shifting to a zero-tolerance policy for alcohol and driving , thereby sending a less ambiguous message : If you drive , don t drink .<-->O
Not even a drop .<-->N
In 2008 , more than 100 college presidents signed on to the Amethyst Initiative , calling for a rethinking of the current drinking age .<-->F
Twenty-one is not working , they wrote .<-->N
A culture of dangerous , clandestine binge-drinking often conducted off-campus has developed .<-->N
It s high time for that discussion to resume .<-->N

The normal curriculum can only ... Co-curricular activities prepare students practically for the future .<-->N
The normal curriculum can only go so far as to teach and educate students about academic theories .<-->N
But students whose only experience of school or college is one of rigid academic study may not be able to apply what they have learned in practice .<-->O
If the co-curriculum was given an equal footing in student life there will be an improvement in the student ability to grasp things as a whole , because students will have received a more rounded education .<-->O
Co-curricular activities are particularly good at providing opportunities for students to work in teams , to exercise leadership , and to take the initiative themselves .<-->N
These experiences make students more attractive to universities and to potential employers .<-->N
The academic curriculum is really much more important and must continue to be given more status in schools and colleges than the co-curriculum .<-->O
Students are meant to be receiving an education and gaining recognised qualifications .<-->N
Higher Education institutions place a greater importance on the curriculum than the co-curriculum when selecting students , and so do employers .<-->N
Co-curricular activities are nice , but they have never been shown to actually play a vital role in a student s life .<-->O
And if they distract students from focusing on their academic qualifications , then they could be actually harmful .<-->O
Co-curricular activities in schools Most co-curricular activities are physically active , getting the student out from behind their desk ... Most co-curricular activities are physically active , getting the student out from behind their desk and making them try new things .<-->O
This is healthy and ensures that students are exposed to practical tasks , not just what is taught in class .<-->O
The outcome of giving the co-curriculum the same status as the curriculum will therefore be well balanced individuals .<-->O
Future politicians , for example , will not only thrive on law or social studies , but will also become fluent in multiple languages , learn to tango and perform several calculus operations simultaneously , while also experiencing service through community work .<-->O
Such are the more profound benefits of the co-curriculum being integrated into the syllabus .<-->N
There is no obvious logic in having super talented individuals , instead society should lean itself towards making specialised individuals in their selected fields .<-->O
Most modern careers require expert knowledge and skills , which can take years to acquire .<-->O
We should not distract a student from developing skills in whatever selected field he or she has chosen to specialise in .<-->O
After all , when you see a doctor or employ an engineer , you are not interested in how well-rounded they are , just in whether they are good at their job .<-->O
And the Prime Minister does not play soccer or tango in the House of the Commons , therefore they do not require such skills as part of their formal education .<-->N
Co-curricular activities in schools Having a wide range of experiences prepares people better for the future , especially in today s unce ... Having a wide range of experiences prepares people better for the future , especially in today s uncertain world .<-->O
The broad education that the co-curriculum can provide is better preparation for life in a society where an individual may change career several times in their life .<-->O
Students must therefore have a fundamental grasp of multiple skills .<-->O
For instance , athletes who had their career cut short due to mishaps might venture into business , having had co-curricular experience of entrepreneurship as part of their education .<-->O
Speech and debate clubs might give a doctor or engineer the communication skills to move into broadcasting , teaching , or even politics .<-->O
Placing more emphasis on the co-curriculum thus ensures a variety of possibilities for young people to choose from instead of being sidelined .<-->N
Most specialist professions still provide a range of career opportunities , without any need to compromise academic education by over-emphasis on non-academic activities .<-->O
For example , athletes who have been injured in mishaps can continue their career in the same field but just in a different post .<-->N
No longer could they play , but they could still coach or even give sports science lectures to aspiring super stars .<-->O
And if someone does wish to radically switch career in mid-life , there are plenty of evening classes and continuing education opportunities to allow them to retrain .<-->O
Co-curricular activities in schools Students have a right to a broad education .<-->O

Why should a science student have to give up music , or a social studies major not get opportunities for sport ?<-->N
Many children have talents in all sorts of different areas , and it is wrong to force them to specialise too early .<-->O
A career is not the only part of an adult s life school needs to make sure they have interests and skills that will help them in their family and leisure lives too .<-->O
Through equal balancing of academic and co-curriculum , however , the students have the chance to exercise their rights and the opportunity to be multi-talented .<-->O
Lopsided individuals are not the key to the future , instead by recognising each individual by their talents there exists a higher possibility for young people to learn and to grow in their studies .<-->O
Choice works two ways .<-->N
If co-curricular activities are so good , then students should have right to choose whether they wish to pursue them , rather than forcing them to give equal importance to something they do not wish to do .<-->O
Through equalising the demands of academic and co-curriculums there exists the possibility that a student may drop out because he or she may not be able to cope with the demands of both sets of activities .<-->O
The right to an education is best exercised by giving students the choice to decide what field their lives would like to be based on , and about how to pursue these aims .<-->O

They may instead waste their time lazing around , or maybe even making trouble .<-->O
These young people do not know what they are missing ; if they could be made to try other activities they would surely enjoy them and gain a lot of benefit .<-->O
If the co-curriculum was given formal importance , with students required to undertake at least one activity , then more people would try new things , and discover they like them .<-->O
Making extra-curricular activity compulsory will take the fun out of it and strip it of its benefits .<-->O
Successful extra-curricular groups work precisely because the students have voluntarily chosen to be there .<-->N
If some were forced to take part , they would be less enthusiastic and spoil the activity for the rest .<-->O
And the more the activity is like ordinary school , the less attractive it will be to young people .<-->O
Most of the personal development benefits associated with extra-curricular commitments such as altruistic service , initiative-taking , and leadership skills come from the voluntary nature of the activity .<-->O
If that voluntary aspect is removed , then the benefits are lost too .<-->O

Sta ... An ambitious co-curricular programme is quite affordable for schools and colleges of all kinds .<-->O
State schools in Singapore and many public universities in the USA are able to offer strong co-curriculums , and elsewhere many state-funded institutions have thriving extra-curricular activities .<-->O
Most co-curricular pursuits are not expensive to run , and those activities that might be more expensive , such as military cadet groups and science clubs , can often apply to outside agencies for funding .<-->O
Staff often given their time free , because they believe the activities are worthwhile for the students and enjoyable for themselves to run , and many groups can also be supported by unpaid volunteers from the wider community .<-->O
Giving a greater place in education to the co-curriculum means that many more clubs and activities will have to be organised for students .<-->N
This will be very expensive as it will require more staff and more resources to be paid for .<-->O
This explains why most schools that currently offer a large co-curriculum are well-funded fee-paying institutions .<-->N
Most ordinary schools , dependent on state-funding , will never be able to match this spending and could not aim to offer an ambitious co-curriculum .<-->O
If they try , it will be at the expense of more important academic activities .<-->O
Co-curricular activities in schools Many towns today do not have a strong civil society , and in more rural areas there may be no groups ... Many towns today do not have a strong civil society , and in more rural areas there may be no groups at all for young people to join outside school .<-->O
If schools and colleges do not provide opportunities for youngsters to broaden their experiences , then students will not get them at all .<-->N
Boosting the place of the co-curriculum in schools is one way of addressing this weakness in modern society , as it will equip young people with the civic spirit , initiative and organising skills to set up their own clubs , teams and activity groups when they leave education .<-->O
Finally , a successful co-curriculum often depends on building links between the school and the wider community , bringing local enthusiasts in to work with students , and sending students out to work on community projects , help in primary schools , perform for local audiences , etc. .<-->O
Giving co-curricular activities greater importance in education can be harmful to civil society as a whole .<-->O
There are many clubs , teams and groups available for young people already in most areas e.g. Scouts , religious work , music , drama , sport , voluntary work in the community , etc. .<-->O
Why should these be ignored and only those done in school given academic credit of some kind ?<-->N
Often pursuits offered by schools end up replicating those already available in the wider community .<-->N
For example , a school hockey team may deprive the local town s hockey club of young players , while school adventure activities might weaken the community s Scouting and Guiding groups .<-->O
So a strong co-curriculum may have the effect of killing off lots of worthwhile community-based activities because they do not receive school credit .<-->N
This would be a shame as a strong civil society is vital to a thriving democratic culture , but also because groups that involve people of all ages possess great social and educational value .<-->O
Network Blog Why our students need co-curricular , not extra-curricular , activities Skills development should be embedded in academic programmes , rather than an add-on , to give students the best chance of shaping their future , says Marilyn Andrews As January 's High Fliers report shows , the gratuate job market in 2013 is one of the most competitive we 've ever known .<-->O
Time and time again employers tell us that a degree alone is not indicative of a well-rounded graduate .<-->N
So what can universities do to provide further development opportunities to complement the academic curriculum ?<-->O
I strongly believe that given the right tools , students will thrive in taking charge of their own development , but to help them do this , we need to reassess our role as higher education providers .<-->O
We should not just provide the opportunities for students to achieve good academic results but actively promote the benefits of a wider curriculum to students .<-->O
After all , university should be seen as a transformative experience through which students can prepare themselves to succeed in the many and varied roles they will undertake in future life .<-->O
That 's why , over the last few years , Keele University has evaluated its offering to recognise the importance and value of both academic curriculum and co-curricular activities in developing the range of skills and attributes that are important for graduates .<-->O
Armed with a better sense of the student journey , the university has designed a ` development strand ' to support students ' transition through higher education and enable them to take responsibility for their own development .<-->O
This is n't a marketing exercise , but an approach that has been implemented for all new Keele students and places the onus on them to shape and develop their studies and interests with life after university in mind .<-->N
But in real terms how have we changed ?<-->N
Let 's start with the academic curriculum : thanks to the introduction of a new degree structure in 2009 , undergraduate students can build a degree to suit their own interests and aspirations .<-->O
The curriculum enables students to develop their subject knowledge , academic literacy and a range of complementary capabilities .<-->N
We also make our degrees as flexible as possible , so for example arts students can study modules in forensic science and maths , while science students can study media , politics or history a clear message to employers of an appetite and capability to learn new knowledge and skills .<-->O
Then there 's the co-curriculum meaning any activities that fall outside the academic degree .<-->N
We have invested resources to offer a comprehensive range of co-curricular activities , be it sports , societies , part-time work , entrepreneurial schemes or volunteering .<-->N
We encourage students to recognise the value of these activities as part of their development in other words co-curricular , not extra-curricular .<-->N
Engagement with non-academic pursuits is not only beneficial to student development , but is known to be highly valued by employers .<-->N
It may seem like a small change , but by demonstrating to students that we view these activities as equally important to academic study , we encourage participation .<-->O
What 's more , many of these activities are formally recognised on the student 's HEAR -LRB- Higher Education Achievement Record -RRB- .<-->N
But the most important change at Keele has been the introduction of the development strand in our curriculum , which relates to effective study practices , and personal , professional and career development .<-->O
These activities help students make sense of , and take responsibility for , their learning and future .<-->O
Students are encouraged to engage with these activities through a variety of opportunities from thematic practical workshops to online seminars .<-->N
These opportunities are embedded within the academic programmes , but also offered as stand-alone events throughout a degree rather than being an afterthought for final year students .<-->N
Students are expected to develop a reflective portfolio to assist their development and showcase evidence of their skills and capabilities to future employers .<-->N
They also gain accreditation from the Institute of Leadership and Management -LRB- ILM -RRB- .<-->N
The Keele curriculum is the first to be accredited by the ILM in this way .<-->N
It is still early days but , to date , we are pleased with the increasing numbers of students engaging with co-curricular and development strand activities .<-->O
Going to university is no longer seen as a rite of passage by this generation it should be a well-considered investment .<-->N
We regard our students not as customers but as learning partners , encouraging them to take control of their academic and personal development to shape their own future .<-->O
The term extracurricular seeks to remind us that learning takes place through a broad range of activities and experiences some in formal classroom settings and some in more informal settings , both within and outside of school .<-->N
Extracurricular activities should not be viewed as peripheral to high quality civic learning , but rather as indispensible to well rounded civic learning .<-->O
Extracurricular activities provide forums in which students can use skills and knowledge in purposeful experiences that have both meaning and context .<-->O
As one of the definitive studies on extracurricular activities notes , extracurriculars provide opportunities to acquire and practice skills that may be useful in a wide variety of settings -LSB- to -RSB- help students to develop a sense of agency as a member of one 's community ; to belong to a socially recognized and valued group , to develop support networks of peers and adults that can help in both present and future ; and to experience and deal with challenges .<-->O
-LRB- 98 -RRB- According to some studies , school group membership is an even better predictor of adult engagement than more commonly recognized factors such as education and income .<-->O
-LRB- 99 -RRB- A wide range of extracurricular activities have civic benefits .<-->N
Not surprisingly , explicitly civic activities such as mock trial , model congress , speech and debate , and model U.N. all have positive impacts on students ' civic knowledge and engagement .<-->O
There are civic benefits to a far broader set of extracurricular activities , however .<-->N
Reuben Thomas and Daniel McFarland found that participation in a wide range of extracurricular groups boosted students ' voting rates .<-->N
100 In their study , many activities that require teamwork and collaboration -LRB- such as the performing arts and some sports -RRB- were especially helpful for encouraging voting .<-->O
One study , based on their extensive review of the literature , concluded that there is good evidence that participating in extracurricular activities is associated with both short and long term indicators of positive development including school achievement and educational attainment .<-->O
-LRB- 101 -RRB- They go on to demonstrate that extracurricular programs are most effective if they provide opportunities to engage in challenging tasks that promote learning of valued skills ; provide opportunities to form strong social bonds with adults outside of the family and like minded peers ; and provide opportunities to develop and confirm positive personal identity .<-->O
-LRB- 102 -RRB- Finally , effective extracurricular programs must be both intensive and long term ;-LRB- 103 -RRB- research shows diminished effects absent sustained participation in high quality programming .<-->O
More specifically , research stresses the importance of three components of school based extracurricular activities that contribute positively to school attainment .<-->O
First , students should voluntarily select activities because of a genuine interest .<-->O
Second , activities should be structured , organized , scheduled regularly , and led by an adult .<-->N
Third , activities should require effort on the part of the student -LRB- 104 -RRB- Given that many existing extracurricular activities already meet these criteria , schools interested in promoting civic engagement through extracurricular activities often need only to strengthen their support for existing programs .<-->O
There are two primary threats to extracurricular programs and the civic benefits that come from them .<-->O
First , as funding for extracurricular programs is reduced , we should anticipate reductions in effectiveness with schools and other service providers unable to afford the full commitment that such programs require .<-->O
Second , the literature suggests that the positive impact of extracurricular and after school experiences may be undermined by policies that place low performing students in after school tutoring or focus on an experience that replicates or closely aligns with the traditional school program are less effective .<-->O
Given that the goal of civic learning on the whole is to prepare students for knowledgeable , engaged citizenship , extracurricular activities can serve as a vital bridge between classroom learning and the world at large .<-->O
Once students have the essential knowledge that comes from classroom instruction , extracurricular activities can show them how their newly acquired knowledge is relevant in broader contexts .<-->O
The relationship between citizen and society is essential , notes an American Bar Association report , and the goal of extracurricular activities should be to illustrate significant connections between students and larger communities , such as town , nation , and world .<-->O
-LRB- 105 -RRB- In focusing on this goal , extracurricular activities are a vital part of well rounded civic learning .<-->O
In Democracy and Education , John Dewey posits that the conception of education as a social process and function has no definite meaning until we define the kind of society we have in mind .<-->O
85 This process of moving society toward a particular ideal requires informed , thoughtful students who are engaged in their communities beyond the classroom .<-->O
They have the capacity to take action with the goal of impacting the public sphere .<-->N
They view the role of citizen as active , rather than passive , engaged rather than alienated , and contributing rather than accepting .<-->O
Service learning is an instructional methodology that makes intentional links between the academic curriculum and student work that benefits the community by providing meaningful opportunities for students to apply what they learn to issues that matter to them .<-->O
Service learning is far more than community service alone ; high quality service learning experiences incorporate intentional opportunities for students to analyze and solve community problems through the application of knowledge and skills .<-->O
Service learning helps to make education real , connecting academic skills and knowledge to issues that matter to young people .<-->O
When students have opportunities to use the knowledge and skills they are acquiring in school to address meaningful issues in their community , the content of their learning becomes more relevant to their lives , and they better understand the importance of civic participation .<-->O
Research makes clear the positive impact of service learning on both academic and civic outcomes .<-->O
Students who benefit from quality service learning experiences have been shown to have higher commitments to civic participation and make significantly greater gains in academic achievement than nonparticipating students .<-->O
Across a number of studies conducted on service learning programs , test scores on state assessments for students who participated in service learning have been demonstrated to be higher in reading , writing , mathematics , social studies , and science : !<-->O
Research shows that service learning , when done well , has a positive civic impact on students ' civic knowledge , skills , dispositions , and engagement .<-->O
-LRB- 86 -RRB- !<-->N
Middle and high schools students in Illinois who participated in service learning programs showed statistically significant gains in their academic engagement , academic competence , aspirations to pursue postsecondary education , acquisition of twenty first century skills , social emotional learning skills such as conflict management and self control , civic dispositions , and support for their schools .<-->O
They also gained work experience and specific skills in reading , writing , math , and science .<-->N
-LRB- 87 -RRB- !<-->N
Elementary school students in Michigan participating in service learning reported greater levels of behavioral , affective , and cognitive engagement in school than their nonparticipating peers , showing statistically significant differences in the effort they expended , paying attention , completing homework on time , and sharing what they learned with others .<-->O
Participating students also demonstrated significantly higher test scores on the state assessment than their nonparticipating peers in the areas of writing , social studies overall , and three social studies strands : historical perspective , geographic perspective , and inquiry / decision making .<-->O
-LRB- 88 -RRB- !<-->N
Middle and high school students from school districts in Ohio where teachers received funding to use service learning practices in their classrooms outscored their peers on a number of pre/post measures .<-->N
The 1,650 students in grades 6 12 who participated in service learning had significantly higher gains than their peers on measures of academic engagement , academic competence , school attachment , aspirations , environmental stewardship , and acquisition of twenty first century skills such as critical thinking , problem solving , and collaboration .<-->O
-LRB- 89 -RRB- Defining High Quality Service learning .<-->N
Beyond the centrality of service learning to developing civic skills and dispositions , as outlined above , event research has refined the definition of high quality service learning and showed the connections between service learning and other key educational outputs .<-->O
Historically , the quality of service learning practice has varied widely .<-->N
-LRB- 90 -RRB- Leaders in the service learning community recently released the National K 12 Service Learning Standards for Quality Practice , which defines what constitutes high quality service learning .<-->O
These standards make it possible to assess and document the impact of service learning programs , as well as provide states , school districts , and teachers with a better understanding of the indicators of effective practice .<-->O
Effective service learning programs share the following eight traits : 1 .<-->N
Have sufficient duration and intensity to address community needs and meet specified outcomes .<-->N
Are used intentionally as an instructional strategy to meet learning goals and/or content standards .<-->O
Incorporate multiple challenging reflection activities that are ongoing and that prompt deep thinking and analysis about oneself and one 's relationship to society .<-->O
Actively engage participants in meaningful and personally relevant service activities .<-->O
Promote understanding of diversity and mutual respect among all participants .<-->O
Are collaborative , and mutually beneficial and address community needs .<-->O
Engage participants in an ongoing process to assess the quality of implementation and progress toward meeting specified goals and use results for improvement and sustainability .<-->O
Provide youth with a strong voice in planning , implementing , and evaluating service learning experiences with guidance from adults .<-->O
-LRB- 91 -RRB- Service Learning , Academic Achievement , and the Achievement Gap .<-->N
Recent research shows that service learning has positive consequences for academic achievement .<-->O
A variety of studies have shown evidence of a range of achievement related benefits from service learning , including improved attendance , higher grade point averages , enhanced preparation for the workforce , enhanced awareness and understanding of social issues , greater motivation for learning , and heightened engagement in prosocial behaviors .<-->O
Research shows that students who participated in service learning activities in high school were 22 percentage points more likely to graduate from college than those who did not participate , and that civic engagement activities raised the odds of graduation and improved high school students ' progress in reading , math , science , and history .<-->O
-LRB- 92 -RRB- The National Research Council specifically suggests the use of service learning as an important engagement strategy for high school , implicitly recognizing that service learning incorporates many of the research based factors associated with student engagement in academic work , better preparing them for success in college and the workplace .<-->O
-LRB- 93 -RRB- Beyond these general benefits , service learning works for students in low income schools and communities .<-->O
Schools in high poverty areas are less likely to employ service learning as a teaching strategy .<-->O
Yet research has shown this is a particularly effective pedagogy for use in such schools .<-->O
In Philadelphia , for example , low income students in service learning classes gained more on standardized tests than their nonparticipating peers .<-->N
-LRB- 94 -RRB- Similar results occurred in Michigan and Texas when service learning was of high quality .<-->N
Service learning can significantly reduce the achievement gap between affluent and low income students .<-->O
Low income students who participated in service opportunities had better school attendance and grades than low income students who did not participate .<-->O
-LRB- 95 -RRB- Despite the effectiveness of these programs , schools in high poverty areas are less likely to engage their students in service learning experiences than their wealthier counterparts , a shortcoming that comes from inadequate teacher preparation , limited school resources , and narrowed curricula .<-->O
Implementing high quality service learning in disadvantaged communities will not only improve the civic health of those communities , but also help narrow both the academic achievement gap and the civic learning opportunity gap .<-->O
Service learning and Teacher Quality .<-->N
Service learning can significantly impact school reform efforts that seek to address teacher quality issues .<-->N
Research consistently identifies successful teachers as those who use instructional strategies that challenge students to use higher order thinking skills , scaffold knowledge , and provide learning experiences that help students learn to transfer knowledge to new situations .<-->O
-LRB- 96 -RRB- These conditions are all found in quality service learning experiences : Teachers who use service learning are significantly more likely to use high quality teaching strategies like cooperative learning , participate in projects integrating technology and requiring data collection , use primary resources , and make meaningful connections to the community , resulting in stronger impacts in a variety of academic and behavioral categories than those who do n't .<-->O
-LRB- 97 -RRB- Part of educating for democracy includes ensuring that students understand and value the importance of each individual making positive contributions to the well being of his or her community .<-->O
To achieve this ideal , opportunities to practice the skills and habits of citizenship should be incorporated throughout students ' educational experiences and service learning is an extremely effective strategy for doing so .<-->O
As a strategy implemented in a variety of subject areas and for students of all ages , service learning is not limited to a particular program and spans the boundaries of traditional history and civics courses .<-->O
Whether in science or history , mathematics or language arts , service learning can spark the civic imagination of students of all ages as they begin the lifelong habits of engaged learning and active citizenship .<-->O
Given opportunities to use the knowledge and skills they learn in school to address meaningful issues in the community , students gain an understanding of the importance and benefits of civic participation and how to effectively engage in our democracy .<-->O
Downloads Guardian of Democracy Click to Download PDF Document The term extracurricular seeks to remind us that learning takes place through a broad range of activities and experiences some in formal classroom settings and some in more informal settings , both within and outside of school .<-->N
Extracurricular activities should not be viewed as peripheral to high quality civic learning , but rather as indispensible to well rounded civic learning .<-->O
Extracurricular activities provide forums in which students can use skills and knowledge in purposeful experiences that have both meaning and context .<-->O
As one of the definitive studies on extracurricular activities notes , extracurriculars provide opportunities to acquire and practice skills that may be useful in a wide variety of settings -LSB- to -RSB- help students to develop a sense of agency as a member of one 's community ; to belong to a socially recognized and valued group , to develop support networks of peers and adults that can help in both present and future ; and to experience and deal with challenges .<-->O
-LRB- 98 -RRB- According to some studies , school group membership is an even better predictor of adult engagement than more commonly recognized factors such as education and income .<-->O
-LRB- 99 -RRB- A wide range of extracurricular activities have civic benefits .<-->N
Not surprisingly , explicitly civic activities such as mock trial , model congress , speech and debate , and model U.N. all have positive impacts on students ' civic knowledge and engagement .<-->O
There are civic benefits to a far broader set of extracurricular activities , however .<-->N
Reuben Thomas and Daniel McFarland found that participation in a wide range of extracurricular groups boosted students ' voting rates .<-->N
100 In their study , many activities that require teamwork and collaboration -LRB- such as the performing arts and some sports -RRB- were especially helpful for encouraging voting .<-->O
One study , based on their extensive review of the literature , concluded that there is good evidence that participating in extracurricular activities is associated with both short and long term indicators of positive development including school achievement and educational attainment .<-->O
-LRB- 101 -RRB- They go on to demonstrate that extracurricular programs are most effective if they provide opportunities to engage in challenging tasks that promote learning of valued skills ; provide opportunities to form strong social bonds with adults outside of the family and like minded peers ; and provide opportunities to develop and confirm positive personal identity .<-->O
-LRB- 102 -RRB- Finally , effective extracurricular programs must be both intensive and long term ;-LRB- 103 -RRB- research shows diminished effects absent sustained participation in high quality programming .<-->O
More specifically , research stresses the importance of three components of school based extracurricular activities that contribute positively to school attainment .<-->O
First , students should voluntarily select activities because of a genuine interest .<-->O
Second , activities should be structured , organized , scheduled regularly , and led by an adult .<-->N
Third , activities should require effort on the part of the student -LRB- 104 -RRB- Given that many existing extracurricular activities already meet these criteria , schools interested in promoting civic engagement through extracurricular activities often need only to strengthen their support for existing programs .<-->O
There are two primary threats to extracurricular programs and the civic benefits that come from them .<-->O
First , as funding for extracurricular programs is reduced , we should anticipate reductions in effectiveness with schools and other service providers unable to afford the full commitment that such programs require .<-->O

Downloads Guardian of Democracy Click to Download PDF Document One of the ways in which schools can prepare students for a lifetime of democratic participation is to train them in self government within the school context .<-->N
Students often have good ideas about how to improve their schools and communities as places for civic life and learning , and formal structures for considering students ' views are a valuable way of modeling democratic practices and teaching students civic skills .<-->O
Perhaps the most common form of student participation in school governance , student councils , are laboratories for practical experiences in civics and the principles of democracy .<-->N
Student councils should be far more than the social planners of the school ; they should instead stimulate and engage large numbers of students in school and community service activities and provide a forum for student voice on questions that impact the students themselves .<-->O
In addition to civic skills and dispositions , student councils and other forums for students to participate in school government should self consciously promote a wide range of skills and dispositions including twenty first century skills , financial literacy , and environmental literacy .<-->N
Research from the National Association of Student Councils notes that student participation in school governance should meet several basic tenets : Activities must be structured , students must make a substantial time commitment to activities , activities must engage student interest , and students ' decisions must have real effects .<-->O
These parameters leave room for a wide range of student governance programs , but all successful programs will provide students with civic skills and dispositions that , once students graduate , will be transferrable to our democracy at large .<-->O
Beyond conventional student government -LRB- involving a few elected representatives -RRB- , programs should facilitate schoolwide democratic deliberation as a way of fostering civic skills and dispositions among all students .<-->O
A wide variety of programs , such as those that divide students into clusters to participate in democratic deliberation and community projects , have been shown to have positive implications on students ' civic health .<-->O
Participation in school governance has benefits for the students directly involved such as those elected to a council and also for their fellow students .<-->N
Those who directly participate show better academic success and higher likelihood of civic participation later on , including voting .<-->O
-LRB- 106 -RRB- Data from the National Education Longitudinal Study demonstrates that participants in student governance have higher test scores and are more likely to volunteer and participate in campaigns and other political activities .<-->N
-LRB- 107 -RRB- Meanwhile , as noted above -LRB- see Benefit of Civic Learning : Improving School Climate , page 24 -RRB- , students who attend schools where they feel student voice is honored are more likely to be trusting and civically engaged later .<-->O
Student participation in school governance provides students with civic skills that will serve them well beyond their time in school .<-->N
Students who know how to make their voice heard at school will be best equipped to be active and effective in their communities at large Downloads Guardian of Democracy Click to Download PDF Document In addition to the above practices , young people can also practice citizenship by playing roles in simulations .<-->O
Games and other simulations contribute to civic learning by allowing young people to act in fictional environments in ways that would be impossible for them in the real world ; for example , they can play the role of president of the United States or an ambassador to the United Nations .<-->O
Games and simulations can be constructed so as to be highly engaging and motivating while also requiring advanced academic skills and constructive interaction with other students under challenging circumstances Simulations are not new , and traditional examples include mock trial and model congress programs that continue to be popular and effective among many high school students .<-->O
In addition to the obvious benefit of increased civic knowledge -LRB- about judicial and legislative processes , respectively , as well as more particular content -RRB- , students learn skills with clear applicability to both civic and noncivic contexts , such as public speaking , teamwork , close reading , analytical thinking , and the ability to argue both sides of a topic .<-->O
All of these are skills that prepare students both for active citizenship and for future academic and career success .<-->N
Simulations that contribute to civic learning are applicable widely in the curriculum .<-->N
In a history class , for example , a model constitutional convention or a mock trial based on a historically significant Supreme Court case teaches students both historical content and civic skills .<-->O
In a multiplayer game called Urban Science , students play the role of city planners in their actual city .<-->N
An evaluation of that program found substantial gains in knowledge , skills , and values relevant to civic engagement .<-->O
-LRB- 108 -RRB- Simulations of democratic processes in the classroom enrich civics courses -LRB- as well as other courses -RRB- and ensure that the maximum number of students reap the benefits of those simulations .<-->O
Simulations as extracurricular activities , such as a competitive debate team or a model congress after school program , reach fewer students but provide the opportunity for a greater time investment and deeper learning .<-->O
In addition to the many effective types of simulations that have existed for decades , technology can also be a powerful tool for teaching students about democratic processes .<-->O
In the epistemic games developed by David Williamson Shaffer and colleagues , computers are used to model the work environments of professionals .<-->N
Students write emails , organize meetings , and do other adult tasks in pursuit of civic goals .<-->F
-LRB- 109 -RRB- In ICONS , students from several countries negotiate international issues .<-->N
-LRB- 110 -RRB- iCivics , an organization founded by Justice O'Connor , provides a whole suite of games for civic learning as well as curriculum and professional development for teachers .<-->N
Some of the most recent simulations bridge the virtual and real worlds by requiring players to complete missions offline .<-->O
Examples include Nuvana 's game Interrobang , in which students complete service missions , and Legislative Aide from Community Knowledge Base , in which students play aides to a fictional congresswoman in their real district and conduct real field research .<-->O
-LRB- 111 -RRB- New research suggests that game narratives are beneficial to students in their ability to provide motivation and real time feedback .<-->O
-LRB- 112 -RRB- Games and simulations teach both civic skills and skills that are broadly applicable .<-->N
As school and district leaders look to provide their students with well rounded civic learning , simulations of democratic processes are powerful tools .<-->O
CHAPTER I EXTBA-CTJBBICTJLAB ACTIVITIES History of the Movement .<-->N
Extra-curricular ac - tivities are those legitimate activities not pro- vided for in that part of the school program which is usually designated as the curriculum .<-->F
They are sometimes referred to as semi-cur ric - ular or intra-curricular activities .<-->N
They have gained recognition among educa - tors as a vital part of every high school pro- gram intended to train our boys and girls to take their places in the democracy of the world .<-->O
Their place in that program is the result of a changed viewpoint as to what the aim of the school should be .<-->N
There was a time not far distant when the entire aim of the school was to develop the intellect to its highest powers , regardless of the social or even the physical needs of the individual .<-->O
There might have been some justification for this situation in the fact that the population of our country was so scattered during the early years of public school growth that many of the social attrac - 1 2 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES tions of our time wore - unknown .<-->O
Secondary schools were attended only by the select few who were preparing to enter the learned pro- fessions .<-->N
As in practically every field of human activity , social changes incident to the coming of the industrial era wrought their transforma - tions in the classroom .<-->N
The greater opportunity of the period extended the select group until it contained the sons and daughters of thousands lifted to a new plane of well-being in the day of organization , cooperation , and combination in business .<-->O
The physical needs of the children were once cared for by the work of the farm and the essentially outdoor life of a rural and pioneer country .<-->N
Cities grew , however , and artificial means of Insuring health and vigor took the place of natural advantages .<-->O
All of these evolutionary changes in society were vastly speeded up by the great World War , And with the war came a realization , as never before , of the great importance of education in a democracy .<-->O
It was brought forcibly to the attention of the world as the light of hope to which civilization must look if hard-earned ad - vances in democracy are to endure .<-->O
The American high school appeared as the outstanding agent of this new and vital educa - EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 3 tion .<-->O
Its growth was phenomenal .<-->N
In the short span of thirty years its enrollment increased five - fold , with the American people building new high school buildings at the rate of one a day every day in the thirty years .<-->N
Since 1890 the high school enrollment has increased 710 per cent ; the popu - lation , 68 per cent .<-->N
The number of high school graduates jumped from 22,000 in 1890 to 250,000 in 1924 .<-->N
At the present time there are approxi - mately 2,000,000 students in the secondary schools of the United States .<-->N
With this phenomenal growth came a broaden - ing of purpose , a more varied curriculum , a more cosmopolitan body of students , and a mani - fest tendency on the part of the students to imitate the life of the community in which they found themselves .<-->N
One of the marked expres - sions of the new spirit was the coming of athletics into prominence .<-->N
These changes brought school people every - where slowly but surely to a realization of the social needs of our high school program .<-->O
Underlying Principles .<-->N
It is well to keep in mind in connection with a discussion of this subject some of the underlying principles of thought which have influenced the development of the extra-curricular program .<-->O
The first of these principles is a recognition of individual differ - 4 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ences in children and of the need of a program to meet their needs .<-->O
Children differ in ability , aptitude , sex , probable career -LRB- educational and vocational -RRB- , social status , environment , tradi - tions , habits of work , race , nationality , age , health , intellectual development , economic status , moral atmosphere , and in numerous other ways such as to make it imperative that our secondary schools provide not only a differentiated curricu - lum , departmentalization , homogeneous group - ing , promotion by subject , and vocational and educational guidance ; but also such forms of extra-curricular activities as may utilize the social instinct and the socializing , integrating factors important in establishing a common basis of feelings , aspirations , and ideals essential in a democracy , A second underlying principle is found in that simple statement of fact which is almost axio - matic , namely , the best preparation for life is living , and the best training for citizenship in a democracy is citizenship in a democracy .<-->O
If this be true , both curricular and extra-curricular activities should be such that they approach and possibly reach life situations .<-->O
The school ought to be organized as a social community working on a body of facts as a basis for social actioB , training the members in desirable attitudes and EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 5 dispositions .<-->O
All of its resources should be utilized to realize the social mission of education .<-->N
The school can not be a preparation for social life unless it reproduces within itself the condi - tions of social life .<-->N
Education progressing in a school organized as a social laboratory is not merely a preparation for citizenship ; it is train , - , ing in citizenship .<-->N
Equalization of ^ opportunity , a democratic ideal , is the third underlying principle .<-->O
Dr. Briggs tells us that `` the one place where democratic ideals and objectives may function in a natural matrix is in the conduct of the extra-curricular activities .<-->N
Whether a student is notably dull , studious , clever , rich , poor , handsome , or ugly he should have an equal opportunity to be a member of a school organization which ought under all circumstances to be organized upon a basis of democratic society . ''<-->O
A fourth underlying principle recognizes that extra-curricular activities are educative only when they develop qualities that make for a com - plete citizenship , notably leadership , initiative , cooperation and intelligent obedience to author - ity .<-->O
A broad program of extra-curricular activi - ties affords a splendid opportunity to develop a diversified and balanced leadership , as well as these other qualities .<-->O
Every good citizen pos - 6 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES sesses them to some degree , and it is of primary importance that all educational agencies enable students to practice them with satisfaction .<-->O
It may be done through the content of the curricu - lum , the method of teaching , and especially by the participation of the student in the extra - curricular life of the school .<-->O
Instead of frowning , as in older days , upon the desire of the young to act upon their own initia - tive , we have learned that only upon these varied interests can be laid the surest basis for healthy growth .<-->O
Self-reliance , honesty , perseverance , and respect for the rights of others are needed .<-->O
The school democracy must be animated by the spirit of cooperation , the spirit of freely work - ing together for the positive good of the whole .<-->O
Initiative is encouraged in order that better contributions may be made to the common task .<-->N
Students will be trained to give intelligent obedi - ence to authority when they learn from experi - ence that their best interest is sought by the law of the school , and when their social con - sciousness is enlisted to help frame and enforce the regulations under which they are to live .<-->O
In a democracy rules must be obeyed , but the rules are not decreed by an autocrat ; they are willed by the group itself , Eesponsibility for success or failure in the execution of orders rests not EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 7 only with those who obey , but also with those who help to make them .<-->O
The fifth underlying principle is the one given by Dr. Briggs in his work The Junior High School : It is the business of the teacher to teach the pupil to do better the desirable things he will do anyway ; to reveal higher types of activity ; to make these desired and to an extent possible .<-->O
These simply stated principles are far reach - ing in their effects .<-->N
Their acceptance obliges one to make an inventory of the desirable ac - tivities pursued by boys and girls in school , with reference to the characters they are most likely to develop as men and women .<-->O
These activities apply to the entire secondary school program , both curricular and extra-curricular .<-->N
Extra-curricular activities are found to offer the school its best opportunity to help students do certain desirable things they are going to do anyway as they take their places as members of social units , and to exercise those qualities of citizenship which are fundamental to society .<-->O
In these activities , too , there is a ready channel through which the school may utilize the spon - taneous interests and activities of the adolescent , and through these lead to higher types of activi - ties both desired and possible of attainment .<-->O
8 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES In the sixth underlying principle there is almost general agreement .<-->N
Extra-curricular ac - tivities should have their foundations , in most instances , in the curricular activities and should help to motivate them .<-->O
In a recent report to the National Education Association , a sub - committee of which the writer was a member laid emphasis on this principle .<-->N
In addition , the committee reported as follows : The final objective of the Junior High School program of studies must be to provide socialization on a scale so extensive that adolescent youth may find in the school it - self the special field for their activities as -LSB- junior -RSB- citi - zens .<-->O
It is vital to recognize that the organized activities of school socialization should be and are motivated by ac - cepted educational objectives to an extent equal to the motivation of the subjects of study by such objectives .<-->O
When this recognition is once given , school activities will be dignified by a place in the program of studies and by a definite time allotment consistent with their rich educa - tional possibilities .<-->O
They must be as definitely planned as any other administrative or instructional facilities for the attainment of the objectives of secondary education .<-->N
They should become integral parts of the program of studies .<-->N
They deserve a higher recognition than that accorded by the designation extra-curricular .<-->N
They are intra-curricu - lar activities .<-->N
The seventh underlying principle , that extra - curricular activities have a distinct moral value , is suggested in The Journal of the National Education Association for 1922 : EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 9 Our standards are not something remote from experi - ence but are engendered by experience itself .<-->O
Moral training can not be inculcated by giving cMldren a set of maxims ; it must be gained by the give and take of social life itself .<-->N
To provide a child with a set of maxims is to bind him an unthinking slave to the past ; to give him the power to realize the moral implications of his own conduct and to evolve a code of ethics for evaluating social experience , from the experience in which he is himself en - gaging , is to make him an active agent of civilization .<-->O
It is for this reason that activities in school are a funda - mental necessity in guiding conduct .<-->N
They give oppor - tunity for situations that bring about moral training through experience itself .<-->N
A school regime that encourages the passive absorption of knowledge for its own sake , that isolates pupils into individual units and emphasizes com - petition , that makes communication among pupils a sin , is training its pupils in a code of ethics which is not in accordance with what is advocated in life outside of school , and it fails to take advantage of the two great oppor - tunities for moral training of life in a social group the training in cooperation and social sympathy .<-->O
The experience of a pupil in the company of his fellows is the best moral training he can have .<-->O
Social disapproval has a quick and direct way of reforming conduct that is worth a dozen homilies or moral lessons .<-->O
Moral character is developed through formation of habits , through ex - perience .<-->N
Moral preference is exercised only in making a choice .<-->N
It is only when there is a freedom id act , to act wrongly or rightly , that any moral issue is involved .<-->O
Other - wise the intelligence has no opportunity to discern right from wrong ; the disposition to do right has no chance to function positively .<-->O
We can not develop in children a sense of responsibility to act rightly when we deny them free - dom of choice as to their actions .<-->O
10 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES In Bulletin No. 51 -LRB- 1917 -RRB- `` Moral Values in Education , '' published by the Bureau of Educa - tion , we have the following statement which sums up the whole argument for activities as moral agencies : First in importance as a moral agency should be placed the actual performance of the pupils themselves .<-->O
It is one thing to hear right conduct praised or see it exem - plified ; it is quite another and more necessary thing for the boys and girls themselves to do the acts .<-->O
Character is essentially a matter of action , the habitual performance of certain kinds of deeds rather than others ; and the only genuine way of learning how to do these deeds is to do them , just as tennis is learned only by play - ing it .<-->O
The better schools of our time have seized upon the fact that pupils take to activity so much more readily than they do to the relatively passive business of listen - ing or reading .<-->O
They are eager to engage in athletics , to run a school paper , to dance , to act plays , to build , to do dozens of things that merely sitting at a desk studying and reciting will never permit .<-->O
Other underlying principles briefly stated are as follows : Where the pupils are free to organ - ize and carry on their own activities , everything is done under the urge of strong motives .<-->O
By means of common interests , group experiences , and unified feeling , both individual development and democratic aims may be achieved , The organization of the secondary school must pro- EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 11 vide its adolescents with so much good to be done that the bad will have no place .<-->O
Extra-curricular activities must be suited to the age of the students .<-->N
Many of the activities that are well suited to the students of the early adolescent years will not appeal to them later on .<-->O
Opportunities must be provided for conscious choice , in accordance with intensive interest .<-->O
CHAPTER II ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION OF EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES Extra-curricular Director or Teacher .<-->N
The suc - cess of the extra-curricular program depends largely upon the wisdom , foresight , sympathy , and enthusiasm of the principal and those dele - gated by him to carry it out .<-->O
High school prin - cipals , except in very small schools , need the assistance of at least one faculty member in carrying out an extra-curricular program as outlined in this book .<-->O
In the city of Pittsburgh , each junior , junior-senior , and senior high school is assigned an extra teacher designated by the title `` Extra-curricular Teacher . ''<-->N
She may be assigned to full-time supervision of the extra-curricular work , or the time allotted to this extra teacher may be so dis - tributed that several teachers may have free time for this purpose .<-->N
Under this plan sev - eral activities may receive the attention of one teacher for one half of every day : cltib activities , school assemblies , social programs .<-->N
12 DMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 13 Another teacher devotes one half of her time to student government in all its phases .<-->N
In another high school this time is divided among four faculty members .<-->N
Teachers or administrators who have charge of this work should be selected with great care .<-->O
They need to have a clear-cut conception of the place of extra-curricular activities in a modern school program .<-->O
The importance of the position is such that one to occupy it should possess tact , ability , vision , engaging personality , and en - thusiasm .<-->O
Every high school ought to have an activities committee appointed by the principal to handle all problems connected with the activi - ties of the school .<-->O
The recommendations of this committee should be subject to the principal 's approval .<-->O
Activities Period .<-->N
The extra-curricular pro- gram is so important that a regular period each > day should be set aside to promote it .<-->O
Such a period is usually designated the `` activities period . ' ?<-->N
It always results in a much better spirit of cooperation on the part of both pupils and teachers .<-->O
It gives dignity and recognition to the extra-curricular program in a manner impos - sible when this work is attempted after school hours .<-->N
Moreover , it prevents the program from interf eriag with the after-school plans of parents , 14 EXTRA-CURRICULAR , ACTIVITIES employers , and others , leaving free the time which should be used for athletic events or various features which might more profitably take place after regular school hours .<-->O
Teachers are more likely to be interested if this plan is followed , and it encourages them to volunteer sponsorship relations .<-->O
The activities period must be a real activities period , with a rich extra-curricular program , or it develops into a mere loafing period .<-->O
The following program is carried out in the activities periods of a week in the high schools of Pitts - burgh and is suggestive of what may be done in this field : Monday Student Council Conference and Guidance Day Tuesday Home-Room Class Meeting Wednesday Club Meetings Thursday Junior Assembly and Clubs Friday Senior Assembly and Clubs Such a program furnishes the opportunity for a very rich extra-curricular life .<-->O
The conference and guidance period permits the home-room or report-class teacher to come into intimate con - tact with the individual members of her report class .<-->O
It affords her an opportunity for check - ing their scholarship , attendance , and interests , especially valuable in following through a good ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 15 guidance program .<-->O
This guidance program is accomplished through regular guidance instruc - tion and the organization of Life Career Clubs , especially for students in the junior high school grades .<-->O
Life Career Clubs , where organized , have been conducted as a part of the guidance program of the school and have been unusually successful .<-->O
Instructional material for them has been care - fully worked out and forms the basis for real work for these Monday activities periods .<-->O
1 Home-Room Meetings .<-->N
The home-room meet - ing is held each Tuesday during the activities period .<-->N
The meeting is the heart of the entire program , for it reaches all students in the school .<-->N
It is the time when every vital question dealing with the welfare of the institution is democrati - cally discussed .<-->N
The home-room representative on the student council brings back for discussion the recommendations of that organization , fol - lowed by rejection or adoption .<-->O
The home-room organization can initiate school policies and rec - ommendations which may be sent through repre - sentatives to the student council for consideration by that body .<-->N
There is an almost inexhaustible supply of topics affording profitable discussion by the students in the home-room period .<-->N

The home room is organized with its own officers .<-->N
These students preside at all meetings .<-->N
The teacher , although in the background , func - tions as the guiding spirit and inspiration of the group .<-->O
Parliamentary procedure should be used invariably in order that the students may have that practice and experience likely to prove in - valuable later on in life .<-->O
Club Activities .<-->N
The Wednesday activities pe - riod is set aside for the meetings of the numer - ous clubs .<-->N
The ultimate ideal of each school should be the enlistment of its entire enrollment from conscious choice , based on interest in some club activity of the school .<-->O
The difficulty of doing this must not be underestimated .<-->O
Club motives , club sponsorship , and club organiza - tion are problems not always simple of solution .<-->N
But the ideal of every student in a worth-while club is an ideal which is worthy and which is possible of attainment .<-->O
It has already been accomplished in some junior high schools In America .<-->N

Commercial Club Sponsorship .<-->N
Each club should be sponsored properly by a member of the faculty .<-->N
Sponsors should be appointed by the principal , who should take into account their qualifications for the assignment .<-->N
It is not good policy for the prin - cipal to appoint sponsors indiscriminately .<-->N
As a rule , teachers who volunteer for sponsorship of clubs are more likely to be successful .<-->N
Stu - dents frequently make good suggestions for sponsors of dubs , but it is not always safe to follow their suggestions .<-->O
Popular teachers do not always make good sponsors .<-->N
Teachers are rapidly dispelling the old-time idea that they should confine their interests to mathematics , science , English , or whatever hap - pens to be their field .<-->O
They are finding out that their sphere of influence is not confined to the four walls of their individual classrooms .<-->N
22 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES The writer was gratified beyond measure in developing an extra-curricular program through four years of experience as a high school prin - cipal to find how gladly teachers would volunteer their services for these activities as soon as they actually caught the vision of the enlarged oppor - tunity thus opened to the boys and girls .<-->O
The sponsors should , of course , attend all club meet - ings and hold themselves constantly in readi - ness to serve .<-->N
Provision must be made for wise guidance .<-->O
Students ought not to be permitted to enter upon any activity unless they display an evident enthusiasm for the activity and an interest in the organization .<-->O
There should be for admission to any club .<-->N
The educational guidance program falls short of its purpose unless it leads students into activities suited to their tastes , interests , and needs .<-->O
It should be a stimulating influence to the pupil who appears to lack interest in school activities .<-->O
Bound pegs in round holes are necessary if any activity is to succeed .<-->N
Club Membership Requirements .<-->N
Every club should have its own constitution and by-laws .<-->N
Eequirements for admission are determined by the purpose of the club and the nature of its ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 23 work .<-->N
Under no circumstances should members be admitted to a club by a vote of the students through a process of blackballing or balloting .<-->N
In such organizations as orchestras , glee clubs , dramatic organizations , and debating clubs it is necessary to admit members through a try-out process .<-->O
After the students have become mem - bers of clubs , they should be checked to deter - mine whether or not they are being useful to the organization .<-->O
If they have no interest and fail to meet the requirements of the club , they should be dropped from membership .<-->O
How Organized .<-->N
Clubs are organized upon the request of students or upon the suggestion of a teacher who volunteers sponsorship .<-->N
The objectives of the club should be clearly stated , and it should be evident that they spring from a real , live interest on the part of those asking for the organization .<-->O
Experience has shown that some of the best high school clubs ever organized came about as the result of requests on the part of the students themselves .<-->N
Before clubs are accepted as a part of the approved activity program , they should be considered carefully by the extra-curricular directors , the faculty committee , and the principal .<-->N
Before and after the organization , the principal or his assistant should keep in close touch with these 24 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES club organizations in order that he may be sure they have worthy objectives , conform to school policy , and do not duplicate efforts of a similar nature elsewhere in the schooL With this in - formation , the principal may diplomatically dis - courage undesirable activities and point the way to better ones .<-->O
General Principles .<-->N
Students should be aided in keeping a proper balance between their extra - curricular activities and their curricular activi - ties .<-->N
The number of clubs to which they are permitted to belong ought to be limited .<-->N
In Pittsburgh high schools , two extra-curricular activities only are allowed .<-->N
That students who sever their relationship with the school should be automatically dropped from membership in all regular school activities is understood .<-->O
All money handled by extra-curricular organ - izations should pass through a centralized treasury or a centralized auditing and account - ing committee .<-->N
Business-like methods only should be considered .<-->N
The following plan in use in one high school is simple and meets the re - quirements of good business sense : All money from the high school organizations is deposited with the school treasurer -LRB- in this case a member of the commercial department of the faculty -RRB- as soon as it is acquired by any ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 25 class , club , organization treasurer , or financial agent .<-->O
The treasurer pays all bills incurred by these organizations when ordered on signature of the president and sponsor .<-->N
Day by day he deposits his receipts in a local bank The school treasurer keeps the funds of each organization in a separate account and can give information in a moment 's time with regard to the balance any organization may have in its treasury .<-->N
There is no overlapping of funds , no misappropriation .<-->N
The funds of each organiza - tion may be expended only by order of and in the interests of that organization .<-->N
For example , funds held for the athletic association are never devoted to any other interest , such as the library or school paper , unless such diversion of money is distinctly authorized .<-->O
The treasurer submits a complete report to the principal at the close of each semester , in addition to a report rendered by the auditing committee on the condition of the books * The treasurer is an officer under bond .<-->N
In view of the fact that sums ranging in amount from a few cents to more than ten thousand dollars pass through the treasurer 's hands , the necessity for a business-like system is perfectly obvious .<-->O
The School Assembly .<-->N
One activities period each week is devoted to the school assembly .<-->N
In some 26 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES - schools two periods a week are used for this purpose .<-->N
When the student body is divided for purposes of assembly , the group not partici - pating therein is afforded another chance for club activities or other student endeavors .<-->N
A more detailed discussion of the assembly will be given in a later chapter .<-->N
CHAPTER III DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS In this chapter a number of clubs are de - scribed in detail as examples of the possibilities in the field of extra-curricular activities .<-->N
There are , of course , other clubs equally worthy of a place in the program .<-->N
The ones mentioned are all functioning in high schools at the present time .<-->N
The Senior History Club .<-->N
The Senior History Club takes charge of all special day programs in the senior assembly .<-->F
This club functions more widely than any other organized club in the school .<-->F

This club is open to senior high school boys only .<-->N
Its membership com - prises the teams or squads in the current athletic sports participated in by the senior boys of the school .<-->N
In the fall it is the football squad , in the winter the basket-ball and gymnastic teams , and in the spring the baseball and track 30 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES teams .<-->F
There are usually about forty-five boys in the club .<-->N
It is sponsored by the senior coach who gives the members talks on games , sport , and sportmanship ; gives blackboard drills ; analyzes the games just played and points for - ward to the games yet to be played ; gives talks on clean living ; and brings in prominent athletes from local colleges and universities to talk to the boys on all phases of the sport which is their interest .<-->O
In Pittsburgh some of the speakers have been members of the University of Pitts - burgh football team , the sporting editor of one of the papers , Honus Wagner , famous baseball player , and Dr. Homer Flint , basket-ball specialist .<-->N
High ideals of sportsmanship are always stressed in the meetings of the Athletic Club .<-->N
The Puzzle Club .<-->F
This club is open to any in - terested student .<-->N
The `` puzzle instinct 7 ' is very strong in many young people .<-->O
They derive much pleasure and much good from puzzle solving .<-->O
The aim of the club is in direct line with the `` worthy use of leisure . '<-->N
7 The history or stories of the world 's most celebrated puzzles are re - lated in its meetings , and the time is devoted to the solution of puzzles brought in by the club members or gleaned from the pages of magazines and newspapers .<-->O
If the puzzles are not solved DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 31 in the meeting periods , they are taken home , worked out , and reported on by the members . .<-->N
On account of the current interest in cross-word puzzles , they have been added .<-->F
Contests are a feature of the work of this club .<-->N
Its purpose is wholesome mental recreation .<-->N
That there was a genuine interest in its activities was shown by the fact that during the past year seventy-six students in a certain school placed this club as their first choice of the school activities .<-->O
The Puzzle Club is included in the chapter to illus - trate the fact that there is a place in the well - rounded extra-curricular program not only for educational clubs , but also for recreational clubs .<-->O
The Travel Club .<-->N
This club is open to junior high school students , and serves as a supplement to the regular geography classes .<-->N
Imaginary trips by land and water are taken during the meetings , with frequent use of the stereoptican and motion-picture machine , as well as of pictures brought in by the students .<-->N
The students tell about their own trips .<-->N
The field of activity for such a club Is wide , as wide as the earth itself , and par - ticipation may be made very profitable to the younger students of the junior high school group .<-->O
The `` Travelers Club 7 ' of one high school has out - lined a trip around the world for its year 's work .<-->N
32 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES With Pittsburgh as a starting point , the club members have already reached Chicago , Yellow - stone Park , the Canadian Bockies , and the Pacific Northwest .<-->N
Thence the route calls for a visit to Alaska .<-->F
This traveling is done by means of slides , motion pictures , and photographs .<-->F
Each week seven or eight members are assigned topics dealing with the place to be visited .<-->F
These reports are then read and discussed in class .<-->N
The club is extremely popular .<-->N
The National Honor Society .<-->N
The National Hon - or Society of Secondary Schools is a national society with local chapters in the senior high schools of the country .<-->N
Its purpose , according to its constitution , is `` to create an enthusiasm for scholarship , to stimulate a desire to render service , to promote leadership , and to develop character in the students of the American secondary schools .<-->O
77 The general control of the organization is vested in a National Council .<-->N

An appropri - ate emblem , uniform throughout the country , is used by each chapter .<-->N
Besides possessing quali - ties of scholarship , service , leadership , and char - acter , a candidate for membership must rank DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 33 in the upper fourth of his class , and must have been a member of the school for at least one year .<-->O
Selection of members is made by the faculty or by the principal with the aid of a committee of faculty members .<-->N
There should be a place for this organization or its parallel in every senior high school .<-->N
1 The Health Club .<-->N
The Health Club , sponsored by two physical training teachers , one man and one woman , meets in the regular activities period .<-->F
Its membership is composed of the associate representatives of each report room .<-->N

The Hi-Y '' Club .<-->F
The `` Hi-Y '' Club is a func - tioning organization in many American junior and senior high , schools , backed by the Young Men 's Christian Association .<-->N
In Pennsylvania it has become a state-wide activity , and annual conferences of large subdivisions of the state are held in various cities , with the local clubs send - ing delegations to these meetings .<-->N
The `` Hi-Y y 9 38 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES Club is an organization formed to promote the ideals of the Young 's Men 's Christian Associa - tion among the boys of high school age .<-->N
Its mem - bership is open to every boy who displays an interest in its purpose .<-->N
As expressed in most of the declarations of purpose of `` Hi-Y '' Clubs in Pennsylvania , the aims of the movement are primarily to introduce and maintain ideals of clean speech , clean sports - manship , clean scholarship , and clean living in the high school .<-->O
This purpose is accomplished through an active program mapped out to cover the school year .<-->N
Weekly meetings are held , usually at the supper hour , the boys gathering after school for social recreation until 5 : 30 or 6 o'clock , and then taking dinner together , usually in the Young Men 's Christian Associa - tion .<-->N
In most cases , this dinner is served at a very low rate , in the hope that no boys need feel any necessity for remaining outside the club on account of the cost .<-->O
Following the dinner , the club , under the direction of its president , enjoys a number of songs or cheers for a few minutes .<-->N
This part of the program bears a distinct flavor of `` school spirit . ''<-->N
In fact , it is one of the aims of the organization to develop the right kind of `` school spirit , 7 ' diffusing a wholesome en - thusiasm throughout the entire student body .<-->O
DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 39 After the songs , an outside speaker who knows how to talk to boys , be he business man , `` Y '' leader , college athlete , or preacher , is allowed fifteen or twenty minutes for the talk of the evening .<-->N
Following this address , the boys ad - journ .<-->F
Numerous Bible Study classes are organized , and the students are urged to take part in these groups , which meet after the regu - lar program .<-->N
The entire meeting is closed in ample time for the boys to return to their homes before the evening is far advanced .<-->O
The motives of the `` Ei-Y '' Club are well illustrated by the following ^ `` Declaration of Purpose '' : As a `` Hi-Y '' Club member , I declare it to be my purpose : 1 .<-->N
To be faithful in attendance at club meetings .<-->N
To uphold the four planks of the `` Hi-Y '' platform : Clean Speech , Clean Sportsmanship , Clean Scholarship , Clean Living .<-->N
To carry the Torch of Service wherever I go .<-->F
In all ways and at all times to seek by my inward life and outward conduct and through cooperative efforts with others to create , maintain , and extend high stand - ards of Christian character throughout the high school and the community in which I live .<-->O
\ The application for membership in a certain high school `` Hi-Y '' Club states its purpose as follows : 40 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES I hereby declare that if accepted as a member , I will be faithful in attendance at the club meetings and will seek by my inward life and outward conduct -LRB- and through cooperative efforts with others -RRB- to create , main - tain , and extend high standards of Christian character throughout our high school and the community in ` which I live .<-->O
Each year the `` Hi-Y '' Club is instrumental in conducting a `` MuF '' week in the high school or junior high school .<-->O
This week is dedicated to `` MuF , '' or , `` Move Up Forward . ''<-->N
Its aim is to give each boy in the school who will signify his willingness to cooperate a fifteen-minute -LRB- or longer -RRB- conference with some local business man of recognized standing , on any problem , moral or social , which the boy would like to discuss con - fidentially with such a person .<-->O
The interview is designed to help the boy to determine his own duties , obligations , and conduct .<-->N
Men are chosen for the interviews who may be depended upon to say something during the interview which will help the boy in some department of his own life .<-->N
The `` MuF '' program has been successful in reaching hundreds of boys in every high school in which it has been tried .<-->N
The students are `` signed up '' for conferences largely through the efforts of the members of the `` Hi-Y '' Club .<-->N
It is probably the one outstanding contribution of the club to the school each year .<-->N

** The Place and Significance of Extra-curricular Activities in the Junior High School , '' Official Report , De - partment of Superintendence , February 25 to March 1 , 1923 .<-->F
CHAPTER IV STUDENT PABTICIPATION IN HIGH SCHOOL CONTROL This part of the extra-curricular program lias been variously referred to as '' Student Self - Government , '' the `` Junior Civic League , '' `` Student Welfare League , '' '' School Service Club , '' `` School Senate , '' etc. .<-->N
None of these terms fully describe the idea behind this part of the - extra-curricular program .<-->N
`` Student Self - Go vernment Organization '' as a name has never been satisfactory .<-->N
The term applied in the heading of this chapter seems most nearly to fit the idea schools are seeking to put into prac - tice at the present time .<-->O
Underlying Principles .<-->N
The following educa - tional principles have been more or less gen - erally accepted and are particularly apropos in connection with a discussion of this subject : 1 .<-->N
Man learns to do by doing .<-->N
Education comes from within .<-->F
The period of adolescence is particularly 60 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES favorable to the development of self-gov - ernment because of the prominence of the characteristics of gregariousness , altruism , and restiveness under restraint .<-->O
Since the nature of man is fundamentally social , his highest development can only be obtained through cooperative activities .<-->O
To train for democracy , the school must be a democracy .<-->N
Just as children learn to write by writing and learn to read by reading , so they learn the prin - ciples of government by assuming responsibility and actually practicing citizenship in coopera - tive activities within the school .<-->O
One of the richest veins in all education has been tapped in recent years by the recognition of these prin - ciples .<-->N
If students are later to live the lives membership in the American democracy expects , provision must be made for them to live such lives within the school .<-->O
The High School and Democracy , The first and perhaps the most important activity in the whole school program is student participation in the government of the school .<-->O
In the final analysis , it is citizenship which is the first aim of the high school .<-->N
In a circular recently sent out by the State STUDENT PAETICIPATION 61 Department of Education of the state of Penn - sylvania dealing with , the subject of student and faculty activities the following statement ap - peared : The success of our democratic '' government and social order depends upon the intelligence , the conscience , and the skill with which the great mass of our people at - tack our political , social , and economical problems .<-->O
The public high school is the one institution through which society can most directly and purposefully attack the problems of developing the intelligence , the conscience , and the skill essential to successful democracy .<-->O
It is owned and run by society ; it is open on equal terms , to all the children of all the people ; it has under its daily influence the group from which will come nearly all the leaders of thought and sentiment in the coining generations ' ; and perhaps most important of all it has them at the time when they are more responsive to social appeals than at any other period of their lives .<-->O
Clearly the first duty of the high school is ; to make its charges intelligent concerning the history , the phi - , losophy , and the problems of democracy .<-->O
It must en - list the personal devotion of our young people to the welfare of democracy at once , by showing them how inex - tricably their own happiness is involved in this welfare , and by appealing to their idealism , dominant in adoles - cence as in no other period .<-->O
As the enacting clause of its - instruction and of its emotional and ethical appeals , it must train in thosa skills that shall make the knowledge and devotion dy - namic in producing a better democratic social order .<-->O
The high school has an unparalleled opportunity to de - velop these skills .<-->O
Its problems are real , not make - believe ; the welfare of the group depends upon cooper - 62 EXTRA-CUEEICULAB ACTIVITIES ation and demands the subordination of individual to group interests ; the responsibility and authority of the groups must be delegated to leaders ; indeed , the success of the school depends upon a high standard of intelli - gence , conscience , and skill in solving the problems of the school community .<-->O
If good citizenship is the product of proper knowl - edge , right ideals , and correct habits , and if it consists of being able and desirous of playing one 's full part in the cooperative activities of one 's , community , state and nation , then it is obvious that education for such .<-->O
Citizenship must aim at creating social intelligence in citizens , on the one hand , and at increasing cooperation to a maximum , on the other hand .<-->O
Immediate Aims .<-->N
One of the immediate aims of student participation in the government of the school is the teaching and practice of self - control .<-->N
; The Latimer , Junior High School of Pittsburgh , appreciating this truth , keeps this motto prominently before its students at all times : `` Do it because it is right . ''<-->O
As the basis of achievement , self-control is the very begin - ning of right discipline .<-->O
Closely related is the aim of self-reliance Every student must be led to see that he is an important and integral part of the school com - munity , and that the school community will be just as good as he helps to make it .<-->O
He must earn that to do the right thing he must rely on limself .<-->O
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 63 In former years the teacher sought to control his pupils .<-->N
The modern aim is to have the pupils control themselves .<-->N
But this can happen only when the teacher gives abundant opportunity for free choice .<-->O
Now is the time of life in which the students are peculiarly affected by a craving for freedom , self-reliance , and the chance to show what they can do by themselves .<-->O
A third aim is the recognition and encourage - ment which student participation gives to initia - tive .<-->N
A student-government organization af - fords every opportunity for such encourage - ment .<-->O
Every chance is given for the boy or girl actually to participate in the management of the school .<-->N
An attitude which welcomes sug - gestions from the students ought to be a part of the plan and , whenever possible , the students should be given an opportunity to try out their own methods to see whether or not they will function in practice .<-->O
They should see for them - selves .<-->N
Such activity is perhaps the best de - veloper there is of initiative .<-->O
There are plenty of school experiences , exigencies , and difficulties to test this ability fully .<-->O
A fourth aim is the discovery and develop - !<-->N
ment of leadership .<-->N
In student participation lies a chance that this much-sought & nd rare human quality may be discovered , detected , and 64 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES developed .<-->N
Consideration of this as an aim sug - gests several questions : L Do we need leaders ?<-->N
What should the schools do about develop - ing leaders ?<-->F
Should they select the superior minds and train them for leadership ?<-->F
What studies contribute most to developing leadership ?<-->F
What experiences contribute most ?<-->F
Are leaders born , or can leadership be de - veloped ?<-->F
What are the essentials of leadership ?<-->N
Surely there is no greater need in the Ameri - can democracy today than a diversified and bal - anced leadership .<-->O
The best thing the schools can do about developing leaders is to furnisli the opportunity .<-->O
If fundamentals are well es - tablished in the mind of a boy or girl , if the pupils have good character and are given the opportunity to do things , if they can be encour - aged to broaden their school work so as to in - clude participation in the different school ac - tivities , there is no doubt but that qualities of leadership will be developed .<-->O
The surest way to develop leadership in stu - dents is to place responsibility upon them and EH D O O CO w o o STUDENT PARTICIPATION 65 then guide and direct their efforts .<-->N
Qualities of leadership are adaptability ; quick , clear think - ing ; initiative ; integrity ; self-confidence ; broad vision ; tact ; good judgment ; willingness to work ; unselfishness ; imagination ; faith ; courage ; and enthusiasm .<-->O
Teachers should be on the lookout for these qualities .<-->N
Embryo leaders may thus be discov - ered , and the opportunity offered for develop - ing them .<-->O
Leaders do not necessarily come from among those with the highest `` I. Q. 's . ''<-->N
They sometimes come from the most unsuspected sources .<-->N
They are not necessarily born leaders .<-->N
They must , of course , be endowed with a certain mental equipment , but education and practice will contribute more than a small share in train - ing leaders .<-->O
The question of leadership is a big one , and in this connection more than a brief consideration can not be attempted .<-->N
The fifth aim is the establishment of oppor - tunity for cooperation . .<-->N
One , of the primary agcjBgsijgj.es Jn preparation for democratic ^ life JLS worthy coop ^ ^ lMJU ^ There is something woe - fully lacking in a citizenship which does no more than obey the law and refrain from infringe - ment upon the rights of others .<-->O
In too many schools the aim encouraged by the actual conduct of the work is of a type whicl 66 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES lays major stress upon `` looking out all the time for number one . ''<-->O
Eight thinking can no longer conceive of democracy as mainly a matter of everyone for himself within the limits of the law .<-->N
That conception is altogether too common .<-->N
Dr. Dewey has pointed out that this conception is symbolized by the very equipment of the or - dinary classroom : Each pupil sits by himself at a desk , which is fastened immovably to its place .<-->N
Each occupies his own little island , from which as a general rule communication with all other islands is forbidden .<-->O
This rigid separation typifies the im - portance attached to the virtues of non-interference .<-->N
The class acts as a group only in obedience to orders from headquarters .<-->N
This method overlooks the fact that while even in a democracy orders must be obeyed , the rules are not decreed by an autocrat but are willed by the group itself .<-->O
Responsibility for the success or failure in the exe - cution rests with those who * not only obey the orders but make them .<-->O
A school of any reasonable size furnishes ample opportunity for cooperative effort .<-->O
The writer visited a high school in another city re - cently , and the first thing to attract his attention upon entering the door of the building was a motto reading as follows : `` We work in coopera - tion . ''<-->N
Within a very few minutes it was appar - ent that this motto was a functioning , vital force in that school among all : administrators , faculty , and student body .<-->O
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 67 A sixth aim is the establishment of high i of citizenship .<-->N
Participation of students in their school government does more than train for citizenship in the narrow sense .<-->N
It is an effec - tive solution of many of the student problems arising in every school .<-->N
The opportunity for active participation in social and local political problems thus afforded furnishes an outlet for that exuberant activity of youth so likely to ex - press itself in unworthy forms when no legiti - mate outlets are provided .<-->O
Propensity for se - cret socities , , social cliques , and such undesir - able by-products of the usual system of school control is simply the self - directed expression of the student 's social proclivities .<-->O
participation develops the student It fosters democracy , fair play , uni selfish service , consideration !<-->O
for the rights ofj others , and respect for the law of the social group .<-->O
It can not be too strongly emphasized that the purpose of democratic student coopera - tion in school control is neither merely disci - pline nor better management - of details .<-->O
In this there is scant evidence that democracy is more efficient than is despotism at its best .<-->O
The ad - vantages of democracy are largely spiritual , and the beneficent results of democratic school ad - ministration are to be found in habits of thought , 68 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES feeling , and action , rather tlian in mere con - formity to rules .<-->O
However efficient its organiza - tion and its instruction in mere subject matter , the American high school fails in its most im - portant function if it fails to develop the qual - ities of good democratic citizenship .<-->O
High ideals of citizenship should be kept prominently before the students all the time .<-->N
In one junior high school the following poster is found in a prominent place in every classroom : IDEALS FOR WHICH EACH ASPIRANT K > R CITIZENSHIP SHOULD STRIVE 1 .<-->N
Qualities ' that make for true citizenship ; High sense of honor .<-->O
Doing of right because it is right .<-->O
Initiative , that is , resourcefulness , enthusiasm , and leadership shown in voluntary service for the school .<-->O
Passing grades in all subjects , resulting from earnest effort .<-->N
Growth in self-control , consideration for the rights of others , and a sense of civic responsibility .<-->O
The seventh aim is a little more general in character .<-->N
It is that more or less indefinite something popularly called school spirit .<-->O
j3ch & Ql spirit j & essentially a disposition of mind on the STUDENT PARTICIPATION '' 69 part of students jKhieh - lijolds dear the ideals of As a vital means of developing school spirit , student government holds a rare place .<-->O
There ^ should be no mistake about the value of school spirit as a moving force .<-->O
It may be developed to such an extent that its force is felt through - out the school and even beyond the school in the community .<-->O
This is of real value to the community as well as the school , because in the final analysis there is only the difference of contact between school spirit and community spirit .<-->O
School-spirit activity is simply practice * - ^ ^ f | ill , ^ y , ^ i rTc-r M T * < ^ ~ J ^ n * ^ * i a ** ' .<-->N

Other aims wEich might be developed in this discussion are : EIGHTH : Ability to see the other side of a question .<-->N

TENTH : Eespect for law and order , or sense of distinction between liberty and license .<-->O
CHAPTER V STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN HIGH SCHOOL CONTROL -LRB- Continued -RRB- Elements of Success .<-->N
Student-government or - ganizations are not new .<-->F
Many plans have been tried throughout the country with varying de - grees of success .<-->N
Many efforts along this line have been complete failures .<-->N
The reason for such failures may often be traced to the fact that the organizations were adopted as disciplinary measures .<-->O
Better discipline undoubtedly comes as a by-product of student participation in school control but it ought not to be the primary purpose of the organization .<-->O
Let it be kept con - stantly in mind that the primary purpose of such an organization is training in junior citi - zenship .<-->O
If student participation in high school control is to be successful , certain fundamental points must be kept in mind .<-->O
In the first place there must be a realization of the need for such an organization by both faculty members and pupils .<-->O
Before putting a student-government organization into effect in 70 STUDENT PARTICIPATION 71 a certain Mgli school , the writer appointed a committee of faculty members , with an enthu - siastic chairman , to mate a complete study of the whole question .<-->N
The committee was in - structed to make a complete and formal report to the entire faculty by the close of the first semester .<-->O
The members had almost five months to study the question and make the report .<-->N
When it was finally ready , it was submitted to the faculty and an opportunity for discussion allowed .<-->O
The discussion was thorough and dem - ocratic , and several changes were suggested .<-->N
Then it was put to a vote and adopted unani - mously by the faculty of seventy-two members - .<-->N
It was understood that the plan should be given a fair trial and that during the trial the group should give it undivided support .<-->O
When the matter was submitted to the students in their home rooms , it easily gained adoption .<-->N
It has been the experience of many , more than once , that faculty members have often stood in the way of progress , not the students .<-->N
Faculty sup - port , enthusiastic and hearty , must be given to any plan for student participation , or it will be doomed to failure .<-->O
Secondly , teachers and stu - dents must be thoroughly familiar with the plan before it is put into effect .<-->N
The way for its adoption and operation must be prepared .<-->N
72 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES It is possible to accomplish , this largely in the activities period , through class or home-room discussion .<-->O
In the third place , student participation in government should be introduced gradually * It is not wise to try to put all of such a plan as is described in this volume into effect at once .<-->O
A fourth point to be borne in mind is that a plan to be successful must be a simple one , adapted to local needs .<-->O
No one has a patent on any one plan .<-->N
One suited to the needs of a jun - ior high school ought perhaps to be considerably altered to suit a senior high school or a junior - senior high school .<-->O
Similarly , the best plan ever devised for a large high school might have to be modified to meet the needs ` of a small high school .<-->O
In the fifth place , there must be constant , in - visible supervision .<-->N
It is because of a lack of this element that many plans fail to accom - plisH results .<-->N
Every member of the teaching staff must be alert to see that things run smoothly .<-->N
It is the business of faculty members to act in this connection as guidance directors .<-->N
They should be careful , however , not to inter - fere with or destroy initiative .<-->O
Students should never be allowed to get the idea that the prin-j cipal and faculty are not the final authority in the school .<-->N
Legally constituted authority mnsl STUDENT PARTICIPATION 73 be clearly understood to reside in them under all circumstances .<-->O
Since the author may be misunderstood in re - lation to this fifth point , it might be well to call the attention of the reader to the fact that in - visible supervision means that these junior citi - zens are likely to need sympathy and help all along the line .<-->O
It does not mean a constant in - terference with the freedom of the students in the matter of working out their plans , but it does mean an alertness to detect weakness and fail - ure and a ready response in giving suggestions and helpful direction .<-->O
Too many high school principals in former days were too ready to turn the control and discipline of the school over entirely to the student body with inevitable failure as the result .<-->O
This attitude is in no way contrary to the spirit of democracy and freedom of action advo - cated by the author .<-->O
Junior citizens in either a junior or senior high school are not ready for - self-government any more than the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands were ready for self - government when the United States assumed control .<-->O
They need guidance and direction in their activities but should be given plenty of op - portunity to practice citizenship with the mini - mum of help needed to assure success .<-->O
74 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES In pursuance of this thought it might be stated that when absolute veto power is advocated for the principal it does not mean that he is going to stand in the way of suggestions from the stu - dent body but it does mean that his approval must be secured before new policies can become effective .<-->O
No one would assume that these jun - ior citizens could pass measures over the veto of the principal .<-->O
As a sixth point the necessity of avoiding any conception of student participation x in .<-->N
govern - ment as a disciplinary device might be men - tioned .<-->N
This has already been noted , but it needs to be emphasized .<-->N
In the seventh place , there must be direct re - sponsibility in the supervision and direction of the Student-Government Organization .<-->N
An or - ganization such as this will not run itself .<-->N
Un - less the school is small , it is necessary that the principal appoint a faculty member to supervise the work of the organization .<-->N
In a school with an enrollment of eighteen hundred , the writer found it advisable to place the supervision of the organization in the hands of a person devot - ing half time to the task .<-->N
This meant that the teacher appointed gave one half of every day to supervision .<-->N
Education in the area of the arts has often been regarded as extras , and when administrators look for ways to trim the annual budget , the arts typically received the biggest cut in the curriculum .<-->O
When educators look to strengthen core academic subjects , the arts receive little credit in developing the competency of student skills in the traditional academic subjects such as math , science , English , history , and foreign language .<-->O
Arguments for budget cuts to the arts have forced the disciplines of music , visual art , dance , and dramatic arts to provide a convincing and thorough justification for their place within the school curriculum .<-->O
Malouf -LRB- 1998 -RRB- quoted the director of college counseling at St. Marks School , a most prestigious college preparatory program in Dallas , Texas , as saying , It turns out that kids who are involved in extra-curricular activities are more likely to be successful students .<-->O
Theyre generally motivated to do the schoolwork that allows them to keep doing the activities that they love .<-->O
Outside pressure may result in burnout .<-->N
But self-pressure they can endure -LRB- p. 44 -RRB- .<-->N
Historically , motivation plays a key role in the academic success of each student .<-->O
Dewey -LRB- 1913 -RRB- writes , Persons , children or adults , are interested in what they 2 can do successfully , in what they approach with confidence and engage in with a sense of accomplishment .<-->O
Such happiness or interest is not self-conscious or selfish ; it is a sign of developing power and of absorption in what is being done -LRB- p. 35 -RRB- .<-->O
The interest for this study developed from the following personal observations : 1 -RRB- As a faculty participant at more than twenty high school graduation ceremonies , observations of a pattern emerged .<-->N
Valedictorians and salutatorians were usually musicians .<-->N
2 -RRB- House Bill 588 mandated from the Texas legislature dictated that the top ten percent of each graduation class in Texas would automatically be admitted to state colleges and the top eleven to twenty-five percent with the required SAT or ACT score would also be automatic admits .<-->O
A second observation was that among the students considered for automatic admission to a state college -LRB- i.e. the top ten percent and top eleven to twenty-five percent -RRB- , musicians and fine arts participants were consistently prominent in class rank .<-->O
3 -RRB- A third observation was made at the annual meetings of The College Board in 1998 and 1999 .<-->N
Each year , The College Board recognizes the top AP Scholars from across the United States .<-->N
This honor is achieved through perfect scores on the AP examinations , and the students honored are not set in number and vary from six to twelve 3 students each year .<-->O
Consistently , the majority of AP Scholars honored have been musicians and participants in other fine arts .<-->N
Students who do not participate in school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities often cite the desire to spend more time on academic work and believe that the school sponsored , extra-curricular activities involve too much time , placing a strain on time that could be devoted to academic work .<-->O
This study was designed to determine whether a tenuous cause-effect relationship could be established between participation/non participation in school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities and academic achievement at a private school in north central Texas .<-->O
The study included the activities of music , dramatic arts , visual arts , athletics , and non-participation -LRB- i.e. choosing not to participate in school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities -RRB- .<-->N
The component of dance , albeit an art form , was not included in this study as dance was not a school-sponsored , extra-curricular activity at the school in this study .<-->N
The school-sponsored , athletic extra-curricular activities in this study included football , volleyball , soccer , wrestling , baseball , softball , basketball , tennis , golf , and swimming .<-->N
The aforementioned fine arts and athletics were the only school-sponsored activities offered at the school .<-->N
Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study was to determine whether a cause-effect relationship existed between participation/non-participation in school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities -LRB- fine arts and athletics -RRB- and the academic development of students beginning with grade nine and concluding with grade twelve at a private north central Texas school .<-->N
The study compared subgroups of the graduates , comparing the SAT scores , ACT scores , 4 and cumulative grade point averages of student participants or non-participants in school sponsored , extra-curricular activities -LRB- fine arts and athletics -RRB- .<-->N
In addition to males and females , the graduates were divided into the following five subgroups : 1 -RRB- Musicians -LRB- vocal and instrumental -RRB- , 2 -RRB- Thespians , 3 -RRB- Visual artists , 4 -RRB- Athletes -LRB- students who participate in varsity sports -RRB- , and 5 -RRB- Non-Participants -LRB- students who do not participate in school - sponsored , extra-curricular activities -RRB- .<-->O
It should be noted that , at this particular school , dance was not offered , and the fine arts opportunities at the school were limited to vocal and instrumental music , visual arts , and dramatic arts .<-->O
It should also be noted that the only school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities offered are fine arts and athletics .<-->N
The school did not sponsor any clubs that would be considered extra-curricular activities .<-->N
The criteria for membership in each of the aforementioned school-sponsored , extra-curricular groups was a minimum level of participation in that group for at least two of the four high school years in grades nine through twelve .<-->N
A total population of four hundred and forty-nine students met the criteria for inclusion in this study .<-->N
After eliminating students who cross participate , i.e. those who participate in two or more of the subgroups , a total of three hundred sixty-one student records were included in the study .<-->N
Eliminating students who participate in multiple activities helped to preserve the integrity of the subgroups .<-->N
5 This study attempted to determine whether a cause-effect relationship existed between participation in school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities and cumulative grade point averages earned , SAT scores , and ACT scores for students at a private school in north central Texas .<-->N
The study offered important information to administrators , instructors , parents , and students .<-->N
For administrators , the findings of this study may influence future school budgets and curriculum development .<-->N
For instructors , this research could help to create an awareness of the important impact of extra-curricular activities on classroom achievement may help to create a more positive learning environment .<-->O
If the cause-effect relationship is established , educators may then plan for the integration of the arts into the classroom activities and no longer consider these activities as exclusively extra-curricular .<-->O
For students and parents , the findings of this study may assist in the comprehensive planning of courses to take or which extra curricular activities to engage in during grades nine through twelve .<-->N
Eisner -LRB- 2000 -RRB- offered the following suggestion for reshaping the curriculum .<-->N
The times seem receptive to the possibilities of the arts as a way not only to enrich human experience in its own right , but also to promote the development of what might be too narrowly called mental skills -LRB- p. 4 -RRB- .<-->O
Eisner continued to state that past standards for the arts within the school curriculum have been problematic largely due to the fact that educators outside of the arts areas formulated the policies .<-->O
He suggested that since formal curriculum planning had incorporated 6 everything else without resounding success , that it may be time to give arts educators an opportunity to produce a curriculum that would include the infusion of the arts .<-->O
Many theories revolve around the impact of the arts , specifically music , to the development of intellectual achievement .<-->N
However , very little previous research actually verified those theories for students in grades nine through twelve .<-->O
This study has the potential to add significantly to the current literature by determining whether a cause effect relationship can be established between participation or non-participation in school-sponsored , extra-curricular fine arts activities or athletic activities and academic achievement .<-->O
The study could potentially impact the core curriculum by contributing to the research evidence supporting the inclusion or continuation of the arts as and important part of the school curriculum .<-->N
Research Questions The study investigated five research questions as follows : 1 -RRB- What is the effect of participation or non-participation in school sponsored , extra-curricular activities -LRB- i.e. music , drama , visual arts , and athletics -RRB- on the high school cumulative grade point average ?<-->O
2 -RRB- What is the effect of participation or non-participation in school sponsored , extra-curricular activities -LRB- i.e. music , drama , visual arts , and athletics -RRB- on high school SAT scores ?<-->N
3 -RRB- What is the effect of participation or non-participation in school sponsored , extra-curricular activities -LRB- i.e. music , drama , visual arts , and athletics -RRB- on the high school ACT scores ?<-->N
7 4 -RRB- Does the gender of participants in school-sponsored , extra curricular activities -LRB- i.e. music , drama , visual arts , and athletics -RRB- and of non-participants make a difference in their cumulative grade point averages , SAT scores , and ACT scores ?<-->O
5 -RRB- What is the effect of participation or non-participation in school sponsored , extra-curricular activities -LRB- i.e. music , drama , visual arts , and athletics -RRB- on cumulative subject grade point averages earned in computer science , foreign language , history/English -LRB- an interdisciplinary course at the school studied -RRB- , mathematics , and science ?<-->N
Significance of the Study This study has the potential to add to the existing literature .<-->N
Several research studies have been completed on younger students and the influence of activities , especially music , to the growth and development of the child .<-->N
Very little research has been conducted on students at the high school age level regarding their choices of school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities as it relates to academic growth and achievement .<-->O
Limitations of the Study The study was limited by the parameters of school-sponsored high school extra curricular activity participation at a private school in north central Texas .<-->O
At the school included in this study , the school-sponsored fine arts activities included band , choir , 8 chorale , theater arts , and visual arts .<-->N
While dance was recognized as a fine art , it was not a school-sponsored activity and was , therefore , not included in this study .<-->O
The study was also limited due to its causal-comparative nature .<-->N
The alleged cause had previously occurred , and students were not randomly assigned to subgroups .<-->N
Thus , it was possible that the subgroups differed in some significant way other than the independent variable of music , drama , visual arts , athletics , and non-participants .<-->O
This study was limited to students at one school .<-->N
Thus , the findings of this study may not transfer beyond the local setting .<-->F
All students at the school progressed through a curriculum with the following common features : 1 -RRB- A minimum of two years of foreign language .<-->F
2 -RRB- Four years of English and history .<-->F
3 -RRB- Four years of mathematics with a range from algebra I through calculus BC -LRB- the highest level of calculus offered during high school -RRB- .<-->F
4 -RRB- Three laboratory sciences consisting of biology , physics , and chemistry .<-->N
5 -RRB- Computer science is not a requirement for graduation ; therefore , it is considered an optional course .<-->N
Delimitations of the Study The study did not consider whether a student had participated in the fine arts and athletic activities prior to the ninth grade year of high school .<-->O
While it was possible that an athlete may have also participated in fine arts at an earlier age , it was equally possible for a fine arts person to have been in competitive athletics at an earlier age .<-->O
However , the question under study is the impact of school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities on 9 achievement during high school -LRB- grades nine through twelve -RRB- , and due to the sanction and uniform regulations of high school participation throughout the state of Texas , the study was limited to participation during grades nine through twelve only .<-->O
When calculating the grade point average , no consideration or weight was allowed for course work designated as honors level or Advanced Placement level in foreign language , English/history -LRB- an interdisciplinary course at this school -RRB- , mathematics , science , and computer science .<-->N
Participation in honors and/or Advanced Placement course work was not controlled for in this study when calculating the cumulative grade point average .<-->N
For example , a mathematics student could have taken any of the mathematics courses beginning with algebra I and including geometry , algebra II , pre-calculus , calculus AB , and calculus BC .<-->N
Basic Assumptions of the Study One assumption was that the school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities available to the students described in this study were consistent .<-->N
A second assumption was that school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities defined as music , dramatic arts , visual arts , and athletics were the only available activities and that no other participation in these activities outside of school-sponsored , activities occurred .<-->N
A third assumption was that participation in fine arts and athletics prior to grade nine did not significantly impact the data presented .<-->N
While athletes may have participated in one of the fine arts areas , it is also possible that the fine arts students may have participated in athletics and that the non-participants could have participated in either or both school-sponsored , extra curricular activities .<-->O
However , since the question under study was the impact of such 10 activities on cumulate grade point averages and test score achievement during grades nine through twelve , participation or lack of participation was limited to only grade levels nine through twelve .<-->O

The study presented by Hanshumaker -LRB- 1980 -RRB- promoted the theory that development exists as a process whereby there are windows in the development of the brain that educators can use to improve the potential mental capacity .<-->N
More specifically , as a child grows and develops , the stimulus that is received by the brain actually impacts how the brain develops .<-->N
Learning to play a musical instrument develops interaction between both the right and left sides of the brain .<-->N
Hanshumakers study included a random sample of second grade elementary students from four different schools .<-->N
His conclusion was that 15 music further improves the coordination of hands , eyes , ears , and exposes creative emotion .<-->O
The Gemeinhardt Company , a maker of musical instruments , conducted a study in 1980 of band parents , non-band parents , band students , non-band students , and drop-out band students .<-->N
Using a survey instrument , the conclusions regarding the value of band participation was reported as follows : ninety-one percent of the band parents , ninety percent of the drop-out band parents , seventy-nine percent of the non-band students , and eighty-two percent of the band students were in agreement that participation in band builds self-esteem , self-confidence , and a sense of accomplishment -LRB- Mickela , 2000 -RRB- .<-->O
This sense of achievement promotes a positive lifestyle and self-fulfillment .<-->O
Chapman -LRB- 1998 -RRB- offered a possible connection between art and learning .<-->N
His theory of studying the discipline of art , stated that art helped students learn to view artworks in an analytical way rather than an emotional way .<-->O
Thus , the analytical skills developed in art instruction which train the student to mentally unwrap and interpret art are then transferred to other disciplines as logical thinking skills and a higher order of problem solving promoting a sense of maturation to a responsible lifestyle .<-->O
The Getty Foundation sponsored the North Texas Institute for Educators on the Visual Arts as one of six such programs designed to train educators in applications for integrating the arts into the traditional curriculum .<-->N
Each institute provided the educational expertise , organizational structure , and resources for networking opportunities that might facilitate a sweeping change in arts education .<-->O
The institute , which provided opportunities 16 for a new focus on academic achievement through innovative teaching , considered the arts as a comprehensive whole and as part of the mainstream curriculum .<-->O
The arts stimulate creativity and promote critical thinking skills , transcending to a variety of core subjects .<-->O
Gorden Shaw , professor at the University of California , Irvine , concluded from his neuroscience research that the arts teach spatial-temporal reasoning .<-->N
With the ability to reason through space and time , students may begin to see the whole puzzle rather than the pieces , and according to the Gestalt Theory , the whole is considered to be greater than the sum of its parts .<-->O
The ability to develop keen spatial-temporal reasoning may help the students to perform well in subjects such as math , science , and engineering .<-->O
Shaw states that when students learn to play the piano , they begin thinking ahead in patterns .<-->N
The ability to think ahead in patterns requires the same thinking process used in critical thinking skills , which are vital to subject areas such as math , science , and foreign language -LRB- Rubiner 1997 -RRB- .<-->O
The science of neurobiology is still at the dawn of its existence in determining experiences that impact the brain and how it is wired .<-->N
Before an infant can utter a word , there are sounds .<-->N
Plato stated , Music is a more potent instrument than any other form of education -LRB- Hancock , 1996 , p. 58 -RRB- .<-->N
As described in Hancock -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , the results of a convincing study conducted on preschoolers involved one group that took piano lessons and sang daily .<-->N
One group studied piano and sang , while the other group did not .<-->N
At the end of the study , the three-year-olds who studied music were puzzle masters .<-->O
On spatial intelligence tests , which involve the ability to visualize the world accurately , these 17 students scored eighty percent higher than the three-year-olds who were not exposed to music .<-->O
However , even more compelling results , as described by Wilcox -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , demonstrated similar improvements for students who were considered disadvantaged .<-->O
The obvious conclusion is that music can be a great tool to level the playing field or if removed from the curriculum to then economically divide it .<-->O
In general , curriculum specialists view art and science as polar opposites .<-->N
Root Bernstein -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , a Professor of Physiology at Michigan State University , suggested that they are not .<-->N
He stated that the sciences are viewed as objective , intellectual , analytical , reproducible , and useful , while the arts are viewed as subjective , sensual , empathic , unique , and frivolous .<-->O
He also believes that scientists use the arts as scientific tools to gain insights into scientific discoveries .<-->N
Historical evidence indicates that the sciences and technology flourish only in the presence of the arts and that societies without emphasis on the arts are lacking in the technological and scientific arenas .<-->O
Scientists and engineers find it necessary to use the skills often learned from the arts , which include the following abilities : to observe acutely ; to think spatially and kinesthetically ; to identify essential components of a complicated whole ; to recognize and invent patterns ; to gain a feeling of being empathy ; and to visually , verbally , and mathematically communicate the results of thinking .<-->O
The paradigm is that millions of education dollars are spent on the sciences , while all the arts combined receive less than any one single science in terms of curriculum support .<-->O
The spatial-temporal approach enhanced by the study of music can easily be generalized to other disciplines within the curriculum .<-->N
For example , math and Science concepts are made easier when proportions and fractions -LRB- products of spatial - 18 temporal reasoning -RRB- are comprehended as a by-product of music study -LRB- Graziano , 1999 -RRB- .<-->N
At the John Eliot Elementary School in Needham , Massachusetts , music fills the day .<-->N
After recess , the teacher may play a piece that contains sixty beats a minute to bring the students back into a more calm sense of being .<-->O
When they study the solar system , Gustav Holsts , The Planets can be heard .<-->N
When the Boston Tea Party was the lesson topic , students composed their own songs and poetry about the historical event .<-->N
As a result , when the John Eliot students took their state achievement test which has a possible score of 1600 , no student at John Eliot scored less than 1570 for their respective grade level -LRB- Foreman , 1997 -RRB- .<-->O
Brain-based education follows a constructivist learning model .<-->N
Therefore , brain based learning is active learning as demonstrated in the paragraph above about the John Eliot School .<-->O
Students receive input from a variety of senses , and the constructivist classroom educator should present the materials to be mastered in a variety of ways to create a learning environment designed to reach many different learners .<-->N
Bruer -LRB- 1999 -RRB- wrote that teachers should teach meaning and understanding , not just facts .<-->O
To teach in a constructivist way suggests that the teacher creates a low-threat , high-challenge atmosphere whereby the students enjoy complex experiences .<-->N
Bruer suggested that this environment is not limited to the brain-based learning theory but is created out of understanding of cognitive and developmental psychology .<-->O
However , when one applied the two theories together , developmental psychology provided the software for the hardware of the neurological functions .<-->N
In other words , brain-based learning attempted to see the parts within the whole , realizing that the Gestalt Theory applies as the whole 19 becomes greater than the sum of its parts .<-->N
The application to this research is that -LRB- a -RRB- learning is not isolated non-art subject matter and -LRB- b -RRB- the arts , in fact , may contribute greatly to the education of the whole student as students study core curriculum subject matter throughout the formal education curriculum .<-->O
Educating the whole student includes a curriculum rich in the arts .<-->N
Cortines -LRB- 1999 -RRB- wrote , Educators say they want materials and activities that are constructivist that is , concrete and hands-on .<-->N
They seek materials that are multi modal , multi cultural , appealing and challenging to the classrooms diverse range of learners .<-->N
They look for activities that provide not just one means of assessment but multiple ways to track and evaluate a students progress .<-->O
They want materials that promote critical thinking .<-->O
They look for activities that are interdisciplinary .<-->N
Research confirms what we always knew intuitively : the arts teach all of us -- students and teachers alike -- innovation , novelty , and creativity .<-->N
We learn to be wondrous -LRB- p. 6 -RRB- .<-->N
The school offering a wide range of speech , drama , broadcasting , creative writing , art , photography , and music courses is said to have a wide impact on traditional subjects within the curriculum .<-->O
Cortines -LRB- 1999 -RRB- contended that the arts ... teach students where to look and what to look for in gathering support for an idea .<-->O
They also help students learn 20 to give , to accept , and to follow constructive criticism ; listen courteously and critically as others speak ; become more logical , more direct , and more creative in organizing thoughts for presentation ; learn to control the fear of speaking or performing before an audience , and , as a result , become a more confident person -LRB- p. 61 -RRB- .<-->O
Longley -LRB- 1999 -RRB- also made a case for arts literacy by suggesting that the arts are advantageous in developing the four Cs of education : communication , culture , cognition , and creativity .<-->N
In his view , these four goals are not met merely with a few after school activities , albeit that is often the case .<-->O
Longley suggested that these four goals , communication , culture , cognition , and creativity , deserved a place in the front of the curriculum integrated into every learning opportunity .<-->O
Educators of the arts must be vocal and visual in expressing the importance of the arts as a means to stretch far beyond passive learning .<-->O
From Athletics to Academia To determine the possible influence of participation in athletics on academic achievement , statistics from the National Collegiate Athletic Association are relevant .<-->O
For college admissions personnel , the most difficult and guarded decisions made for admission to the college or university are the admits of student athletes .<-->O
Jean H. Fetter , former dean of undergraduate admissions at Stanford University , states , When the Stanford team does well , the coach gets a lot of credit ; when the team performs badly , the undergraduate admissions is held responsible -LRB- Congressional Quarterly , 1996 , p. 6 -RRB- .<-->O
21 One wonders whether the current standards set by the National Collegiate Athletic Association -LRB- NCAA -RRB- are actually quite generous and whether the NCAA places the value of participation above that of academic achievement .<-->O
For Division I and II schools , a student must have and maintain a grade point average of 2.0 or a C average .<-->N
In addition , athletes must score a minimum of 700 on the SAT test or a 17 on the ACT test .<-->N
This criterion is far below average for general college admission .<-->N
Does this imply that the athletes are not capable of scoring within the range of normal college admission standards ?<-->O
The NCAA has actually proposed standards that would eliminate the SAT or standardized testing as a requirement for athletic competition .<-->O
Part of the students academic record is standardized testing and one assumes that athletes have the ability equal to that of any other student to meet the set standards of admission .<-->N
The NCAA Register recorded that from August 1996 through March 1997 the NCAA received and processed two hundred forty-six requests by athletes to waive the minimal requirements to enter a Division I or II college or university .<-->N
Of the two hundred forty-six requests , one hundred eight -LRB- forty-four percent -RRB- were granted waivers -LRB- NCAA , 1997 -RRB- .<-->N
Vilelle -LRB- 1996 -RRB- accused the NCAA of hurting the athletic careers of three football players because they were not academically eligible to enroll at the University of Missouri and were , therefore , unable to practice with the football team .<-->O
The problem of eligibility of athletes is a problem consistent nationwide at colleges and universities , and it may be possible that athletes can also be academic achievers if given the opportunity or incentive to do so .<-->O
Unless the bar for academic achievement as a requirement to participate in 22 intercollegiate athletics is maintained , the prestige of earning a college diploma may suffer a great loss on the field and athletic court .<-->O
Texas A & M University -LRB- 1997 -RRB- produced a document outlining the policies for admitting athletes to the university .<-->N
The admission process for an athlete fell into four categories : 1 -RRB- Top ten percent of any Texas graduating class was an automatic admit under House Bill 588 ; 2 -RRB- Early Action , whereby a student met the minimum standard admission requirements ; 3 -RRB- Review , whereby some requirements were waived ; and 4 -RRB- Other , whereby most of the standard requirements were waived -LRB- p. 5 -RRB- .<-->O
One can only guess what message Review and Other must send to high school athletes regarding their academic achievement .<-->O
Is it not possible to be both a scholar and an athlete ?<-->N
Artists and Scholars Art can be more than a painting on an easel or clay on a wheel .<-->N
Integrating art and art appreciation into the curriculum can be a natural process .<-->N
Gardner -LRB- 2000 -RRB- contended that facts memorized become mere bits and pieces of knowledge .<-->O
Meaning occurs only when facts are combined into significant patterns .<-->N
Gardner stated , Think of facts as Christmas tree ornaments without the tree -LRB- p. 5 -RRB- .<-->N
To pull the facts together into something meaningful , Gardner suggested that the school curriculum embrace education for understanding which develops students understanding of truth , beauty , and goodness .<-->O
To understand the world is to understand Mozart or Picasso .<-->O
To have knowledge about the Holocaust is to have insight about Kosovo .<-->O
To understand biology is to understand computer viruses and so forth .<-->O
Art can bring a visual discipline into the classroom and , in a matter of moments , transform understanding .<-->N
Factual learning by itself is disjointed .<-->N
23 While it is not necessary to transform the curriculum and remove factual learning , it is possible to enhance the curriculum and provide multiple entry points for in-depth learning .<-->O
The College Board continues to facilitate workshop programs for educators designed to integrate the arts into the high school curriculum .<-->N
Relatively simplistic ideas and adjustments to presentations can turn a factual lesson into a meaningful one .<-->O
Nelson -LRB- 1998 -RRB- gave an example of a 1998 workshop for three hundred forty high schools across the United States that created a focal point of infusing the arts into English , math , science , and social studies when an appropriate fit was possible .<-->O
The institute featured two simplistic approaches : 1 -RRB- begin each lesson with a work of art ; and 2 -RRB- create a theme for the presentation .<-->N
The work of art could be a painting , sculpture , or perhaps -LRB- on a larger scale -RRB- an example of architecture , or a specific setting such as a garden , or scenic view .<-->O
Through the use of art , students found learning more stimulating rather than cataloging facts .<-->O
In this century of technology and multimedia , there is little excuse for the absence of creating a rich environment in which learning can be achieved through many of the five senses .<-->O
Anderson -LRB- 1995 -RRB- wrote , In most cultures , through time , art has not been for arts sake , but for lifes sake -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- .<-->N
In the field of history , it should be noted that in early Western civilization the arts as individual disciplines did not exist .<-->N
Specifically , music was not isolated from dance and painting rather the arts were considered to be a whole .<-->O
A 1991 project called FLARE , which was developed in part by the California Institute of Technology , designed an art project to develop the mastery of language and visual arts as well as an understanding of diverse cultures through the integration of art into the school 24 core curriculum .<-->O
Aschbacher -LRB- 1996 -RRB- stated that FLARE was not an add-on or frill to the curriculum , but it had the potential to be a stimulus for learning and communication of rather complex concepts .<-->O
Programs such as FLARE introduce students to the world of art and artists while encouraging involvement and active participation in visual arts .<-->O
To Be or Not To Be The grandest stage in the world is life , and everyone is a player or actor .<-->N
The classroom becomes a live stage .<-->N
Some scenes are high drama , while others appear mundane .<-->O
Drama does indeed take place in everyday life .<-->N
Manzo -LRB- 1997 -RRB- stated that humanities and the arts are the contenders for school reform .<-->N
For example , public speaking is a necessary part of life .<-->N
Speech and debate training , considered part of the dramatic arts , remain necessary skills for success at the collegiate level and in the work force .<-->O
While innate to some , these are skills which can be acquired .<-->N
Despite the lack of funding for programs and special classes in the dramatic arts , it is possible and relatively simple to integrate public speaking and debate into the classroom with any subject throughout the curriculum .<-->O
For example , almost any subject can provide opportunities for dyads , triads , and Socratic style teaching whereby students communicate and ponder -LRB- debate -RRB- the discovered material and subject matter .<-->O
Public speaking and dramatic arts , therefore , become important in the development of the whole person .<-->O
Self-esteem and achievement may therefore be significantly impacted by participation in dramatic arts .<-->O
Barrett -LRB- 1997 -RRB- completed a survey of art college CEOs , and found that their number one need for curricular change was a well-rounded high school curriculum .<-->O
The presence of dramatic arts in no way dilutes the academic content of a strong curriculum .<-->O
25 Jensen -LRB- 1998 -RRB- stated that if classroom dramas , open discussions , writing , and music are introduced within the first few minutes of class , they can effectively level the playing field for student achievement by taping into multiple interests .<-->O
These short bursts of learning become crucial to building a powerful memory bank .<-->N
Meaningless information will be discarded , while important information will become encoded .<-->O
Wolfe -LRB- 1998 -RRB- wrote that scientists have become aware that the brain absorbs the environment and then reassembles the observations to make connections to enhance life .<-->N
If speaking were genetic , then a child raised in isolation would develop the ability to communicate verbally on his/her own .<-->O
Therefore , the brain is not fixed when it comes to verbal communication and speech is an activity which can be learned .<-->N
Active participation in dramatic arts as well as observation generates a rich environment and serves as a conduit to make the connections between knowledge and understanding .<-->O
Biernat -LRB- 1989 -RRB- researched studies continue to show that participation in extra curricular activities is beneficial to students .<-->O
Success at the college level can be predicted more accurately by looking at student activity involvement than by the SAT or ACT scores .<-->N
Students who participate in dramatic arts have special value in the admissions decisions at colleges and universities .<-->O
Fred Hargadon , former Dean of Admissions at Stanford University , and the current Dean at Princeton University , states , We look for students who have taken part in orchestra , symphonic band , chorus and drama .<-->N
It shows a level of energy and an ability to organize time ... It shows that they can carry a full academic load and learn something else .<-->O
26 These students know how to get involved and thats the kind of college student that we want to have -LRB- Mickela , 2000 , p. 3 -RRB- .<-->O
The Mozart Effect The sounds we make from the beginning of life come from our human instrument .<-->N
Unless one is born with a hearing impairment , sound is a part of our life and culture from the first breath until the last .<-->N
Granted , not all music is created equal , but beauty is truly in the ears of the listener .<-->O
A tone is to an orchestral piece what a word is to a novel , and there is a wide range of in between .<-->N
Shaw -LRB- 2000 -RRB- revolutionized the listening industry in the mid nineties with his Mozart Effect -LRB- p. 205 -RRB- .<-->N
The Mozart Effect theory centered on music listening and stated that if infants listen to Mozart , they will have more profound development .<-->O
Despite this half-truth , half-myth , there is some science to the theory .<-->N
Carol Krumhansl , of Cornell University , stated that babies as young as four months can understand music structure -LRB- Foreman , 1997 -RRB- .<-->N
Krumhansls experiments included placing a baby in a dark room .<-->N
When a light was turned on , the baby would turn toward it .<-->O
As soon as the baby turned to the light , music would come on and stay on until the baby turned his/her head away .<-->O
Babies quickly associated the light with music .<-->N
When the babies heard a Mozart minuet just as Mozart wrote them , they remain focused until the cadence ended .<-->N
However , when the minuet was slowed down and the notes disjointed , the babies looked the other way .<-->N
Krumhansls conclusion was that it really didnt matter if the music was Mozart , any traditional classical music which provided structure and cadence was pleasing to an infant and helped them to concentrate and focus for longer periods of time thus increasing the attention span .<-->O
27 Wenger -LRB- 1990 -RRB- reported that neuroscientists believe that when musicians exercise the cortical neurons while playing music that the potential exists to improve mental functioning .<-->O
Specifically , mathematics , spatial reasoning skills , and critical reasoning skills seem to improve .<-->O
Cheek -LRB- 1999 -RRB- presented a study that investigated the relationship between music training and mathematics achievement .<-->N
One hundred thirteen students participated with all students receiving music training at school .<-->F
Thirty-six students also had private music lessons while seventy seven did not have private instruction .<-->F
All students had taken the Iowa Test of Basic Skills -LRB- ITBS -RRB- the previous year .<-->N
No significant difference was found between the ITBS math scores of females and males .<-->N
Twenty of the thirty-six students who received private lessons had taken lessons for two or more years , and the researchers concluded that students with two or more years of private lessons had a significantly higher mean mathematics score over the students who did not have private lessons .<-->N
Schlaug , a Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center neurologist -LRB- and also an accomplished organist -RRB- , stated that there is growing evidence of a critical period for learning .<-->O
Schlaugs research concluded that the first seven years of life is the window for brain development .<-->N
Schlaug says of perfect pitch , If you dont get exposed to music before age seven , it will not develop -LRB- Foreman , 1997 , p. 1 -RRB- .<-->O
Schlaug discovered that for musicians who begin playing before the age of seven , the corpus callosum is bigger than for those who began after the age of seven .<-->N
The corpus callosum is the structure that links both sides of the brain , enabling one to transfer from one side to the other very quickly .<-->N
28 There is much to be learned from music .<-->N
Most tasks are carried out on one side or the other of the brain ; however , in the musical student , both sides of the brain were equally strong .<-->N
Pet scans revealed that music is the only discipline that uses both sides of the brain at the same time .<-->N
The implications for brain plasticity are strong .<-->N
If synapses are created in a multiplicative factor -LRB- one makes two , two makes four , four makes eight , etc. -RRB- , then using both sides of the brain at the same time has the potential to create more plasticity and thus more synapses .<-->N
Goetinck -LRB- 1998 -RRB- wrote that scientists now have the ability to look inside of the brain and what they have discovered is that when a musician is playing music , both sides of the brain are activated .<-->N
Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio also have evidence that music is the only discipline that involves both sides of the brain at the same time .<-->N
A simple melody can evoke the most tender feelings , while the intricacies of melody and harmonic progressions can stir a crowd to a cause .<-->O
Shaw -LRB- 2000 -RRB- stated that music provides opportunities for understanding and developing higher brain function .<-->N
Shaw theorized that from birth a repertoire of inherent spatial-temporal firing patterns is born .<-->N
These patterns evolve through listening , playing , and singing .<-->N
Neuroscientist Frances Rauscher -LRB- 1997 -RRB- of the University of Wisconsin , Oshkosh , completed studies involving a childs spatial intelligence .<-->N
The findings indicated that music instruction does indeed have a long term and perhaps permanent effect on spatial intelligence .<-->O
Comparing nineteen pre-school classes with music lessons to fourteen pre school classes without enhanced music programs , Rauscher discovered that the young 29 musicians experienced a forty-six percent boost in spatial IQ , while the students without the music programs experienced only a six percent improvement in spatial IQ .<-->O
Brewer -LRB- 1991 -RRB- brought to life the rhythms of learning .<-->N
Because the voice is in part a human instrument , children are said to be to be aware of sounds in their environment .<-->N
Rhythmic skills are entwined with gross motor skills , and melodic skills are dependent on the musical elements heard through a childs auditory perception .<-->N
While listening to music requires only the passive appreciation of the listener , playing music is an involved activity .<-->O
As a student learns to play music , multiple independent strands of knowledge in two separate tasks are developed .<-->N
These strands are spatial and musical .<-->N
In the discipline of music , these strands become clustered together , making music a discipline that uses both sides of the brain at the same time -LRB- Grandin , 1998 -RRB- .<-->N
Skills involved in playing music include : gross and fine motor skills , listening skills , mathematical skills , interpreting a symbolic language , and social skills .<-->N
Once again , the importance of brain plasticity becomes evident .<-->N
If the synapse connections occur in a multiplicative factor , then music can create a multitude of synapses by playing a simple tune .<-->N
If this statement is true and the compounding effects of the synaptic connections do occur , then the logical conclusion is that playing music is advantageous to learning .<-->O
Wilcox -LRB- 2000 -RRB- concluded that music study over a long period of time changes the brain and contributes to the function of the brain .<-->N
Kantrowitz -LRB- 1997 -RRB- stated that after years of the arts receiving budget cuts , music and art are now making a comeback in public schools .<-->N
Statistics for Bugg Elementary in North Carolina were given as one of twenty-seven schools experimenting with ways to 30 integrate the arts into the basic curriculum in order to improve basic skills .<-->O
This four-year pilot program began in 1995 and was designed to determine if the arts could impact scores in reading and math .<-->N
The result was that attendance was up and behavior programs were down .<-->N
In music , students learn math by studying rhythm , and interpersonal skills are improved through participation in band and orchestra .<-->N
Kantrowitz warned that leaving the arts out of the curriculum could force a cultural caste system , whereby only the rich students will receive music training .<-->O
Morrison -LRB- 2000 -RRB- stated that the 1997 SAT data released from the College Board demonstrated that students who participate in the arts score at a higher level on the SAT than students who do not .<-->N
The improvement increases with years of participation .<-->N
What is interesting about the data from the College Board is that numerical averages typically go down when the groups size increases .<-->N
While music performance records the largest number of test takers , the numerical score remains significantly higher than for the other groups .<-->N
The 1997 data is recorded in Table 2:1 as follows : Table 2 : SAT Averages from The College Board Course Work SAT Takers Verbal Math Acting or Play Production 225,914 545 532 Art History 219,488 519 518 Dance 125,687 514 507 Drama 146,555 534 521 Music History 164,749 539 534 Music Performance 391,505 529 529 Photography or Film 158,085 525 523 31 Studio Art and Design 224,254 525 527 No Fine Arts 190,137 477 492 -LRB- Morrison , 1997 , p. 1 -RRB- .<-->N
The Magic Formula Gardner -LRB- 1999 -RRB- wrote about the best schools in the world .<-->N
He describes the Reggio schools in Italy as ... ample buildings , open , streaming with light ; potted plants and inviting chairs and couches strategically placed , adding color and comfort to the surroundings in each room -LRB- p. 87 -RRB- .<-->O
He continued to describe secluded alcoves and a common space where all could meet .<-->N
He described the atmosphere as respectful .<-->N
Students spend weeks or months in thematic interests .<-->N
The Reggio team is secure in their mode of operation .<-->N
In Japan , continues Gardner , the first priority for primary schools is to ensure that the students are comfortable at school and that they can interact civilly and productively with others .<-->O
In Chinese primary schools , students create ink-and-brush paintings .<-->N
What Gardner describes from other cultures is a sense of calm , a sense of respect , and a value placed on the discipline of creating beauty through visuals , movement , and sound .<-->O
Armstrong -LRB- 1994 -RRB- addressed the impact of students in the classroom who consistently demonstrated strengths in several areas of studies and the resulting impact on the school curriculum .<-->N
Howard Gardner , the creator of the theory of multiple intelligences , believed that it was paramount that educators recognize and nurture the wide variety of intelligence displayed by individuals .<-->O
Gardners theory consists of seven intelligences : linguistic ; logical-mathematical ; spatial ; bodily-kinesthetic ; musical ; 32 interpersonal ; and intrapersonal .<-->N
Individuals possess all of these intelligences , and one , two , or three will be dominate for each person .<-->N
Armstrong states , In most American schools today , programs that concentrate on the neglected intelligence -LRB- musical , spatial , bodily-kinesthetic , interpersonal and intrapersonal -RRB- tend to be considered frill subjects or at least subjects peripheral to the core academic courses -LRB- p. 108 -RRB- .<-->O
Reimer -LRB- 1999 -RRB- stated that if spatial-temporal reasoning is critical for math , science , and reasoning , then music education should be part of the school curriculum for the development of the students brains .<-->O
As with all of the arts , music is first about creating .<-->N
When considering the curriculum , the key factor for the arts is balance .<-->N
Educators should be encouraged to continue to learn about , apply , and promote the benefits of involvement in the arts as a part of the school curriculum .<-->O
Grandin -LRB- 1998 -RRB- stated that there are two types of reasoning : spatial-temporal and language-analytic .<-->N
Both are crutial for thinking , reasoning , and creating .<-->N
Music involves the pattern development concept , the ability to recognize , as well as the spatial-temporal reasoning , the ability to create , maintain , transforem and relate complex images .<-->O
Weinberger -LRB- 1998 -RRB- stated that the brainpower of youth represent the greatest resource of the United States .<-->N
With the whole cerebral cortex active during music performance , even the most basic level of providing music opportunities is important to child development .<-->O
Music promotes social development while enhancing cognitive abilities .<-->N
Music has many 33 benefits including language acquisition and intellectual development .<-->N
Behaviorally , music creates a spirit of involvement and students resulting in rare absenteeism .<-->N
The Role of Gender The gender gap , exhibited in student achievement during the early years of standardized testing , is now becoming narrow .<-->N
According to Francis -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , research of the early years of standardized testing indicated that the sciences were often masculine domain while fine arts were considered feminine domain .<-->N
In short , girls excel in arts , while boys excel in math and science .<-->O
However , Francis cites a change in this trend at the secondary level and credits this change to the National Curriculum Education Act of 1988 .<-->N
The result of the last decade -LRB- 1990s -RRB- is that females have made great strides and are now performing equal to or marginally better than males in the sciences and math .<-->O
This study provides data documenting for both males and females the role of school-sponsored , extra-curricular activities to academic achievement at a private school in north central Texas .<-->N

-LRB- 2010 , 2 -RRB- Extracurricular activities have many positive effects on education .<-->N
The positive effects that extracurricular activities have on students are behavior , better grades , school completion , positive aspects to become successful adults , and a social aspect .<-->O
Extracurricular activities began in the United States in the 19th century .<-->N
At first they were just an additional part to the normal academic schedule for the year .<-->O
Extracurricular activities usually had some practical or vocational interest that was included into the activities .<-->N
The first extracurricular activities that were well known in schools started at Harvard and Yale University .<-->N
They were literacy clubs that consisted of different debate clubs and Greek systems such as fraternities and sororities .<-->N
Students in American schools were the first to initiate athletic clubs .<-->N
-LRB- Casinger , J. 2011 -RRB- These soon became popular and literacy clubs began to decline .<-->N
Around the time of World War I , schools started adding clubs such as journalism , and newspaper .<-->N
-LRB- Casinger , J. 2011 -RRB- Now these clubs have become popular and many public high schools and grade schools have clubs for all interests .<-->O
Today about 1 in 4 students participate in academic clubs .<-->N
-LRB- Miller , Zittleman , 2010 , 189 -RRB- It costs about $ 250 million to establish extracurricular activities in rural and inner city schools .<-->F
-LRB- Girod et al. , 2005 , 64 -RRB- The USDE funds school s extracurricular activities .<-->F
The first effect that extracurricular activities have on education is behavior .<-->F
Students that participate in extracurricular activities have reduced behavior problems .<-->N
In sports , they show discipline in drills , practices , and routines .<-->N
They have a responsibility to perform those tasks correctly , whether it is basketball of football plays , dance routines , or signals in baseball .<-->O
When students perform these things correctly they are rewarded for their good behavior and they take pride in their accomplishments .<-->O
Because of the pride they achieve , they gain better self respect , self esteem , and self confidence .<-->O
Education world states that Participation in school activities , especially athletics , leads to higher self esteem and enhanced status among peers , which some argue is deterrent to antisocial behavior .<-->O
-LRB- Brown , M.D. , 2000 -RRB- The most dangerous time for bad behavior is the time after school and before parents get home , which is usually the time between three o clock and seven o clock .<-->O
-LRB- Holloway , J. H. , 2002 -RRB- This is the time when they are at the most risk at committing violent acts and victimization .<-->O
The ages that usually are involved in poor behavior during this time are between twelve and seventeen years old .<-->N
-LRB- Howie et al. 2010 , 120 -RRB- Between the ages of nine and seventeen are when kids learn to make their own decisions and control their behavior .<-->N
This is a crucial time for students to be in extracurricular activities because they are under supervision , guidance , and they are in engaged and enriched learning experiences .<-->N
They are then better able to resist unsafe behaviors such as drug and alcohol use , gang involvement , and criminal activities .<-->O
Higher grades and positive attitudes towards school is the second effect that extracurricular activities have on students .<-->N
Self esteem can be a predictor of academic performance .<-->N
Students that don t like school won t do as well as the students that do like school because they are not motivated to succeed .<-->O
If students don t like school , it is usually because they do not feel as though they are succeeding or that they can succeed .<-->O
Participation in an after school program that is designed to build self esteem , had positive effects on standards test scores in math and reading , while receiving extended time to complete homework did not have the same positive effects on self esteem or achievements .<-->O
-LRB- Cosden et al. , 2004 , 223 -RRB- Participation in extracurricular activities provides students an opportunity to create a positive and voluntary connection to their school .<-->O
In a study done by the USDE , It was revealed that students who participate in extracurricular activities are three times more likely to have a grade point average of a 3.0 or higher .<-->N
This is higher than students who did not participate in extracurricular activities .<-->N
This is regardless of their previous background or achievement .<-->N
Students that participate in extracurricular activities also showed positive changes in students self confidence , teacher perception , and greater confidence , and then developed positive school related adult attachments .<-->O
Extracurricular activities increases a students connection to school , raises their self esteem , and positive social natures .<-->N
Below is a story from Cosden , Morrison , Gutierrez , and Brown about a girl who improved her grades because of her participation in extracurricular activities .<-->N
Stephanie was a 14-year-old eighth grader .<-->N
Throughout her early school years , her teachers described her as a good student .<-->N
During fourth grade , Stephanie s parents separated and she witnessed a lot of conflict in the home .<-->N
Stephanie s grades began to slip and her teacher commented that Stephanie was preoccupied with the events occurring in her home life .<-->F
In sixth grade her grades continued to plummet .<-->F
In seventh grade , her brother suggested she become involved in sports .<-->F
Stephanie enjoyed basketball , and she became the captain of the seventh-grade basketball team .<-->F
At the same time her grades began to improve .<-->F
When Stephanie was asked what made seventh grade different from sixth grade , she answered , playing basketball and being the team captain .<-->N
She indicated that she plans to continue to play basketball because it has been a positive influence in her life and it gives her an outlet in which to channel some of the negative energy she was experiencing within her home life .<-->O
As a result of her desire to engage in this sport , she made a conscious effort not to let her family life interfere with her schoolwork .<-->O
-LRB- 2004 , 223 -RRB- The third effect that extracurricular activities have on students is school completion .<-->N
The Average drop out rate in the United States is about 10 % .<-->N
-LRB- Casinger , 2011 -RRB- Students who participate in extracurricular activities are less likely to drop out and more likely to have higher academic achievement .<-->O
Those students that are at risk of failure appear to benefit even more from participation in extracurricular activities than those who are normal achievers .<-->O
This is especially important for students who belong to ethnic minorities , students with disabilities , and at risk of dropping out because students in some of these groups have almost a 40 % drop out rate .<-->O
-LRB- Casinger , 2011 -RRB- Engagement in extracurricular activities is linked to decreasing rates of early drop out rates in both boys and girls .<-->N
Sports are one of the biggest extracurricular activities to have effects on students .<-->F
The athletic programs reduce the drop out rate by 40 % .<-->F
-LRB- Holloway , J. H. , 2002 -RRB- There are also laws that are for kids in sports .<-->F
One of the most known laws is the No Pass No Play act .<-->F
Many states use this law .<-->N
This law states that a student that is participating in sports has to have a certain grade point average and they can not flunk more than two classes or they won t be able to participate in the sport .<-->O
This encourages many students to keep up on their grades , which prevents them from failing or dropping out .<-->N
There are also laws that say that students can not participate in sports if they break the law .<-->N
These things include using drugs , drinking alcohol , and tobacco use .<-->N
The fifth way that extracurricular activities have effects on students is because they have positive aspects that students need to become productive students and adults .<-->O
By participating in extracurricular activities students learn lessons in leadership , teamwork , organization , analytical thinking , problem solving , time management , learning to juggle many tasks at once and it allows them to discover their talents .<-->O
When a student decides they want to join an extracurricular activity , they look for one that interests them and one that they like or enjoy .<-->O
When students are in high school or college , this could be the thing that helps them find a career .<-->N
By participating in extracurricular activities , they will find something they enjoy and see how they can use that as a career .<-->N
Participating in certain extracurricular activities having to do with the field that the student is interested in could help them find a job .<-->O
If someone is looking at a resume for a potential employee , and they see they have experience or interest in what they are looking for , they will be more likely to hire that person .<-->O
These students will then have higher career aspirations .<-->O
Certain extracurricular activities also look good on college applications .<-->N
Colleges look to see if students participate in certain things before they are accepted .<-->N
Participation in some of these activities could also help a student get a scholarship for college .<-->N
When students participate in extracurricular activities , especially at a young age , it teaches them about long term commitments .<-->O
If they want to participate in a certain activity , they sign up for a long time .<-->O
Not just for a week or a few days .<-->N
This is good for students to learn because school is a long term commitment , jobs , and other things that they will have to deal with as adults .<-->O
The final effect that extracurricular activities have on students is the social aspect .<-->N
Students that are involved in extracurricular activities meet many new people .<-->F
Each club or sport is different , so students meet different people in all different groups .<-->N
By joining different ones they meet people with the same backgrounds they have and people they share interests with .<-->N
Most times the people that students meet are students that they would never talk to or become friends with on a normal basis .<-->O
In different extracurricular activities students learn about group work , and sometimes they end up having less conformity to gender stereotypes .<-->N
Extracurricular activities are a part of students every day life .<-->N
They play important roles in student s lives .<-->N
They have positive effects on student s lives by improving behavior , school performance , school completion , positive aspects to make successful adults , and social aspects .<-->O
As teachers , we need to be aware of the effects that extracurricular activities have on education .<-->O
The relationship between students participation in school based extracurricular activities and their achievement in physics After school extracurricular activities have long been recognized for contributing many ways to the enhanced school experience as well as to the increased social skills of students .<-->O
Besides creating a school culture and promoting school spirit , extracurricular activities have been found to have a relationship with students academic performance development of responsibility discovering their abilities and interest , self discipline and leadership skills .<-->O
Although , the programs vary drastically from hunting and home work help to sport and music activities , overall , all programs strive to be fun challenging comforting and share similar goals .<-->O
These goals include most importantly education , psychosocial development , recreation and career awareness .<-->O
Program help educate the student by providing them with an environment for proper study or setting aside for their quiet time .<-->O
The way students choose to spend their free time can affect their school performance .<-->N
Reading after school is the activity most predictive of higher student achievement -LRB- Shumow , 2001 -RRB- .<-->N
Reading at home is not less likely to do in today s day in age so after school reading program is entirely beneficial .<-->O
It is not just traditional in class instruction that between the activities that students choose outside their classroom and their academic performance -LRB- Bringing up Girls in science , 2003 -RRB- Stephen and Schaben , -LRB- 2002 -RRB- noted that there is a variation in the result obtained for student who participates in co curricular activities and those who do not .<-->O
Simon -LRB- 2001 -RRB- also revealed that regardless of student background and prior achievement , various parenting , volunteering and home learning activities , extracurricular activities influences a student grade .<-->O
Involvement in a schools extracurricular activity can be an important learning experience for secondary school students as clubs , library and debating club ; young achiever club , organized essay competition and some other clubs often teach the basic concepts and values of the society as a whole .<-->O
At the fore front of school reform , enrichment programs are increasing in number in number due to the importance of basic skills development , calls for academic excellence and standardized testing -LRB- Coltin , 1995 -RRB- .<-->O
These after school hours were encouraged to be spent improving academic skills .<-->N
Some research -LRB- Petit et al. , 1997 -RRB- found that children who participated in some activities after school were rated by their teacher as having better social skills and fewer behavior problems than children who participated either in no activities or more activities each week -LRB- Shumow , 2001 -RRB- .<-->O
Pierce and Vendell -LRB- 1999 -RRB- found that academically at risk children who attended after school programs more frequently than others developed better work habit in their classroom and attended school more often .<-->O
Another goal of extracurricular activities is to provide children with opportunities to realize their leadership potentials .<-->N
Leadership is an extremely important quality for people to have in order to succeed .<-->O
Leadership is learned over time through the involvement with others .<-->N
Extracurricular activities encourage this by providing for them the chance to begin to understand diverse attitudes skills and talents and how to interact effectively with a diversity of people while working towards common goals .<-->O
Further , extracurricular can provide a student with a personal ; sense of belonging and integration with the school , causing feeling of accomplishment consequently there exists a relationship students extra curricular activities and his sense of accomplishment in a physics class specifically in a laboratory class .<-->O
All of these activities appear to have some sort of effect on students academic performance however , the issue of whether they benefit or hinder he students achievement in physics is unknown and that is the purpose of this research .<-->O
The development of extracurricular activities was slow in the beginning with many seeing it simply as a fad that would pass and quickly fade out of style .<-->O
One of the early philosophers behind extra curricular activities was that they should wherever at all possible grow out of curricular activities and return to curricular activities to enrich them -LRB- Miller 1930 -RRB- .<-->O
Eventually people including educators began to see the benefits of extra curricular activities but it took a while to incur them to it .<-->N
Infact before 1900 educators where skeptical of participation in extracurricular activities believing that school students should focus solely on narrowly defined academic outcomes .<-->N
Non academic activities were viewed as been primarily recreational and therefore were viewed as been primarily recreational and therefore were detrimental to academic achievement and consequently were discouraged -LRB- Marsh and Kleitman , 2002 -RRB- .<-->O
Dean and Bear early experts on extracurricular activities said , Extra curricular activities supplement and extend those contacts found in the more formal part of the program of the school day -LRB- Millard , 1930 -RRB- .<-->N
It was not until recently that Educational practitioners and researchers have taken a more positive arguing that extracurricular activities may have positive effects on life skills and may also benefit academic accomplishment -LRB- Marsh and Kleitman , 2002 -RRB- .<-->O
It is obvious that extracurricular activities have an impact on academic performance and education ever since their inception .<-->N
Statement of the problem Over the years the costs and effect of extracurricular activities have generated many studies and numerous debates in their relation to academic performance .<-->N
Parents and school Personnel alike have had controversies on whether a great deal of time and money should be devoted to these activities especially in this time of tight budget .<-->O
They believed that students should focus solely on a narrowly defined traditional in class instruction that impact academic achievement .<-->O
Educationists are interested in the relationship between academic achievement and participation in extra curricular activities implying that these activities do have some sort of influence on how students perform academically -LRB- Stephen and Schaben , 2002 -RRB- .<-->O
Whether or not there is a relationship between students participation in school based extracurricular activities and students performance in physics is yet to be undertaken empirically .<-->N
LITERATURE REVIEW Extracurricular activities are activities performed by students that fall outside the realm of the normal curriculum of the school .<-->N
Also known as enrichment programs they are courses offered by educational facilities to help promote skills and high level of thinking for students .<-->O
The theory of multiple intelligences developed by Gardner in 1993 broadens our view of how humans learn and realize their potential .<-->O
This theory explains how a variety of skills and talents help to strengthen an individual so it is important for students to be exposed to a variety of different activities to explore their interest and capabilities .<-->O
Extracurricular activities such as sports , drama music , scouting , dance and various clubs are an important part of the educational experience of many students .<-->O
Most studies find that children who participate in their activities are more successful academically than those who do not , it is not clear whether this is because the brighter more energetic students are also the ones who participate more in extracurricular activities , or whether the activities themselves boost students academic performance .<-->O
Extracurricular activities offer benefits for a child who is not gifted academically , the chance to excel in the arts or in sports , for example can make a huge difference in self esteem .<-->O
Many extracurricular activities teach real world skills such as journalism , photography or debate which can lead to life long interests even careers Teens and preteens who devote themselves to service project such as food drives , book drives of neighborhood imperilment projects , learn that they can make a difference and contribute to society .<-->O
They also learn team work and leadership skills that may be even important in the long run than some of the academic subject they study .<-->O
Dyson -LRB- 2002 -RRB- revealed that extracurricular activities strengthen the integration of students with severe disabilities as well .<-->O
Many students with disabilities can acquire the skills necessary to participate partially in clubs offering sports , newspaper , student council and social events such as dances .<-->N
These programs give disabled children the opportunity to work with other children disabled like themselves and non-disabled students in a positive environment where everyone can participate in one way or the other .<-->O
Another goal of extracurricular activities is to provide children with opportunities to realize their leadership potential .<-->N
Leadership is an extremely important quality for people to have in order to succeed .<-->O
Leadership is learned over time through the involvement with others .<-->N
Extracurricular activities encourage this by providing for them the chance to begin to understand diverse attitude skills and talents and how to interact effectively with a diversity of people while working toward a common goal -LRB- Karnes and Bean , 1990 -RRB- .<-->O
Furthermore , extracurricular activities provide a student with a personal sense of belonging and integration with the school causing feeling of accomplishment , self worth and high self esteem in adolescent , especially from activities that lead to publicity from their participation .<-->O
By providing a collective outlet where developing adolescent can focus , creates a safe and healthy means of spending after school hours .<-->N
Extracurricular activities also play a role in reducing drug and alcohol use and irresponsible sexual activities in older children would be on their own after school .<-->N
Its not only a matter of keeping the kids busy the self esteem and sense of purpose that children can get from serious involvement in extracurricular activities may help raise them a reason to say no to risky behaviors .<-->O
Generally leisure is an important adolescent development in that it provides opportunities for youth to select and manage their own experiences by exerting personal control over their environment and becoming autonomous in their action .<-->N
These activities foster the development of cooperation and establish important social negotiation skills within the peer group -LRB- Rombokas 1995 -RRB- .<-->N
Is thus allows adolescent important opportunities for both differentiation and integration .<-->N
The relative control adolescent exert over activity settings allows greater freedom to experiment with social roles behavior and Adeyemo 113 ideas than many other developmental tents .<-->N
School based activities are those activities that are organized and administered by the school under the supervision of staff and other personnel s .<-->N
These kinds of activities include recreational activities sports , school clubs , skills and interests such as arts and crafts , dance , music and more .<-->O
Depending on the school district , there is usually a wide variety offered .<-->N
These school based activities provide adolescent with highly structured leisure environment in which adolescent can exert control and express their identity through choice of activity and actions within the setting , but which do not normally facilitate experimentation with roles and activities that are not sanctioned by adults .<-->N
Some researchers characterize highly structured activities as including regular participation schedules , rule guided engagement , direction by one or more adult activity leaders , an emphasis on skill development that is continually increasing in complexity and challenge activity performance that requires sustained active attention and clear performance that requires sustained active attention and clear performance feedback .<-->O
Generally , the school based activities are important because they take place in the school setting therefore are guided by staff playing a major role in the effect of academic achievement on the students .<-->O
Pierce et al. -LRB- 1999 -RRB- have found that classroom teachers reported that students had fewer behavior problems when staffs were more positive with the children in thereafter school activities .<-->N
According to the type of school based activities the child participates in usually determines how much better they will do in that subject area in school .<-->O
Reading after school is the activity most predictive of higher students achievement .<-->N
Reading at home is a lot less like for children to do in today s day on age so after school activities are extremely beneficial .<-->O
By far , high school students represent the largest group whose extracurricular activities are studied intimately and this research has tended to focus on athletic participation .<-->N
Sillier and Quirk -LRB- 1999 -RRB- looked at high school students extracurricular involvement and academic performance .<-->N
Specifically they studied 123 high school students who participated in interscholastic soccer during the first quarter of the school year and were not involved in any other major extracurricular activity during the second quarter .<-->N
The result indicated that during the soccer -LRB- the first quarter -RRB- , soccer players had higher GPAS that out of season the second quarter .<-->N
Attendance was also better in season but this fatter finding was not statistically significant .<-->O
In a more recent study Broh -LRB- 2002 -RRB- also looked at the relationship between athletics and students outcomes .<-->N
She analyzed data on students from the National Educational Longitudinal study of 1988 -LRB- NELS 88 -RRB- including the first and second follow ups .<-->N
Result of her analysis showed that participating interscholastic sport was related to improved mathematical graders , English and Mathematics test scores , even after controlling for the selection of higher performing students .<-->N
Participation in interscholastic sports was also related to increased self esteem , a more internalized locus of control , spending more time on home work and increased contact among parents , students and teachers .<-->N
Some researchers have looked beyond athletics to other extracurricular activities .<-->N
March -LRB- 1999 -RRB- conducted one of the first large-scale studies on extracurricular activities using the High School and beyond data base , including the first and second follow-up -LRB- National centre for Education statistics -RRB- .<-->F
He examined the relationship between total number of extra circular activities and a variety of outcomes variables in a weighted sample of more than 4000 students .<-->N
Controlling for background variables and sophomore outcomes , March reported that in seines year extracurricular activities was positively associated with social self concept , academic self concept taking advanced courses , time spent on homework , post secondary education aspiration , GPA , parental involvement and lower absenteeism for students across a variety of backgrounds .<-->O
Marsh noted that the relationship with academic and social self concepts but argued that participation in extracurricular activities was important because it can lead to increased commitment to school and school values which lead indirectly to increased academic success .<-->O
Eccles and Barber -LRB- 2000 -RRB- looked at the risks and benefits of five different types of activities pre socially activities , team sports , school involvement , performing arts and academic clubs .<-->N
They analyzed data on 1,259 students when participated in the Michigan study of adolescent life transform from 1983 when they were in the sixth grade through 1997 .<-->N
Academic achievement was measured using 10 = 12th grade GPA and subscale scores from the differential aptitude test .<-->N
The result of the longitudinal regression analysis showed that participation in any of the five types of activities studied resulted in a better than predicted 12th grade GPA .<-->O
They also found that students who participated in sports , performing arts and school involvement activities reported liking school more over the years studied , which is consisted with Marshs -LRB- 1999 -RRB- hypothesis about the effect of extracurricular activities on students commitment to school .<-->N
Broh -LRB- 2002 -RRB- also reported that the differential effects of extracurricular activities were not limited to interscholastic and intramural sports .<-->N
She found that participation in music groups was positively related to both Math and English grades and Math test scores participation in student council was positively related to both sets of grades and participation in year book .<-->O
Rombokas -LRB- 1995 -RRB- investigated the relationship between students involvement in extracurricular activities and their academic performance .<-->N
She opined that students who involved in extracurricular activities received higher grades than those not involved in activities .<-->N
She studied this topic because high school budgets are meager and administrations of these schools want to spend the money efficiently .<-->O
Consequently , funding for extracurricular may be decreased examined the correlation between extracurricular activities and academic performance .<-->N
The scopes of her investigation included high school students and the relationship between their involvement in activities and their academic performance .<-->N
Some collegiate level studies were used since the benefits of extracurricular activities in high school and college are the same .<-->N
She performed a study of college aged students who were involved in extracurricular activities on high school to discover if there was infact a correlation between involvement in activities and academic achievement .<-->N
She concluded after questioning two hundred and ninety two -LRB- 292 -RRB- college students that participation in extracurricular activities enhances both the intellectual and social development of students through her own research she discovered that athletes attain higher grade point averages than those students not in activities .<-->N
In addition , Rombokas found that a national surrey performed by Durbin in 1999 showed that participants in extracurricular activities in high school received better grades when they were not participating in activities .<-->O
Purpose of the study The purpose of this study is to determine the extent of the relationship between students participation in school based extra-curricular activities and their achievement in physics .<-->N
METHODOLOGY Research hypothesis The following hypotheses were postulated to guide the investigation .<-->N
H01 : Extracurricular activities have no effect on students achievement in physics .<-->N
H02 : Students achievement in physics is not influenced by their participation in specific extracurricular activities .<-->N
H03 : Students achievement in physics is not influenced by their involvement in social activities Methods The study adopted a simple survey design and was directed at the population of senior secondary school physics students in Lagos state .<-->N
The sample selection was limited to senior secondary III that is -LRB- SSIII -RRB- physics student .<-->N
Fifty students each were drafted from four randomly selected secondary schools across Lagos State .<-->N
The number of female students selected equals the male to eliminate or Minimize gender biases in the responses .<-->N
In all , two hundred students formed the study sample .<-->N
Instruments The instruments used were questionnaires and physics student achievement test .<-->F
The questionnaire consists of three sections -LRB- A , B , and C -RRB- .<-->F
Section A was designed to elicit information on the biodata of the students .<-->N
Section B includes question on the extra curricular activities that students participate in the school , their favorite type of extracurricular activities and maximum time spent each week on extra curricular activities .<-->N
Section C was provided with 5 responses each borrowing the idea of Likert -LRB- 1932 -RRB- to give room for freedom of expression of the respondents .<-->O
The number of respondents giving each type of response were counted and scored .<-->N
The five responses used are : Strongly agree -LRB- SA -RRB- , Agree -LRB- A -RRB- , Undecided -LRB- U -RRB- , Disagreed -LRB- D -RRB- , and strongly disagreed -LRB- SD -RRB- .<-->N
Finally , the second instrument administered to the students , which is the physics student Achievement Test -LRB- PAT -RRB- , was designed to collect information about the performance of students in physics .<-->N
It comprised 3 essay questions according to the syllabus of the respective classes .<-->N
Each question carried a total mark of ten -LRB- 10 -RRB- thus the overall mark was 30 .<-->N
Data analysis The data analysis and results are presented with special reference to the research hypotheses .<-->N
Table 1 shows the multiple regression analysis of students involvement in extracurricular activities on their achievement in physics .<-->N
From the aforementioned table , it is easy to see that there exists an effect of students involvement in extra curricular activities on their achievement in physics .<-->N
This implies that students involvement in extracurricular activities determines to a greater extent academic performance in physics .<-->N
The relationship is very high , positive and significance at 10 % level of significance .<-->O
Hence the null hypothesis is duly rejected .<-->N
Further , it is necessary to find out if students participation in class influences their academic performance in physics or not .<-->N
To accomplish this , we used hypothesis two .<-->N
Table 2 reveals clearly that students participation in specific extracurricular activities influences their achievement in physics .<-->O
The implication of this finding is that participation in specific extracurricular activities plays a significant role in booting students achievement in physics .<-->O
The relationship is high , positive and significant at 3 % level of significance .<-->O
Hence , the null hypothesis is thereby rejected .<-->N
Furthermore , we establish if students involvement in social activities influences their academic performance in physics or not .<-->N
Table 3 reveals clearly that there exists a significant relationship between involvement in social activities and students achievement in physics .<-->O
The implication of this finding is that involvement in social activities plays a significant role in improving students achievement in physics .<-->O
The relationship is high , positive and significant at 1 % level of significance .<-->O
Hence , the null hypothesis is rejected .<-->N
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The result of the analysis of data shows that students participation in extracurricular activities influences their achievement in physics and this of course shows that generally students non participation in any of these activities account for the students poor achievement .<-->O
This finding corroborate with the views of Marsh and Adeyemo 115 Kleitiman -LRB- 2002 -RRB- that students who participate in extracurricular activities did better academically than students who did not participate .<-->O
Broh -LRB- 2002 -RRB- revealed that students participation in extracurricular activities in general is associated with an improved grade point average , higher education aspiration increased attendance and reduced absenteeism , Darling et al. -LRB- 2005 -RRB- supported the view of Broh that reported higher grades more positive attitude towards school and higher academic aspiration .<-->O
Extracurricular activities serve a large purpose in the academic , social , physical and cognitive development of students which is required in learning physics so every child should have the opportunity to participate in at least one activity that suits his or her personal interest .<-->O
The hypothesis two in this study sought to test the significant effect of students participation in specific extracurricular activities incur great influence on their achievement in physics .<-->O
The result also corroborates Broh -LRB- 2002 -RRB- report that participation in some activities others diminishes academic achievement .<-->N
Marsh and Kleitman -LRB- 2002 -RRB- cited that extracurricular activities have proven to be beneficial in building and strengthening academic achievement , even if the activities are not obviously related to academic subjects .<-->O
Note only does extracurricular activities enhance students achievement in physics but also the type of activity the child participates in .<-->N
These activities however , should be well supervised , timed properly and directed toward improving their development and should involve some mental and physical ability which is required in achievement in physics .<-->O
Students need to be aware of the specific extracurricular activities available to them and the effect that each specific activity has on their academic performance .<-->O
Not every student will benefit from or be impaired in the same manner that studies revealed concerning extracurricular activities .<-->O
Parents need to give their children some freedom in determining which activities to participate in but still need to monitor how their children spend their time .<-->O
Parents have a large role in the academic development of their children and one way of fostering strong academic performance is by encouraging their young children to become involved in some of the activities which promote academic performance .<-->O
This could influence their activity of choices later on in life and may set the foundation for a life of academic success and progress .<-->O
The research result obtained from the data analysis indicated that students involvement in social activities influences their achievement in physics .<-->N
This is supported by the view of Eccles and barber -LRB- 1999 -RRB- that students who participated in social activities and school involvement reported liking school more over the years studied , which is consistent with Marshs -LRB- 1999 -RRB- hypothesis about the effect of social activities on students .<-->O
Although , social aspects of a student s life do not directly affect his or her grade point average they do affect the overall well-being of the student .<-->O
Education is not solely learned by reading the textbook for student can learn an incredible amount from their peers through social activities students learn how to compromise and work in a group which enhances achievement especially in physics .<-->O
Social activities also allow students to meet and interact with peers that may not be within their close group of friends .<-->O
In addition these activities help to enhance these social skills and teach lessons not learned in a classroom .<-->O
Bestler -LRB- 2005 -RRB- said that social activities are an effective way to network and meet other people with whom the students can study .<-->N
Reinforcing Bestler statement Fowkes -LRB- 2005 -RRB- commented that social activities teach students to work in teams and work cooperatively , skills that will help students to be successful in physics and other subjects and also , attain jobs in future .<-->O
This study has shown that students participation in school based extracurricular activities is an important factor to students achievement in physics .<-->N
However , there are implications of the study for students and teachers and the society as a whole .<-->N
The students would perform better if extracurricular activities are encouraged in schools as it would improve physics students reading habit and thinking abilities .<-->O
As it is often said All work and no play makes jack a dull boy , extra curricular activities would make the students more active in class and build up their skills which are important factors in achievement in physics .<-->O
This study will also help teachers spend more time with the student , having a personal relationship with each student , knowing their strengths and their weakness and building up on them thereby improving the physics teachers quality in terms of teaching effectiveness .<-->O
Physics teachers need to undergo further training to update their skills in teaching effectively .<-->O
During training , importance of extracurricular activities to the students should be highly emphasized .<-->N
School administrators should create necessary time during school hours for extracurricular activities and ensure that it is done effectively .<-->O
Government should provide adequate infrastructure and enabling environment for extracurricular activities .<-->N
The Government and private organization should also sponsor these activities thereby giving out prizes and scholarship to motivate the students .<-->N
From the findings and discussions it was drawn that there is a significant relationship between students participation in school based extracurricular activities and their achievement in physics .<-->N
Hence , administration of schools ought to continue their funding of extracurricular activities since it clearly benefits the students academic achievement in physics .<-->O
Schools should encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities since they benefit the students in so many ways .<-->O
Also the schools should educate the coaches and group sponsors on the influence that extracurricular activities have on students live .<-->O
Activities are not solely about what the score is , how many wins or losses are attained or what place is won at a competition .<-->N
They provide and instruct students lessons that will last them a lifetime .<-->N
Over the past century , extracurricular participation has progressively played a greater role in schools and in individual students lives -LRB- Knox , 2007 -RRB- .<-->N
Research supports that extracurricular activities create positive benefits in educational outcomes such as better school attendance , low rates of discipline issues , higher academic achievement , and greater sense of school loyalty or spirit .<-->O
Research also supports that students participating in extracurricular activities were more likely to be in college preparatory programs , achieve higher grades , and desire to enroll in and graduate from college -LRB- Videon , 2002 -RRB- .<-->O
However , not all research supported uniform results between extracurricular participation and academic success .<-->N
Adler and Adler -LRB- 1985 -RRB- found a weak positive relationship between academic achievement and athletic participation .<-->O
A negative relationship was found between the two studies .<-->N
This relationship is attributed to the lack of preparation for , and interest in , academics by athletes which has resulted in athletes having lower GPA s , lower persistence to graduation and lower chances of graduating -LRB- Adler & Adler , 1985 ; Maloney & McCormick , 1993 ; Miller , 2009 -RRB- .<-->O
Poor academic development of athletes have warranted reform among intercollegiate athletes -LRB- Ferris , Finster & McDonald , 2004 -RRB- .<-->N
A significant negative gap emerged between the academic performance and graduation rate of African-American athletes and their Caucasian peers -LRB- Matthews & Ofobike , 2006 ; Sander , 2007 -RRB- .<-->N
These gaps were more pronounced in Division I sports of men s basketball and football where more African 2 American tend to participate in more frequently -LRB- Matthews & Ofobike ; Sander ; Miller , 2009 -RRB- .<-->N
Taras -LRB- 2005 -RRB- reviewed studies on the effects of physical activity on younger students and the relationship to academic performance .<-->N
It was determined that some short-term improvements were related to physical activity , with respect to concentration , but there was no well substantiated long-term academic achievement as a result of more vigorous physical activity -LRB- Taras -RRB- .<-->O
Arguments from both views have sparked interest and concern from parents to school administrators .<-->O
Educating students has primarily been the goal of institutions of learning .<-->N
However , the pressure of winning and the attainment of fame and fortune , in sports , has created debate in the role of the school .<-->O
In a study titled the Well Rounded Student , Black -LRB- 2002 -RRB- acknowledged extracurricular participation and academic achievement are directly linked .<-->N
Participating in extracurricular activities promotes commitment from the student and that same commitment carries over to their role as a student .<-->N
Brown -LRB- 1999 -RRB- also supported that a developmental process takes place in the connection of activity participation and school .<-->N
Further support for the attachment theory is found in Crosnoe s -LRB- 2002 -RRB- study which recognized that higher levels of academic achievement by student-athletes are a result of their advanced rate of adaptation to the school environment .<-->O
Youth receiving additional physical activity tend to show improved attributes such as increased brain function and nourishment , higher energy/concentration levels , changes in body build affecting self esteem , and better behavior which may all support cognitive learning -LRB- Cocke , 2002 -RRB- .<-->O
3 Studies also indicate that music instruction has a positive effect on academic achievement -LRB- Friedman , 1993 -RRB- .<-->N
Higher reading and math scores were found for those students who spent time on music instruction regularly -LRB- Trent , 1997 -RRB- .<-->N
Along with the development of cognitive learning through a variety of extracurricular activities , additional benefits were recognized through the research .<-->N
In 1997 , Eppright , Sanfacon , Beck , and Bradley investigated the importance of extracurricular participation in relation to childhood and adolescent development .<-->N
The study stated that participation in extracurricular activities ?<-->F
encourages the development of leadership skills , self-esteem , muscle development , and overall physical health ?<-->F
-LRB- Eppright et al. , p. 71 -RRB- .<-->N
Research by Haensly , Lupkouski , and Ellind -LRB- 1986 -RRB- also found a positive relationship between participation in extracurricular activities and academic achievement .<-->N
Moreover , extracurricular activities provided a context for the development of positive social characteristics .<-->N
Beside the many social advantages of extracurricular participation administrators , parents , and community members have also acknowledged that athletics play an important role in a child s life experience .<-->N
In the 1996 Gallup survey parents were asked if they would prefer their oldest child to be ?<-->N
a straight A student ?<-->N
or to be ?<-->F
an average student who is involved in sports and extracurricular activities ? .<-->F
Only 29 % chose to be ?<-->F
a straight = A student ?<-->F
while 60 % of parents chose the latter -LRB- Phi Delta Kappan/Gallup Poll , 1996 -RRB- .<-->N
These parents viewed social involvement and acceptance as an integral part of adolescence .<-->N
4 Researchers have indicated that participation in extracurricular activities , such as athletics , minimizes delinquency -LRB- Landers & Landers , 1978 -RRB- , mitigates dropouts -LRB- McNeal , 1999 -RRB- , and has a positive effect on student achievement -LRB- Otto & Alwin , 1977 -RRB- .<-->O
This positive impact has been a justification for the spending of a great deal of time and public money by school districts , students , and communities .<-->O
Mahoney -LRB- 2000 -RRB- found that students were less likely to be arrested if more than half the social group in which they chose to ?<-->N
hang out ?<-->N
participated in extracurricular activities .<-->N
Activities that lack structure and skill-building techniques tend to attract high-risk adolescents resulting in an environment conducive to the development of problem behavior -LRB- Mahoney , Stattin , & Lord , 2004 -RRB- .<-->O
Thus , extracurricular activities can facilitate adolescents developmental need for social relatedness and can contribute to a students identity as an important and valued member of the school community -LRB- Eccles & Barber , 1999 -RRB- .<-->O
The impact of extracurricular activities on students adolescent development and academic achievement is as relevant and important today as it has been in the past . ?<-->O
Some adolescents are perfectly capable of ordering their various affairs that , with apparently no effort , they can be football captains , distinguished amateur artists , or social leaders and still maintain a = gentleman s average ?<-->O
-LRB- Thom , 1932 , p. 159 -RRB- .<-->N
The fundamental rationale for schools to encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities continues to be the development of the full potential of each student -LRB- Marsh & Kleitman , 2002 -RRB- .<-->O
5 Background of the Study The debate has ensued on whether extracurricular activities help or hinder student academic progress .<-->O
Mahoney , Cairns , and Farmer -LRB- 2003 -RRB- suggested that extracurricular activities can have a positive impact on academic achievement , educational status , and social development among students .<-->O
The relationship between high school extracurricular participation and academic achievement is one of the most debated topics in schools and districts .<-->O
Research has focused on the grade point average -LRB- GPA -RRB- as a tool in presenting the relationship between athletic participation and academic success -LRB- Sitkowski , 2008 ; Watkins , 2004 ; Stencil , 2005 -RRB- .<-->N
However , concern arises from the inconsistency of methods in determining academic viability with only one source , such as GPA -LRB- Moriana , et .<-->O
al. , 2006 -RRB- .<-->N
Local sites and teachers create criteria and standards for the GPA .<-->F
Whereas , standards for Adequate Yearly Progress -LRB- AYP -RRB- are determined by a consistent national criteria and grading system .<-->N
Adequate Yearly Progress is used to determine if schools are successful in educating their students .<-->N
The No Child Left Behind Act requires states to use a single accountability system to determine whether all students , as well as individual subgroups are making progress toward meeting state academic standards -LRB- Department of Education , 2001 -RRB- .<-->N
It is expected that all public schools will meet proficient standards by the year 2014 .<-->O
6 Statement of the Problem In the midst of an economic downturn , school districts nationwide are making difficult decisions to reduce or eliminate extracurricular programs .<-->N
Research has consistently touted the benefits of participating in extracurricular activities , however , cash-strapped schools are in survival mode with budget cuts and are questioning the necessity of after-school activities .<-->O
In an environment of attaining academic standards , extracurricular activities are being scrutinized in terms of cost effectiveness -LRB- Schreiber & Chambers , 2002 -RRB- .<-->N
Recently , a Gallup survey asked the question , ?<-->N
What do you think are the biggest problems that the public schools of your community have to deal with ??<-->O
A third of those polled claimed lack of funding to be the biggest issue -LRB- Phi Delta Kappan/Gallup Poll , 2009 -RRB- .<-->N
School administrators , who depend on taxes , are experiencing unprecedented shortfalls in their budgets .<-->N
To compensate , some school boards have terminated employees , cut back on transportation , and reduced or eliminated extracurricular programs -LRB- Sinha , 2010 -RRB- .<-->O
Parrino -LRB- 2003 -RRB- states as many school districts that look for ways to reduce expenditures many systems are considering the benefits of eliminating extracurricular activities or rescheduling them throughout the day .<-->N
As with other options , such cuts have potential disadvantages , especially in terms of morale .<-->O
Roth -LRB- 2003 -RRB- explored the in-depth funding crises that schools are currently facing and their effects on curriculum .<-->N
From a cost standpoint , activity programs are an exceptional bargain when matched against school districts overall budget .<-->O
The National Federation of High Schools determined through collected data from across the country 7 that activity programs make up only 1-3 % percent of the overall education budget in a school -LRB- NFHS , 2010 -RRB- .<-->N
Extracurricular activities are the prime targets for elimination when education budgets become strained -LRB- Watkins , 2004 -RRB- .<-->O
In general , extracurricular activities are considered extra or secondary to the goal of academic achievement .<-->N
Purpose of the Study The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of participation in extracurricular activities to academic progress .<-->N
Participants in extracurricular activities have been held to a higher standard of academic performance through eligibility requirements than students who do not participate in extracurricular activities .<-->N
For instance , under many state athletic association rules , athletes are required to maintain a 2.0 GPA before and during an athletic season .<-->N
This requirement also stands true for those who participate in other extracurricular events such as marching band , choir , and orchestra .<-->O
The majority of researched studies used the GPA as an indicator for academic success -LRB- Sitkowski , 2008 ; Watkins , 2004 ; Stencil , 2005 -RRB- .<-->N
However , the GPA from teacher to teacher and school to school is ill-defined .<-->N
In comparing college GPA to the national standard Graduate Record Examination -LRB- GRE -RRB- , Anaya -LRB- 1999 -RRB- found that although comparable results occurred , in general , both measured a different aspect of student learning .<-->N
The Utah Criterion Reference Test scores illustrate a national standardized test that all 10th graders are subject to take .<-->N
The purpose of this study was to link the impact of 8 extracurricular activities to grade point average scores and the Utah Criterion Reference Test scaled scores in Math , English , and Science to validate academic success .<-->N
Research Questions The review of literature strongly suggested that there is a direct correlation between extracurricular activities and academic achievement .<-->N
For this research , only high school 10th graders were selected from a suburban district with five high schools .<-->N
Tenth graders were selected because of the comparison data of Math , English , and Science scores with Grade Point Averages and the Utah Criterion Reference Test scaled scores .<-->N
Cumulative GPA scores were used with end of year Utah Criterion Reference Test scaled scores .<-->F
Therefore , the following questions were generated : 1 .<-->N
Is there a significant difference between extracurricular participation and the educational performance of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants as measure by their cumulative average daily attendance ?<-->O
Is there a significant difference between extracurricular participation and the educational performance of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants as measured by their cumulative grade point average ?<-->O
Is there a significant difference between extracurricular participation and the educational performance of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants as measured by their Utah Criterion Reference Test scaled scores in math , English , and science ?<-->O
9 4 .<-->N
Is there a significant difference between the cumulative grade point average and the Utah Criterion Reference Test scaled scores in math , English , and science of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants ?<-->O
Null Hypotheses To determine statistical probability within a quantitative study , null and alternative hypotheses that correspond with the research questions and objectives of the study were needed .<-->N
The null and alternative hypotheses of this study were determined to be the following : 1 .<-->N
There is no significant difference between extracurricular participation and the educational performance of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants as measured by their cumulative average daily attendance ?<-->O
There is no significant difference between extracurricular participation and the educational performance of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants as measured by their cumulative grade point average ?<-->O
There is no significant difference between extracurricular participation and the educational performance of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants as measured by their Utah Criterion Reference Test scaled scores in math , English , and science ?<-->O
There is no significant difference between the cumulative Grade Point Average and the Utah Criterion Reference Test Scaled scores in math , English , and science of high school 10th grade extracurricular participants and non-participants ?<-->O
10 Limitation and Delimitations The data used here pose some limitations to the research conducted .<-->N
This study used the data of 10th grade students from five high schools in a suburban school district in central Utah .<-->N
The sample size may limit the generalizability of the results to the general population of high school students throughout the United States .<-->N
The findings of this study may limit the generalization of the findings to students enrolled in public high schools and not secondary private and charter schools .<-->N
The study may be limited by certain uncontrolled differences which may exist between high school extracurricular students and non-extracurricular students identified in this study .<-->O
Factors such as the income , education of parents , single parent households , etc. , though not investigated , may limit generalization .<-->O
This study is strictly a data collection study with no attitudinal or longitudinal measurements .<-->N
A basic data collection was used to simply identify each student for the study .<-->N
Consideration was not given to the students attitudes toward their respective sport , classes , coaches , teachers , or school .<-->N
The data collected in this study was cumulative and not tracked over time .<-->N
Improvement or a decrease in academic achievement did not play a part in the statistical analysis in the study .<-->N
Each school computes the number of days absent differently than other schools .<-->N
Attendance is monitored by the teacher and each one places a value on whether a student is absent or not .<-->F
The same issue surrounds the concept of grading .<-->F
Due to the population within the school district , the conclusions identified in this study may apply only to similarly diverse populations .<-->N
NON-FORMAL EDUCATION AS A MEANS TO MEET LEARNING NEEDS OF OUT-OF-SCHOOL CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS It is increasingly recognised that school alone can not provide quality basic education for all .<-->N
The global progress made towards Education for All -LRB- EFA -RRB- since the World Education Forum in 2000 has arguably been significant , particularly with regard to enrolment and gender parity at primary level .<-->O
Yet , there were more than 57 million out-of-school children of primary age worldwide in 20111 .<-->N
At least another 69 million young adolescents were not attending primary or secondary school , due to the multiple and often inter-connected disadvantages they face , such as poverty , rural location , gender bias , disability and social discrimination .<-->O
Moreover , the current structure of formal education in many countries is in itself excludes specific groups of children .<-->N
To uphold the right to education of those who are not enrolled in schools , diverse forms of provision through different learning pathways are required .<-->O
Non-formal education is one such pathway .<-->N
Characterised by a high degree of flexibility and openness to change and innovation in its organisation , pedagogy and delivery modes , nonformal education caters to diverse and context-specific learning needs of children , young people and adults worldwide .<-->O
It thereby involves a wide range of stakeholders , including educational establishments , the private sector , non-governmental organisations and public institutions -LRB- UNICEF/UIS , 2014 -RRB- .<-->N
Non-formal education has been evolved over past decades and regained currency in recent years in light of changing educational and developmental landscapes -LRB- Council of Europe , 2003 ; Rogers , 2004 ; Hoppers , 2006 , 2007b ; Rose , 2009 ; UNESCO Bangkok , 2012 ; UNESCO and UNICEF , 2013 -RRB- .<-->N
The notion , if not its practice , of non-formal education emerged in the global education discourse in the late 1960s , out of a recognition that formal education was in a state of disarray -LRB- Coombs , 1968 -RRB- .<-->O
The concept of lifelong learning put forward by the Faure Report -LRB- UNESCO , 1972 -RRB- expanded the understanding of traditional education which until then had been limited to formal schooling .<-->O
Since the early 1970s , many typologies of education or learning have assumed three forms of education , of which non-formal education is one , together with formal and informal education -LRB- Coombs & Ahmed , 1973 ; European Commission , 2001 ; UIS , 2012 -RRB- .<-->N
A massive outburst of interest emerged regarding non-formal education during the 1970s and the 1980s -LRB- King , 1982 ; Rogers , 2004 -RRB- .<-->O
However , this has significantly diminished since the late 1980s , when the international community increased its focus on schooling as a dominant means of learning .<-->N
In parallel , less positive characteristics of non-formal education have been highlighted .<-->N
Non-formal education tends to comprise small-scale , short-term programmes with limited funding , which sometimes limit its impact and sustainability and raise the question of quality and effectiveness .<-->O
Non-formal programmes may not always be aligned with broader national education and development policies , or demands from the world of work , and quite often they do not induce learners to continue their education formally .<-->N
Thus , non-formal education tends to be perceived as somewhat inferior to formal education .<-->N
In today s increasingly inter-connected , globalised , and technologically advanced societies within which lifelong learning takes place , internationally agreed goals , notably the EFA goals and the Millennium Development Goals -LRB- MDGs -RRB- , have provided new contexts for non-formal education .<-->O
Non-formal education has become a policy focus of the international community , due mainly to the following recognition .<-->N
1 UNESCO Institute for Statistics -LRB- UIS -RRB- , 2013 .<-->N
- 5 - Multiple types of non-formal education exist which can be adapted for specific learning needs of individuals and populations in different conditions .<-->O
Particularly , in the context of achieving the EFA goals and the MDGs , non-formal education s elastic , and contextspecific approaches are appropriate and useful in fulfilling the right to education of the marginalised and those populations with special learning needs .<-->O
While schooling remains an important means for providing basic education , non-formal education can reach learners who lack access to formal education or can not complete full cycle of basic education .<-->O
Along with formal and informal learning , non-formal education constitutes an integral part of lifelong learning towards which many countries are shifting their policy focuses .<-->O
This recognition has been accompanied by national efforts to explore potential roles of nonformal education in their education systems and the way in which non-formal education can be related to formal education .<-->N
The innovative nature of non-formal education to develop human capabilities , improve social cohesion and to create responsible future citizens has increasingly been recognised .<-->O
With reforms to improve school curricula taking place across the world , nonformal education has proven to be effective for critical pedagogy and innovative approaches , going beyond the two pillars of learning , learning to know and learning to do , that used to be the main focus of formal education in the past , to also include the other two pillars - learning to be and learning to live together -LRB- Delors , 1996 -RRB- .<-->O
There have emerged heightened individual and societal expectations of the positive impact of non-formal education on economic productivity .<-->N
Providing learning opportunities for those who partially or completely missed formal basic education could potentially lead to higher social productivity and thus greater economic growth .<-->O
It is in this context that this paper intends to explore the potential of non-formal education to meet learning needs of out-of-school children and adolescents , based on country and regional reports produced by the UNICEF-UIS Global Initiative on Out-of-School Children -LRB- UNICEF and UIS , 2010 -RRB- and other existing literature2 .<-->O
The evolving concept of non-formal education : A concept and a type of non-formal education treated by this paper Understanding what constitutes non-formal education is an important first step for managing policies and programmes as well as national education systems .<-->N
Currently , there is no single universally accepted definition of non-formal education -LRB- Hoppers , 2006 ; Rogers , 2004 ; Romi and Schmida , 2009 -RRB- .<-->N
Instead , many existing definitions simply contrast it with formal education , adopting the tripartite categorisation of education formal , non-formal and informal education as devised in 1973 -LRB- Coombs and Ahmed -RRB- 3 .<-->N
This categorisation is still widely used for the purposes of planning , administration , financing , monitoring and evaluation .<-->N
2 At the time of preparing this paper , the following UNICEF and UIS country and regional reports -LRB- 2011a ; 2011b ; 2012a ; 2012b ; 2012c ; 2012d ; 2012e ; 2013a ; 2013b ; 2014 -RRB- prepared based on the conceptual and methodological framework -LRB- 2011a -RRB- were available .<-->N
3 Non-formal education is any organised , systematic , educational activity carried out outside the framework of the formal system to provide selected types of learning to particular subgroups in the population , adults as well as children -LRB- Coombs , P.H. ; Ahmed , M , 1973 -RRB- .<-->O
- 6 - Box 1 .<-->N
Evolving concept of non-formal education While the notion of non-formal education based on the 1973 definition by Coombs and Ahmed is still influential in practice , experts and educationalists have conceptualised non-formal education , reflecting changing educational landscapes and understandings of learning .<-->O
Some have moved away from the simple counter-positioning of non-formal and formal education , by which non-formal education tends to be treated as inferior to the latter -LRB- Robinson-Pant , 2014 -RRB- .<-->N
Others claim that boundaries between formal and non-formal education are blurred -LRB- Farrell & Hartwell , 2008 -RRB- .<-->N
Another view point among those who focus on situated learning 4 holds that the tripartite categorisation of education should be abandoned , conceiving formality and informality as attributes present in all circumstances of learning -LRB- Colley , Hodkinson , and Malcolm , 2003 -RRB- .<-->O
There are also those who recognise the breadth and richness of knowledge , skills , attitudes and values acquired outside school , and argue for a perception of learning as a continuum of informal , self-directed , non - formal , and formal learning .<-->O
-LRB- Rogers , 2004 -RRB- .<-->N
Moreover , the terminology complicates the matter further .<-->N
To express non-formal education or a form of it , different terms are used , such as flexible learning , alternative learning , complementary learning , supplementary education , second chance education and extracurricular activities .<-->O
Due to the concept s vagueness , some even advocate using descriptions of each framework , rather than attempting to arrive at a common definition -LRB- Bhola , 1983 -RRB- .<-->O
While registering debates about the evolving concept , this paper will adopt a recent definition of non-formal education as indicated in the box below .<-->N
This definition is contained in the 2011 International Standard Classification of Education -LRB- UIS , 2012 -RRB- developed to facilitate comparisons of educational statistics and indicators across countries .<-->N
The 2011 ISCED definition is similar to the EU definition -LRB- European Commission , 2001 -RRB- which is also in frequent use .<-->N
It is important to note diverse forms of non-formal education as shown by a number of typologies -LRB- Brennan , 1997 ; Hallak , 1990 ; Hoppers , 2006 ; Rogers , 2004 -RRB- .<-->N
Broadly , these fall into the following types , some of which could be combined : 1 -RRB- remedial and supplemental nonformal education to satisfy unfulfilled provision by formal education , targeting school dropouts , out-of-school children and young people and adults who have missed schooling ; 2 -RRB- non-formal education which includes vocational training and a skills development component ; 3 -RRB- experimental and innovative non-formal education , some of which involves greater independence from governments , to respond to emerging learning needs as societies evolve -LRB- e.g. education for sustainable development , education for peace and democracy , citizenship education -RRB- .<-->O
Innovations in curricula and pedagogies generated through this type of non-formal education can be adapted to teaching and learning in formal education .<-->N
It can also challenge traditional concepts of education -LRB- Romi and Schmida , 2009 -RRB- ; and 4 -RRB- others types of non-formal education , including indigenous and traditional education -LRB- Brennan , 2006 -RRB- , religious education , and education programmes for personal development organised by cultural institutions .<-->O
The following section will focus mainly on the first category of non-formal education remedial or supplemental which has gained particular attention worldwide due to increasing concern about the unmet leaning needs of out-of-school children and adolescents .<-->O
4 Situated learning : The notion advanced by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger -LRB- 1991 -RRB- regards learning as a social process whereby knowledge is co-constructed .<-->O
Learning is not the transmission of abstruct and decontextualised knowledge and should be situated in a specific context and embedded within a particular social and physical environment .<-->O
- 7 - Box 2 .<-->N
Definitions of three forms of education by the ISCED 2011 Non-formal education .<-->F
Education that is institutionalised , intentional and planned by an education provider .<-->N
The defining characteristic of non-formal education is that it is an addition , alternative and/or complement to formal education within the process of the lifelong learning of individuals .<-->O
It is often provided to guarantee the right of access to education for all .<-->O
It caters to people of all ages but does not necessarily apply a continuous pathway-structure ; it may be short in duration and/or low-intensity , and it is typically provided in the form of short courses , workshops or seminars .<-->N
Non-formal education mostly leads to qualifications that are not recognised as formal or equivalent to formal qualifications by the relevant national or sub-national education authorities or to no qualifications at all .<-->N
Non-formal education can cover programmes contributing to adult and youth literacy and education for out-of school children , as well as programmes on life skills , work skills , and social or cultural development .<-->N
Formal education : Education that is institutionalised , intentional and planned through public organizations and recognised private bodies and in their totality constitutes the formal education system of a country .<-->N
Formal education programmes are thus recognised as such by the relevant national education authorities or equivalent authorities , e.g. any other institution in cooperation with the national or sub-national education authorities .<-->O
Formal education consists mostly of initial education .<-->N
Vocational education , special needs education and some parts of adult education are often recognised as being part of the formal education system .<-->N
Informal learning : Forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate but are not institutionalised .<-->N
It is consequently less organized and structured than either formal or non-formal education .<-->N
Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family , workplace , local community and daily life , on a self-directed , family-directed or socially-directed basis .<-->N

System-wide approach to non-formal education : Prerequisite for meeting learning needs of out-of-school children and adolescents Effective provision of non-formal education for out-of-school children and adolescents requires a combination of both system-wide and targeted approaches .<-->O
A system-wide approach to non-formal education , linked with broader development frameworks , is an essential condition for sustainable , quality non-formal provision for out-of-school children and adolescents .<-->O
Key areas covered by this approach , some of which will be discussed in detail below , include : 1 -RRB- positioning of non-formal education within national education systems in terms of education governance , management and coordination ; 2 -RRB- data and knowledge bases of non-formal education ; 3 -RRB- relevance and implementation of related legislation and policies ; 4 -RRB- financial resources ; and 5 -RRB- capacities of institutions , professionals and practitioners .<-->O
3.1 Better positioning of non-formal education in national education systems and its governance and management Better positioning of non-formal education within national education systems , governance and management structure is crucial , in particular in the following respects : 1 -RRB- bridging non-formal education and formal education within the education system ; 2 -RRB- promoting inter-sectoral cooperation ; 3 -RRB- strengthening collaboration among different levels of the education systems central government , decentralised authorities , school and communities and 4 -RRB- ensuring adequate provision in fragile states .<-->O
- 8 - Firstly , it is increasingly becoming an area of policy focus to establish an integrated education system , underpinned by a comprehensive approach to learning , encompassing formal nonformal and informal education -LRB- ADEA , 2012 ; Morpeth and Creed , 2012 ; UNICEF , 1993 ; UNICEF and UIS , 2014 -RRB- .<-->O
Being out of school is not a synonym for no learning .<-->N
Out-of-school children and young people may be involved in non-formal education provided by state and nonstate actors in or outside the education sector -LRB- e.g. health programmes , skills training , agricultural extensions -RRB- and may acquire knowledge and skills from parents and peers through informal learning .<-->N
Frequently , however , learning outcomes of non-formal and informal education are not recognized in a way which allows learners to transit into formal school or technical and vocational institutions .<-->N
Such lack of recognition can also limit learners career prospects in the world of work .<-->O
In certain locations therefore , efforts have been made towards more integrated education systems by ensuring equivalence of learning outcomes and developing frameworks for transferable credit .<-->O
The National Institute for Open Schooling , in India , BRAC Primary School in Bangladesh and Escuela Nueva in Colombia are a few examples -LRB- Farrell & Hartwell , 2008 -RRB- .<-->N
Equivalency programmes have been developed elsewhere such as Afghanistan , Burkina Faso , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Honduras , Indonesia , Namibia , Mali , the Philippines , Thailand Uganda and Zambia -LRB- ADEA , 2012 ; Hoppers , 2007a , 2007b ; UNESCO Bangkok , 2006 , 2011 , 2012 ; USAID , 2006 , 2007 -RRB- to bridge formal and non-formal education by linking learning content and developing frameworks to recognise learning outcomes of prior learning .<-->O
Secondly , non-formal education draws its strength from inter-sectoral cooperation supported by appropriate national systems , governance structure and management .<-->O
-LRB- UNICEF and UIS , 2014 -RRB- .<-->N
A rural out-of-school girl , for instance , may require curricular and corresponding learning materials which address her specific learning needs and indigenous knowledge , better aligned to her life context .<-->O
This may require a more nuanced , individualised approach with a multisectoral perspective as oppose to the national-standardised approach .<-->N
At the same time , her family may need social protection through , for instance , cash transfers .<-->O
Education systems alone can not remove barriers obstructing many children from meaningful learning .<-->N
In reality , non-formal education does involve several sectors in countries such as Bangladesh , Brazil , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Namibia and Thailand .<-->N
Effective linkages and coordination among these sectors , however , remains a challenge .<-->N
In Senegal , for instance , no fewer than four ministries coordinated their own non-formal literacy programmes without any oversight by the ministry in charge of the sector -LRB- ADEA , 2012 -RRB- .<-->N
Thirdly , system enhancement and governance reforms are areas deserving of particular attention .<-->O
Some countries have enhanced decentralised national education systems and improved coordination among different levels of these systems .<-->N
To better reflect local needs in policies and interventions , many countries have decentralised education systems by transferring decision-making powers , resources , planning and monitoring functions from the ministries of education to sub-regional and local governments , communities and schools .<-->O
In addition , special departments for non-formal education were also created at the national level , although not all of them are sufficiently resourced .<-->O
In Asia and the Pacific region , many countries lack special unites for non-formal education at provincial or district levels , with some exceptions such as Thailand .<-->O
This presents a challenge , particularly when numerous small-scale activities are implemented at community and local levels .<-->N
In Ethiopia , for instance , 85 programmes of 35 NGOs were concentrated in less difficult areas with no coordination -LRB- Rose , 2009 -RRB- .<-->N
Enhanced decentralised non-formal education systems , therefore , are required not only to ensure better coordination of these community-level activities but also to link those activities with the decentralised education systems for improved coherence in policies and practices .<-->O
- 9 - Lastly , special attention is required concerning non-formal education in unstable and fragile education systems which often exist in countries with political turmoil , and/or natural and manmade disasters .<-->O
While globally the number of out-of-school children decreased by 3 million between 2008 and 2011 , the share of out-of-school children of primary school age in conflictaffected countries increased from 42 % to 50 % -LRB- UNESCO , 2014 -RRB- .<-->N
Under these circumstances , system-wide approaches are needed to ensure effective and coordinated intervention of diverse providers through preparation of a national plan of action at the early reconstruction phase as well as a framework for non-formal education according to the phase of emergency -LRB- UNESCOIIEP , 2006 -RRB- .<-->O
3.2 Data , information and knowledge bases Accurate and adequate data , information and knowledge of non-formal education are indispensable for managing a cycle of policies and programmes -LRB- e.g. identification of key issues , policy and programme design , implementation , monitoring and evaluation -RRB- and demonstrating potential socio-economic impacts of non-formal provision .<-->O
Monitoring of non-formal education , however , is a complex task due to diverging understandings of its meaning and its heterogeneous nature , as well as , its diverse modes of delivery , wide-ranging stakeholders involved and limited financing .<-->O
Despite recent global developments , data and knowledge regarding non-formal education remain relatively weak .<-->N
On the international level , there is no comparable data for non-formal education which is collected in a systematic manner -LRB- e.g. mappings , surveys , censuses -RRB- .<-->N
While recognising nonformal education , the 2011 ISCED -LRB- UIS , 2012 -RRB- states clearly that it does not give specific advice on the development of mappings for non-formal programmes or any related non-formal educational qualifications .<-->O
However , it advances some ideas for improving international statistics , including further development of the concept of non-formal education and the establishment of criteria of content equivalency for the classification of non-formal education programmes and qualification frameworks to facilitate a classification of non-formal programmes by level .<-->O
A positive country-level development is national Education Management Information Systems -LRB- EMIS -RRB- , which have been enhanced in recent years in nearly all developing countries .<-->N
The need for data and information relating to non-formal education is increasingly recognised .<-->O
As a result , most ministries of education in South Asia , for instance , include non-formal education departments which manage related programmes , including data collection .<-->N
While several countries have developed Non-Formal Education Management Information Systems -LRB- NFE-MIS -RRB- in the last decade , an increasing effort has been directed towards developing more comprehensive EMIS which integrates both formal and non-formal education in a number of countries , such as Cambodia , the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania .<-->O
Regarding collection of data on non-formal provision and demands , the lack of a single data source usually derives from the limitation of administrative data which does not always cover non-formal programmes , private and religious education .<-->O
Survey data are useful but they are not always linked with education systems -LRB- UIS and UNICEF , 2011a -RRB- and may omit some population groups -LRB- Carr-Hill , 2012 -RRB- .<-->N
A mix of the main data collection methods for non-formal education described by Carron and Hill -LRB- 1991 -RRB- is still in use today : the directories which are usually under the authority of or in cooperation with the Ministry of Education ; statistical reports ; sector assessments which identify needs for non-formal programmes ; national and international - 10 - household surveys to collect information from participants in non-formal programmes5 ; and research -LRB- e.g. costs , dropout , tracer studies or assessments -RRB- .<-->O
The availability and quality of data on non-formal education , however , are uneven across counties , and methodological challenges remain .<-->N
In addition , little systematic monitoring has been conducted regarding learning outcomes and impacts of non-formal provision for out-of-school children and young people .<-->O
Increasing the visibility of learning outcomes , however , is becoming a policy focus in some locations , not least in European countries where the creation of active citizens who are employable and productive ranks high on policy agendas in the context of lifelong learning -LRB- Bjornavold , 2000 ; Werquin , 2012 -RRB- .<-->O
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- s Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies -LRB- PIAAC -RRB- , for example , assesses literacy and numeracy skills as well as problem-solving skills in technology-rich environments of populations between 16 and 65 years of age -LRB- OECD , 2013 -RRB- .<-->N
Efforts have also been made in a number of countries such as Australia to establish assessments and recognition frameworks in the context of equivalency programmes .<-->O
With their relatively high flexibility and adaptability , small-scale assessments have the potential to improve the understanding of knowledge and skill levels acquired through non-formal learning .<-->O
Such small-scale assessments include the Early Grade Reading Assessment employed in nearly 50 countries6 , Uwezo in Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania7 , and assessments included in a sample-based household survey distributed by Pratham , an Indian NGO8 .<-->N
The OECD is also planning to expand the Programme for International Student Assessment -LRB- PISA -RRB- into low - and middle-income countries -LRB- OECD , PISA for Development -RRB- , which includes assessments of out-of-school 15 year-olds to understand their socio-economic background , schooling history and current situation in addition to their cognitive performance -LRB- Bloem , 2013 -RRB- .<-->O
With regard to knowledge of non-formal education , there also exists a gap , between the theoretical knowledge base and an abundance of practical experiences in non-formal education -LRB- Romi and Schmida , 2009 -RRB- .<-->O
The recent renewed focus on non-formal education for out-ofschool children and young people , however , has had a positive impact on the information and knowledge base .<-->O
The UNICEF and UIS Global Initiative on Out-of-school Children -LRB- OOSCI -RRB- is filling the statistical information and analysis gap , making available detailed profiles of out-ofschool children9 .<-->N
Other efforts in narrowing the knowledge gap include : the UIS report on Children Out of School -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; the annual monitoring by the EFA Global Monitoring Reports10 and the work of the Working Group on Non-Formal Education of the Association for the Development of Education in Africa -LRB- ADEA -RRB- 11 , UNESCO Bangkok12 , Educate a Child1 Across Europe , there is clear evidence of declining engagement in traditional democratic processes , with governments , companies and other organisations considered to be remote , and insufficiently accountable to their stakeholders .<-->O
Yet , it is also widely believed that globalisation calls for new , and more devolved kinds of political and social structure , in which individual citizens will play a more active part .<-->N
This suggests that people need to be re-engaged as ?<-->N
active citizens ?<-->N
, and enabled to take informed decisions about their lives , communities and workplaces .<-->N
However , many people are both disengaged and lack the skills , knowledge or understanding to do so .<-->O
This is particularly true for people with little formal education and most at risk of social exclusion on other grounds .<-->O
Governments have sought to address the issue through citizenship education programmes within formal schooling , but this can only have an impact in the long term and the benefits have yet to be demonstrated .<-->N
Little research has been conducted about how individuals learn to become such active citizens , the role of formal schooling in this , and the potential role of lifelong learning including less formal mode of learning .<-->O
The project has explored the nature of citizenship in six contrasting European countries -LRB- UK , Belgium , Finland , Netherlands , Slovenia , Spain -RRB- .<-->N
It has investigated how people have learned to be active citizens and what kinds of education and training exist to support this .<-->O
The project considered ?<-->N
active citizenship ?<-->N
as the active engagement in collective activity in one of four areas or ?<-->N
- the state/formal politics , the workplace , civil society and the private domain .<-->N
Key Conclusions The following key conclusions were reached : - 1.Decision-making is being increasingly devolved in organisations of all kinds .<-->N
This is because there is a belief that large centralised systems are increasingly difficult to manage and plan .<-->O
There is also a need to ensure democratic legitimacy for decisions and actions .<-->O
In several countries there was evidence of government trying to re-engage its citizens in these processes .<-->F
There is no simple standard model of what an active citizen is , nor any single process for developing citizenship .<-->N
The sense of citizenship is embedded in each individual?s unique life history and formed through relationships with others -LRB- individually and in groups -RRB- .<-->N
Active citizens have a strong sense of their place and responsibility in the world and are driven by a sense of commitment to other people , rooted in notions of justice and care .<-->O
The reasons for becoming an active citizen are formed early in life through the family and the community , at least as much as , or even more than , in school .<-->O
National differences in individuals ?<-->N
understanding of citizenship appear to mirror the differing historical experiences of citizenship and democratic politics in countries .<-->O
Despite notable changes in the operation of formal democracy and in social structures over the last half-century , no significant differences were found between active citizens born in the 1930s and 1940s and those born a generation later .<-->O
This may mean that change has been overstated or that the factors which make individuals active citizens remain constant , but apply to different , or fewer people .<-->O
Active citizens engage with the state when they wish to do so and on their own terms .<-->O
They are driven by personal ethical values and many are resistant to the competitive cultures of traditional political processes and parties .<-->O
Active citizens usually learn their citizenship skills through trying to solve a problem or to fulfil a mission , rather than by setting out to ?<-->O
learn to be good citizens ? .<-->N
Learning , and citizenship emerge as a consequence of this primary motivation .<-->N
Learning therefore has to be embedded in those processes .<-->N
Therefore , learning citizenship is unlike many more formal kinds of learning .<-->N
It is interactive and deeply embedded in specific contexts .<-->N
The outcomes of citizenship learning are unpredictable , and public interventions are most likely to be effective if they provide individuals with opportunities to explore and acquire the skills in context , rather than through formal instruction .<-->O
The skills and knowledge that active citizens develop in one area -LRB- political , work , civil society or private -RRB- are frequently transferred into the other areas .<-->O
Active citizens are notably energetic people and typically are active in several spheres .<-->O
Lifelong learning has become a major focus of policy attention for governments , private sector organisations and social movements , but the learning of citizenship in the area of civil society is still usually under-resourced by comparison with the workplace .<-->O
Whilst non-governmental organisations -LRB- NGOs -RRB- have succeeded in stimulating significant learning in civil society , its importance is still generally underestimated by governments .<-->O
As a result , work to develop citizenship skills in civil society tends to be short term , less systematic and less sustainable .<-->O
Those who suffer most from this are those who are already most vulnerable to social exclusion and least likely to become active citizens in any context .<-->O
Gender is a significant factor in determining how and where people engage as citizens , conditioned particularly by expectations of gender roles -LRB- which vary between the countries -RRB- , by social and political structures , and by the low value typically placed on citizenship in the private domain .<-->O
This is unfortunate since the home and early upbringing -LRB- typically dominated by women -RRB- are critical in creating the predisposition to be active citizens .<-->O
Other important areas of difference , including ethnicity , disability and sexuality , interact with gender to create complex patterns of inclusion and exclusion .<-->O
In addressing this it is important to ensure that educational interventions seek to give individuals the ability to analyse critically how institutions and cultures differentially affect individuals .<-->O
They also need to use group solidarity as a basis for empowering those least inclined to put themselves forward .<-->O
Active citizens appear in general to be more highly educated than their peers .<-->N
There is therefore a danger that citizenship becomes yet another area of exclusion for those who have previously been less successful in education , and who are already more prone to exclusion .<-->O
However , those who become active despite low levels of initial education often re-engage with formal education as a result .<-->O
Formal education in citizenship seems to have played little part in the formation of individuals .<-->N
However , extra-curricular activity during formal education does appear to be important , as do structures which give students a voice in the running of their educational institutions .<-->O
Key Recommendations 1 .<-->N
Governments and other organisations should create opportunities for individuals to learn citizenship skills through practice and participation in activities relevant to them across a range of contexts , and by supporting the development of learning resources .<-->O
Such learning is likely to foster transferable citizenship skills from one area to another and could create disproportionate benefits .<-->O
Governments , political parties , employers and trades unions should seek to develop more inclusive approaches to engagement in the political and workplace domains so that they appear less hostile and more supportive .<-->O
This could be aided by adopting a ?<-->N
learning organisation ?<-->N
approach and by encouraging the development of mentoring to help the less confident to develop relevant skills .<-->O
Trades unions often play an important role in assisting less advantaged individuals to be active citizens in the workplace ; this should be recognised and supported .<-->O
Governments and civil society organisations should provide more non-formal training for citizens involved in voluntary organisations .<-->O
This is a route through which many people find their way back into the formal education system after previous failure .<-->N
Governments should support embryonic civil society organisations .<-->O
The formation and early growth of such organisations provide important learning opportunities for individuals and groups , and are more effective when modest amounts of external expertise and support are provided .<-->O
Organisations funding informal learning in civil society organisations need to recognise the ?<-->O
character of citizenship learning , and develop funding regimes in which civil society organisations are more long-term and equal partners .<-->N
Governments and education providers -LRB- formal , non-formal and informal -RRB- should support the development of citizenship skills in home and private life , which may produce significant long-term benefits .<-->O
Parents and others involved with the primary caring role for young children should be supported to recognise and develop their roles in forming citizens .<-->N
Parent , family and women?s education are particularly relevant .<-->N
The EU and national governments should continue to encourage international exchanges for people of all ages , as they enable individuals and groups to see alternative perspectives and develop their ability to think laterally and be constructively critical of the status quo .<-->O
As citizenship skills appear to be developed more through extra-curricular activities than through the formal curriculum , schools and governments should encourage such activities .<-->O
Effort is required to ensure they are equally accessible to all , as extra-curricular opportunities are often disproportionately taken up by students from higher social classes .<-->N
There should be encouragement of initiatives that involve young people in the governance of their own educational and other institutions , as this is likely to be particularly helpful in creating a sense of engagement .<-->O
As there is a serious lack of research into the processes of informal citizenship learning within the workplace and civil society , funding organisations should support further research into the informal development of citizenship skills and knowledge .<-->O
Why Human Cloning Must Be Banned NowSince Scottish scientists succeeded in cloning the sheep known as Dolly , the prospect of human cloning has catapulted its way into the public consciousness .<-->N
In early 2000 , an Italian and a U.S. scientist announced their intention to clone human babies for infertile couples .<-->N
The duo recently announced their plans to begin implanting cloned human embryos into women -- a step they may have already taken by the time this article is published .<-->N
On July 31 , 2001 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed the `` Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 '' -LRB- H.R. 2505 -RRB- by a bi-partisan margin of 265-162 with support from liberal , progressive , conservative , pro-life , and pro-abortion members .<-->O
This bill , which Rep. Bart Stupak -LRB- D-MI -RRB- and I wrote , is designed to ban human cloning for both `` research '' and `` reproductive '' purposes .<-->N
Despite the fact that President Bush said he would sign this bill into law , Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle -LRB- D-SD -RRB- prevented the bill from even being considered in the Senate .<-->O
On Sunday , November 25 , 2001 , scientists at Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester , Massachusetts announced that they had created the first human embryo clones for the purpose of destructive research .<-->N
It is now more important than ever to ban human cloning .<-->N
H.R. 2505 specifically bans `` asexual reproduction '' which is accomplished by `` somatic cell nuclear transfer '' technology , the technique that was used to produce Dolly .<-->N
The bill does not ban scientifically and medically useful cloning practices such as the cloning of DNA fragments -LRB- molecular cloning -RRB- , the duplication of tissue or cells in culture -LRB- cell cloning -RRB- , or whole-organism or embryo cloning of non-human animals .<-->N
Nor does the bill ban laboratory practices such as parthenogenesis or `` twinning . ''<-->N
While most cloning advocates want to create cloned embryos for embryonic stem cell research -LRB- and oppose the creation of clones who would be implanted and carried to term -RRB- , others are racing to produce the world 's first cloned human baby .<-->O
Indeed , scientists such as Panos Zavos and Severino Antinori stated in mid-2000 that they expected to begin implanting cloned human embryos into women within the next several months .<-->N
They were enthusiastic about pursuing such a feat despite the serious genetic problems encountered in animal cloning , the known risks to the mother , and the great potential for serious birth defects .<-->O
Ninety-five to ninety-seven percent of animal cloning attempts still end in failure , and the scientists who cloned Dolly failed 276 times before they succeeded in producing a single live-born clone of an adult sheep .<-->N
Most scientific experts believe that attempts to clone humans will result in even higher failure rates .<-->O
Scientists such as Ian Wilmut -LRB- who produced Dolly -RRB- and Rudolf Jaenisch -LRB- of MIT -RRB- have concluded that the most likely cause of abnormal development in cloned animals is faulty reprogramming of the genome .<-->O
When the nucleus of a somatic cell is introduced into an enucleated egg , the DNA in the nucleus has to be `` reprogrammed '' in order for a human being to develop fully .<-->N
If this reprogramming of the nuclear DNA does not go exactly right , abnormal gene expression of one or some of the more than 30,000 genes can result .<-->O
Fortunately , the majority of Congress is outspokenly opposed to human cloning for reproductive purposes .<-->N
However , as evidenced in Senator Daschle 's move to delay consideration of H.R. 2505 , there is no such consensus when it comes to banning the cloning of embryos for research purposes .<-->O
However , this type of human cloning is also grossly unethical for at least three reasons .<-->O
First , research cloning can only be justified by the utilitarian calculus that prizes the lives of the millions of people who could potentially be treated or cured as a result of the research over the lives of the embryos who would be destroyed in order for the research to proceed .<-->O
However , it is never ethical to sacrifice one human life for the real or potential benefit of others .<-->O
Second , it is unethical to view a human being -- regardless of its age -- as a means to an end .<-->O
Even supporters of embryonic stem cell research and other embryo research have long been opposed to the `` special creation of embryos solely for the purpose of research . ''<-->N
However , this is precisely what is involved in research cloning .<-->N
To evade this criticism , proponents are now beginning to claim that human cloning for purposes of research does not create human embryos , but only `` activated cells . ''<-->O
Others are urging that the term `` cloning '' should not even be used to refer to this process .<-->N
As one scientist from Johns Hopkins stated in his recent testimony before the Senate , research cloning should be called `` nuclear transplantation , '' not `` cloning . ''<-->N
Many in the Senate have also sought to abandon the phrase `` therapeutic cloning '' -LRB- another popular term for research cloning -RRB- because it refers to cloning and could therefore conjure up opposition .<-->O
Third , research cloning will undoubtedly lead to a new exploitation of women .<-->O
In order to manufacture enough cloned embryos to create a sufficient number of viable stem cell lines , scientists will need to obtain massive quantities of women 's eggs .<-->O
To do so , women must be injected with superovulatory drugs and undergo an invasive procedure .<-->O
The Washington Post reported recently that the side effects of the injections are abdominal pain and nausea ; in 3 to 5 percent of cases hyperstimulation of the ovaries occurs , causing severe abdominal pain , and on rare occasions surgery is required which may leave the patient infertile .<-->O
Contrary to women who assume the risks associated with egg donation in order to undergo in vitro fertilization , women who take such risks for the purpose of research cloning would not be motivated by the desire to have a child , but , oftentimes , by the desire for financial gain .<-->O
Indeed , Advanced Cell Technology paid $ 3,500 - $ 4,000 to each woman who donated eggs for their failed cloning experiments .<-->N
It is likely that women of lower economic means will be exploited in this way .<-->N
In addition to the above ethical considerations , research cloning should be forbidden because it increases the likelihood of reproductive cloning .<-->O
Preventing the implantation and subsequent birth of cloned embryos once they are available in the laboratory will prove to be impossible .<-->O
The most effective way to ban reproductive cloning is to stop the process at the beginning , with the creation of cloned embryos .<-->N
Since the overwhelming consensus is that reproductive cloning should be prohibited , steps must be taken to ban research cloning as well .<-->O
It is nonsensical to believe that we can ban one without also banning the other .<-->N
Finally , research cloning is likely to fall woefully short of its alleged promise .<-->O
The Washington Post business section recently quoted William Haseltine , chief executive of Human Genome Sciences , Inc. , as saying -LRB- with regard to embryonic stem cell therapies -RRB- that `` the timeline to commercialization is so long that I simply would not invest .<-->O
You may notice that our company has not made such investments , and we have been offered the opportunity many times . ''<-->N
Furthermore , a recent New Scientist editorial stated that `` policy makers continue to enthuse about therapeutic cloning even though the majority of scientists no longer think it is possible or practical to treat patients with cells derived from cloned embryos .<-->O
They have already moved on to investigating the alternatives . ''<-->N
While embryonic stem cell research has yet to produce a single therapeutic modality that has proven to be clinically beneficial , the morally unproblematic alternative of adult stem cell research has already yielded several therapies that have been used to treat cartilage defects in children ; restore vision to patients who were legally blind ; relieve systemic lupus , multiple sclerosis , and rheumatoid arthritis ; and cure severe combined immunodeficiency -LRB- SCID -RRB- .<-->O
Finally , given that most scientists have predicted that human clones would be plagued with undetectable but harmful genetic abnormalities , such abnormalities might also be present in the tissues or cells derived from cloned human embryos .<-->O
There are no current or foreseeable methods available to assess whether the genome of a cloned embryo is free of such defects .<-->O
Human cloning is a benchmark for public policy , and the legislative decisions made regarding it will significantly impact the future of many areas of scientific research .<-->N
The public is being told that research cloning is good because it will yield miraculous cures ; however , even if scientists conclude that such cures will likely not result , research cloning will still be defended by those who wish to justify it on the basis of `` scientific freedom . ''<-->O
This appeal will also likely be heard in the coming debates over artificial intelligence , germ-line therapy , transgenics , etc. .<-->O
However , scientific freedom is not a fundamental right .<-->O
If we fail to ban all forms of human cloning , society 's continued ability to regulate or ban future scientific research will be seriously diminished in the name of autonomy and utilitarianism .<-->O
Human cloning for any purpose opens the door to a `` Brave New World , '' and we must shut that door now .<-->N
What is reproductive cloning -LRB- a.k.a. adult DNA Cloning -RRB- ?<-->N
Cloning is the production of one or more individual plants or animals that are genetically identical to another plant or animal .<-->F
Adult DNA cloning or Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer involves removing the DNA from an ovum and replacing it with the DNA from an adult animal .<-->F
Then , the embryo is allowed to develop into a new animal with the same DNA as the donor .<-->F
It has been used to clone a sheep and other animals .<-->N
It has not been tried on humans -LRB- as far as we know -RRB- .<-->N
horizontal rule How reproductive cloning is done : With the exception of the sperm and egg , every cell in the body contains all of the genetic material in its DNA to theoretically create an exact clone of the original body .<-->N
But cells have been biochemically programmed to perform limited functions .<-->N
The other functions are turned off .<-->N
Most scientists had believed that such differentiated cells could not be reprogrammed to be capable of behaving as a fertilized egg .<-->O
In the case of the sheep `` Dolly '' , a cell was taken from the mammary tissue of a mature 6 year old sheep while its DNA was in a dormant state .<-->N
It was fused with a sheep ovum which had had its nucleus removed .<-->F
The `` fertilized '' cell was then stimulated with an electric pulse .<-->F
Out of 277 attempts at cell fusion , only 29 began to divide .<-->F
These were all implanted in ewes .<-->F
Thirteen became pregnant but only one lamb , Dolly , was born .<-->N
Are clone embryos like IVF and normal pregnancies ?<-->N
Not so far .<-->N
The scientists at the Roslin Institute , who pioneered this work , have repeatedly found that the clone foetuses grow much larger than normal ones , and there is a much higher chance of the pregnancy failing , of stillbirth , or of forced Caesarean sections .<-->O
Dolly was the one successful pregnancy of more than 277 embryos .<-->N
So if I 'm cloned , the result will have exactly the same DNA as me ?<-->O
Only if you 're a woman and use one of your own eggs .<-->N
A key bit of DNA actually resides outside the nucleus , and is n't removed in the `` DNA transplant '' .<-->N
This is the mitochondrial DNA referred to by Ruth Deech -LRB- usually called the mtDNA -RRB- , which is passed down through the maternal line - everyone inherits their mother 's mtDNA .<-->N
So men ca n't be cloned exactly , unless they get an egg from an immediate female relative .<-->N
Cloning Risks -LSB- Excerpted from this article at the Roslin Institute . -RSB-<-->N
The risk is not simply a lack of a pregnancy .<-->O
In the three cloning experiments that have been carried out at the Roslin Institute so far , several lambs died late in pregnancy or soon after birth , and some of these had developmental abnormalities .<-->N
We do not know the reason for these failures , but the simplest explanation is that ` reprogramming ' of the transferred cells is not 100 % complete .<-->O
Even if a cloned baby appeared to be normal , we would not know what hidden legacy the boy or girl might carry .<-->O
The DNA that carries our genetic code is continually being damaged by ultraviolet radiation , free radicals generated within cells and chemicals from the environment .<-->N
Those cells in the body that divide and multiply rapidly - including critically those producing sperm - have efficient repair mechanisms .<-->O
Repair is much less effective in terminally differentiated cells and the gradual accumulation of so-called ` somatic mutations ' in the DNA of most of our cells is thought to contribute to aging and the incidence of cancer .<-->O
Objections to Human Reproductive Cloning From Why We Should Ban Human Cloning by George J. Annas and Why We Should Ban Human Cloning Now By Leon Kass The safety objection : Current cloning technology is not safe .<-->N
Cloned humans may have a high risk of genetic diseases and live shortened life spans .<-->O
Kass : Any attempt to clone a human being would constitute an unethical experiment upon the resulting child-to-be .<-->N
In all the animal experiments , fewer than two to three percent of all cloning attempts succeeded .<-->N
Not only are there fetal deaths and stillborn infants , but many of the so-called `` successes '' are in fact failures .<-->O
As has only recently become clear , there is a very high incidence of major disabilities and deformities in cloned animals that attain live birth .<-->O
Cloned cows often have heart and lung problems ; cloned mice later develop pathological obesity ; other live-born cloned animals fail to reach normal developmental milestones .<-->O
One possible response to the safety objection to cloning is the following argument : 1 .<-->O
To harm something means to make it worse off than it otherwise would have been .<-->O
But clones would not exist at all were it not for cloning .<-->F
Therefore , cloning is harmful to the clones only if it makes them worse off than not existing at all .<-->O
If a cloned embryo or fetus perishes before it becomes sentient , then the situation is equivalent to non-existence , and no harm is done .<-->N
If a cloned being suffers from being a clone , then this suffering is a harm only if its existence is worse than non-existence .<-->O
Therefore , the only cases in which cloning is a harm to the cloned are the cases in which the clones have sentient lives that are not worth living .<-->O
Even if early attempts at cloning humans results in genetic diseases and shortened life-spans , it does not follow that cloning is a harm .<-->N
After all , we do not say of people who live relatively short-lives or suffer from genetic diseases that their lives are not worth living .<-->O
In fact , the lives of clones would be worth living .<-->O
______________________________________________________ 8 .<-->N
Therefore , even if cloned humans have genetic diseases and shortened life-spans , cloning is not harmful .<-->N
In reply to this argument , it could be said that while creating a clone is , technically , not harmful to the clone , it is still not the best option for creating new human life .<-->O
Of course , one has no moral obligation to bring new human life into existence at all .<-->N
But , if one does choose to do so , then one has a moral obligation to use the best option of those available .<-->O
Given the shortcomings of current technology , cloning is not the best option .<-->O
There is simply no good reason to clone .<-->O
Annas : Embryo splitting might be justified if only a few embryos could be produced by an infertile couple and all were implanted at the same time -LRB- since this does not involve replicating an existing genome -RRB- .<-->O
But scenarios of cloning by nuclear transfer have involved older children , and the only reason to clone an existing human is to create a genetic replica .<-->N
Although it is possible to imagine some scenarios in which cloning could be used for the treatment of infertility , the use of cloning simply provides parents another choice for choice s sake , not out of necessity .<-->O
Comment : In general , arguing that there is no good reason to do something is not a way of showing that doing it is wrong .<-->O
Even if there is no reason to do it , there may not be a reason not to do it , either .<-->N
However , Annas would argue that if there is no reason to clone , then there is no reason to invest in research for reproductive cloning .<-->O
Research funds could be used elsewhere , on other technologies that do have real benefits .<-->O
The idea that cloning undermines the notion that children have their own and never-before-enacted life to live .<-->O
In cloning , according to Kass : the child is given a genotype that has already lived , with full expectation that this blueprint of a past life ought to be controlling the life that is to come . .<-->O
This is the open future objection .<-->N
Surely his or her new life would constantly be scrutinized in relation to that of the older version .<-->N
Even in the absence of unusual parental expectations for the clone -- say , to live the same life , only without its errors -- the child is likely to be ever a curiosity , ever a potential source of deja vu .<-->O
Unlike `` normal '' identical twins , a cloned individual -- copied from whomever -- will be saddled with a genotype that has already lived .<-->N
He will not be fully a surprise to the world : people are likely always to compare his doings in life with those of his alter ego , especially if he is a clone of someone gifted or famous .<-->O
True , his nurture and his circumstance will be different ; genotype is not exactly destiny .<-->O
But one must also expect parental efforts to shape this new life after the original -- or at least to view the child with the original version always firmly in mind .<-->O
For why else did they clone from the star basketball player , the mathematician , or the beauty queen -- or even dear old Dad -- in the first place ?<-->O
No longer only the sins of the parents , but also the genetic choices of the parents , will be visited on the children -- and beyond the third and fourth generation ; and everyone will know who is responsible .<-->O
No parent will be able to blame nature or the lottery of sex for an unhappy adolescent 's big nose , dull wit , musical ineptitude , nervous disposition , or anything else that he hates about himself .<-->O
Fairly or not , children will hold their cloners responsible for everything , for nature as well as for nurture .<-->O
Repugnance : Can anyone really give an argument fully adequate to the horror which is father-daughter incest , or having sex with animals , or mutilating a corpse , or eating human flesh Would anybody s failure to give full rational justification for his revulsion at those practices make that revulsion ethically suspect ?<-->O
Not at all We are repelled by the prospect of cloning human beings not because of the strangeness or the novelty of the undertaking , but because we intuit and we feel , immediately and without argument , the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear .<-->O
We sense that cloning represents a profound defilement of our given nature as procreative beings , and of the social relations built on this natural ground .<-->O
We also sense that cloning is a radical form of child abuse .<-->O
In this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done , and in which our bodies are regarded as mere instruments of our autonomous rational will , repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity .<-->O
Shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder .<-->N
The idea that cloning is wrong because it involves the manufacture and commodification of human beings : Annas : Using the bodies of children to replicate them encourages all of us to devalue children and treat them as interchangeable commodities .<-->O
For example , thanks to cloning , the death of a child need no longer be a singular human tragedy but , rather , can be an opportunity to try to replicate the no longer priceless -LRB- or irreplaceable -RRB- dead child .<-->O
No one should have such dominion over a child as to use his or her genes to create the child s child .<-->N
Kass : The problem is that any child whose being , character , and capacities exist owing to human design does not stand on the same plane as its makers .<-->N
As with any product of our making , no matter how excellent , the artificer stands above it , not as an equal but as a superior , transcending it by his will and creative prowess .<-->O
In human cloning human children become artifacts .<-->N
Such an arrangement is profoundly dehumanizing , no matter how good the product .<-->O
`` Human eggs for sale '' is already a big business , masquerading under the pretense of `` donation . ''<-->N
Newspaper advertisements on elite college campuses offer up to $ 50,000 for an egg `` donor '' tall enough to play women 's basketball and with SAT scores high enough for admission to Stanford ; and to nobody 's surprise , at such prices there are many young coeds eager to help shoppers obtain the finest babies money can buy .<-->O
When a couple normally chooses to procreate , the partners are saying yes to the emergence of new life in its novelty -- are saying yes not only to having a child , but also to having whatever child this child turns out to be .<-->O
This means that our children are not our children : they are not our property , they are not our possessions .<-->N
Neither are they supposed to live our lives for us , or to live anyone 's life but their own .<-->O
Their genetic distinctiveness and independence are the natural foreshadowing of the deep truth that they have their own , never-before-enacted life to live . .<-->O
Once it becomes possible , with the aid of human genomics , to produce or to select for what some regard as `` better babies '' -- smarter , prettier , healthier , more athletic -- parents will leap at the opportunity to `` improve '' their offspring .<-->O
Indeed , not to do so will be socially regarded as a form of child neglect .<-->O
Those who would ordinarily be opposed to such tinkering will be under enormous pressure to compete on behalf of their as yet unborn children -- just as some now plan almost from their children 's birth how to get them into Harvard .<-->O
Never mind that , lacking a standard of `` good '' or `` better , '' no one can really know whether any such changes will truly be improvements .<-->O
Large scale cloning would raise a host of ethical issues .<-->N
If there are many clones of one individual , would they be treated as individuals ?<-->N
Would they be treated as second-class citizens ?<-->N
Would cloning allow certain powerful individuals to increase or consolidate their power in society by making copies of themselves ?<-->O
Or the reverse : would people be cloned specifically for the purpose of serving others ?<-->N

Why All Human Cloning Should be Banned The push for human cloning continues around the world .<-->N
Sure , most people say they do not want to see humans cloned , but they do want to see cloned embryos for research purposes .<-->O
Yet as I and others must keep reiterating , the two processes therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning are exactly the same , at least at the outset .<-->O
Both utilise the exact same process and both end up with the same result : a newly cloned human being .<-->N
It is just that in so-called therapeutic cloning the human is killed very early on so that the stem cells can be extracted for testing , research and so on .<-->O
In reproductive cloning , this new embryo would be allowed to develop , be implanted , and eventually be born .<-->N
It is vital that people understand these facts , as there is a lot of hype and misrepresentation about the two sorts of cloning .<-->O
In this regard , an older -LRB- October 8 , 2004 -RRB- article put out by the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity in Chicago is worth revisiting .<-->O
It nicely lays out the case as to why cloning must be opposed .<-->O
Written by John F. Kilner and Robert P. George and entitled Human Cloning : What s at Stake , the article makes the case for a complete ban on all forms of human cloning .<-->N
The authors begin by noting what the cloning process will produce : A human individual brought into existence by cloning would be a member of the species homo sapiens .<-->N
He or she would possess a human genetic structure and a rational nature .<-->O
There is no reason to suppose that such a person would not possess the same basic dignity and be endowed with the same fundamental rights as everybody else .<-->O
As such , cloning should be prohibited : At the deepest level , cloning should be prohibited because it turns procreation into a species of manufacture .<-->O
It treats a child-to-be as an object of production .<-->N
In the words of Dr. Leon Kass , Chairman of the President s Council on Bioethics , cloning threatens the dignity of human procreation , giving one generation unprecedented genetic control over the next .<-->O
It is the first step toward a eugenic world in which children become objects of manipulation and products of will .<-->N
They continue , Cloning also carries high risks of bodily harm to the child produced through cloning .<-->N
Experiments in the cloning of animals reveals that a high percentage of clones of any mammalian species are born with , or develop , severe deformities or abnormalities .<-->O
Indeed , Dolly the sheep , the most famous of all cloned mammals , was afflicted with a grave premature arthritis .<-->O
In fact , Dolly had to be put down prematurely because of these problems .<-->O
The article then focus on the two sorts of cloning : Of course , some people try to distinguish reproductive cloning , that is , cloning to produce a child , from what they call therapeutic or research cloning the creation of human embryos for experimental purposes in which they would be killed to harvest stem cells .<-->O
This , however , is a false distinction .<-->O
All cloning is reproductive .<-->N
A human embryo the being created by human cloning is nothing less than a human being in the earliest stages of natural development .<-->N
You and we and everybody else on the planet were at an earlier stage of our lives human embryos , just as every reader of these words was once a toddler , and before that an infant , and before that a fetus .<-->O
Furthermore , no cloning is , properly speaking , therapeutic .<-->N
Cloning in the cause of biomedical experimentation is of no benefit to the subject of cloning , namely , the cloned embryo .<-->N
On the contrary , that embryo is killed for the putative benefit of others .<-->N
That is why a ban on all cloning must be demanded .<-->N
The only way we can prevent cloning to produce children is if we see it all banned : A mere prohibition of the implantation of cloned embryos will not hold up .<-->O
There will be no effective way to prevent embryos created by cloning from being implanted in the prepared uterus of a willing woman .<-->O
But what about the possible cures and therapies that might be derived from therapeutic cloning ?<-->O
Of course , this is a worthy end ; the ethical problem is with the means they propose to use .<-->O
It is not simply that supporters have grossly hyped the therapeutic value of cloning although this itself is an ethical issue inasmuch as it has unfairly elevated the hopes of many people suffering with neurodegenerative diseases and other afflictions .<-->O
Let us not forget that the worst research atrocities in history have resulted from succumbing to the temptation to pursue scientific progress at the expense of a relatively small group who have been harmed in the process .<-->O
Nor will considerations of sacrificing some for the sake of others suffice here : The utilitarian idea that we can justify doing a little evil for the sake of a greater good should be firmly rejected .<-->O
The norm that should control our scientific ethics , and our law , is the principle of the inherent dignity of every human being , irrespective of age , size , location , stage of development , or condition of dependency .<-->O
Human beings from the embryonic stage to adulthood are always ends in themselves , and must never be treated as mere means to other people s ends .<-->O
And this must apply across the board : This principle of inherent dignity should be applied with no less force to the cloned human being who is brought to birth and dwells among us .<-->O
Once a human being exists , he or she is of no less value or dignity by virtue of the wrongful means by which he or she was brought into existence .<-->O
Just as a human clone should not be killed before birth , he or she should not be discriminated against or in any way mistreated after he or she is born .<-->O
The great political principle of human equality , rooted in the profound theological idea that men and women are made in the very image and likeness of God , demands no less .<-->O
At stake here is the very notion of what it means to be human , and what is the value of human life .<-->O
If we are to be sacrificed as research fodder for possible good ends , what of the means ?<-->N
It is one thing to voluntarily give oneself up for the sake of others .<-->N
But to experiment on an unwilling victim , as an embryo is , is a violation of the basic principles of human medicine .<-->O
There are always debates about where we should draw the line .<-->N
Surely the integrity and sanctity of human life must be one area where a line is clearly drawn and never violated .<-->O
This is a perceptive analysis , Bill .<-->N
I am supportive of your views that cloning , whether for therapeutic or reproductive reasons , involves the destruction of human life -LRB- which I am convinced , biblically , commences at conception -RRB- .<-->O
I have found that evangelical Christian married couples who find themselves infertile , readily seek IVF treatment , without considering the ethical ramifications .<-->N
A significant part of this , I believe , is related to so little teaching in the churches on these practical matters .<-->O
I commend you for your substantive and challenging insights and pro-active stance on these critical matters in our culture .<-->O
How do you think that we can address the biblical naivete on these issues in the local church ?<-->N
You are doing it on your website .<-->N
We can do it one church at a time as you and I engage in cultural apologetics .<-->N
However , what about the vast masses of evangelicals who don t do much thinking in this area ?<-->O
Do you have thoughts on how to reach them ?<-->N
You might prefer to respond via my email address .<-->O
Bill I always admire your articles and agree whole heartedly that cloning of all kinds should be banned .<-->O
So here s my opinion .<-->N
I agree with both sides of why cloning should be legal or illegal .<-->O
I agree when people say that cloning should be legal because you could , partially , bring a loved one back if they died in a car crash or of a disease .<-->O
Yes , I know that they couldn t really bring the person back , but the thought that the person was kind of there would make me feel better .<-->O
But I also agree that cloning should be banned because of the people out there who would use their organs for their personal use .<-->O
It s so wrong that anybody would do that .<-->O
Im 14 and I just finished reading the Scorpion book .<-->N
I m doing a project on it right now about how cloning should be banned .<-->O
If you ve ever read that book you would know how sick El Patron was and how sweet Matt was .<-->O
But they were the same person .<-->N
The book though was amazing , and I highly recommend it .<-->O
Great article .<-->N
I agree 100 % .<-->N
Your article is very well written and I found it to be very informative .<-->O
At first my perception of human cloning was more closed and biased , I was instantly against an issue like that .<-->O
Your article helped me to understand why people would want to do this and I guess it depends on your personal situation and moral beliefs .<-->O
I am wondering how this issue will affect us a hundred years from now and I just hope it stays under control .<-->O
I totally agree the part about them killing them early really made me realise that cloning is pointless Watch Another Anti Cloning Video Should we ban human cloning ?<-->O
Arguments against cloning Here are three reasons why we should say no to cloning - disadvantages : 1 .<-->N
Health risks from mutation of genes An abnormal baby would be a nightmare come true .<-->O
The technique is extremely risky right now .<-->O
A particular worry is the possibility that the genetic material used from the adult will continue to age so that the genes in a newborn baby clone could be - say - 30 years old or more on the day of birth .<-->O
Many attempts at animal cloning produced disfigured monsters with severe abnormalities .<-->N
So that would mean creating cloned embryos , implanting them and destroying -LRB- presumably -RRB- those that look imperfect as they grow in the womb .<-->O
However some abnormalities may not appear till after birth .<-->N
A cloned cow recently died several weeks after birth with a huge abnormality of blood cell production .<-->O
Dolly the Sheep died prematurely of severe lung disease in February 2003 , and also suffered from arthritis at an unexpectedly early age - probably linked to the cloning process .<-->O
Even if a few cloned babies are born apparently normal we will have to wait up to 20 years to be sure they are not going to have problems later - for example growing old too fast .<-->O
Every time a clone is made it is like throwing the dice and even a string of `` healthy '' clones being born would not change the likelihood that many clones born in future may have severe medical problems .<-->O
And of course , that 's just the ones born .<-->N
What about all the disfigured and highly abnormal clones that either spontaneously aborted or were destroyed / terminated by scientists worried about the horrors they might be creating .<-->O
Emotional risks A child grows up knowing her mother is her sister , her grandmother is her mother .<-->N
Her father is her brother-in-law .<-->N
Every time her mother looks at her , she is seeing herself growing up .<-->N
Unbearable emotional pressures on a teenager trying to establish his or her identity .<-->O
What happens to a marriage when the `` father '' sees his wife 's clone grow up into the exact replica -LRB- by appearance -RRB- of the beautiful 18 year old he fell in love with 35 years ago ?<-->O
A sexual relationship would of course be with his wife 's twin , no incest involved technically .<-->N
Or maybe the child knows it is the twin of a dead brother or sister .<-->N
What kind of pressures will he or she feel , knowing they were made as a direct replacement for another ?<-->O
It is a human experiment doomed to failure because the child will NOT be identical in every way , despite the hopes of the parents .<-->O
One huge reason will be that the child will be brought up in a highly abnormal household : one where grief has been diverted into makeing a clone instead of adjusting to loss .<-->O
The family environment will be totally different than that the other twin experienced .<-->N
That itself will place great pressures on the emotional development of the child .<-->O
You will not find a child psychiatrist in the world who could possibly say that there will not be very significant emotional risk to the cloned child as a result of these pressures .<-->O
Risk of abuse of the technology What would Hitler have done with cloning technology if available in the 1940s ?<-->O
There are powerful leaders in every generation who will seek to abuse this technology for their own purposes .<-->O
Going ahead with cloning technology makes this far more likely .<-->N
You can not have so-called therapeutic cloning without reproductive cloning because the technique to make cloned babies is the same as to make a cloned embryo to try to make replacement tissues .<-->N
And at the speed at which biotech is accelerating there will soon be other ways to get such cells - adult stem cell technology .<-->N
It is rather crude to create a complete embryonic identical twin embryo just to get hold of stem cells to make - say - nervous tissue .<-->O
Much better to take cells from the adult and trigger them directly to regress to a more primitive form without the ethical issues raised by inserting a full adult set of genes into an unfertilised egI recently wrote a paper for a Moral Reasoning course in defense of human cloning .<-->O
The concept of human cloning seems a bit frightening to me , but I don t think that s altogether rational .<-->O
Let me first define human cloning by the current hypothetical techniques for doing so .<-->N
Human cloning is the creation of a human being , or human tissues , using 100 % of the nuclear genetic material from a donor .<-->N
You have to know a little bit about biology to fully understand this , but essentially the process means that instead of having two parents each donating 50 % of their genetic code , randomly only one parent donates complete DNA , making the child , or clone , a genetic duplicate of the parent .<-->O
To examine the issue of human cloning , let s consider the following benefits why would we even consider cloning humans in the first place ?<-->O
I won t lay out the entire list of benefits , but instead present the four general categories of benefit : To create donor organs or tissues -LRB- rather than new people -RRB- for therapy to cure diseases ; To create donor tissues to prevent aging and prolong lifespan ; As an alternate means of reproduction ; To learn more about genetics through the process of studying and implementing cloning in practice .<-->O
There are a number of objections and fears about cloning , as well : The fear that cloned humans will lack individuality , or infringe upon the uniqueness of the donor .<-->O
The fear that cloned humans will experience social hardships ; The fear that genetic diversity will be reduced , threatening humanity as a species ; The fear that cloning will result in the manufacturing and marketing of human beings ; The religious objection that human cloning is playing God ; The objection that until a human is cloned , the risk to the clone is uncertain , making it unethical to attempt cloning .<-->O
to which offer the following points : On concerns about individuality : Reasearch into human cloning may also allow A cloned human will be no less an individual than monozygotic -LRB- or identical -RRB- twins are individuals .<-->O
Identical twins share 100 % of their genetic material , and occur in nature .<-->N
They do not lack individuality .<-->N
What s more , they are further separated in time than identical twins , and more likely to be raised in different environments , making their individuality potentially greater than that of natural twins .<-->O
On concerns about social norms : A cloned human may appear to lack the normal structure of a family .<-->O
It has also been suggested that the fact that clones effectively have three parents a genetic mother and father -LRB- the same parents as the original donor -RRB- , and a direct parent -LRB- the donor -RRB- .<-->O
They may also have adoptive parents who are none of these three .<-->N
While the social dynamic of a cloned person s family may be unusual or difficult to assimilate , it is not much different than cases of adopted children , children born to surrogate mothers , or children born to single parents -LRB- to widows , or by in-vitro fertilization -RRB- .<-->O
The law allows these situations to arise , and it can be argued that cloning presents little difference .<-->N
On concerns about genetic diversity : The argument here is simple .<-->O
Unless the genetic diversity of the human race dwindles so much that there are fewer than 1000 genetically unique individuals , we have little cause for concern about the survival of the human race as a whole .<-->O
On the manufacturing of human beings : The idea that we ll end up with designer babies if cloning is allowed is a slippery-slope argument .<-->N
We can easily restrict these things without banning cloning entirely .<-->O
Yes , cloning opens these things up as a possibility , but so do most forms of genetic manipulation .<-->O
The cloning of human beings still requires surrogate mothers , which prevents visions of clone factories from appearing .<-->N
In societies that do not allow the sale of human beings anyways , this may not be much of a concern .<-->O
On religious concerns : I do have respect for religion , but in democratic societies where government is secular , this can not be a driving principle .<-->O
While certain groups may decline to participate in cloning , religious principles are not grounds for legal restriction .<-->O
On the ethics of even trying : This , I think , is one of the biggest problems .<-->O
When creating the first human clone , we run the risk of producing a person who will suffer some hardships they may experience medical problems , age unexpectedly quickly , or have trouble integrating into society if their origin is known publicly , especially when clones are uncommon .<-->O
It s also possible that failed attempts at cloning may produce deformed , disabled or short-lived humans who will undergo unneccessary suffering .<-->O
The fact that we can not be certain of the risks in cloning a human until we clone a human successfully .<-->O
The best counter-argument against these concerns is that the process must not be done hastily , and must see success in other animals first .<-->O
We may wish to clone other primates , and eventually chimpanzees -LRB- who are the animals most similar to humans , genetically -RRB- , before attempting to clone a human being .<-->N
Only with repeated success in other animals will this concern start to fade .<-->O
I m not convinced that an outright ban on human clothing is justifiable .<-->O
I think there are certainly valid ethical concerns , but the result should be regulation and care , rather than a reluctance to even try .<-->O
What do you think should we ban cloning ?<-->N
Should we ban human cloning ?<-->N
Research cloning produces a single-cell human embryo .<-->N
It is a settled , scientific fact that human life begins at the single cell embryo stage , whether created through sexual -LRB- the exclusive means until now -RRB- or asexual reproduction -LRB- as with cloning -RRB- .<-->N
As does any human being , the cloned human being progresses through every stage of life -- embryonic , fetal , infant , adult -- unless something occurs to cause its death .<-->N
Research cloning kills embryonic human beings for the purpose of experimentation .<-->F
Cloning endangers and exploits women .<-->F
Research cloning requires the harvesting of millions of eggs from women .<-->N
The egg harvesting process involves a drug treatment and invasive procedure that endangers women by placing them at a higher risk for ovarian cancer , infertility , and other health hazards .<-->O
Egg harvesting also exploits women by treating them as mere egg-making machines , and creating a massive market for eggs and egg donors that would take advantage of poor , disadvantaged women .<-->O
Cloning violates the Nuremberg Code .<-->N
The Nuremburg Code condemned the atrocities of the Nazis and affirmed the ethical principles of the civilized world , including the principle that experiments should not be conducted on human beings when it is known beforehand that death will result .<-->O
Research cloning violates this principle because it involves the deliberate creation and killing of embryonic human beings .<-->N
Research cloning is unnecessary for medical progress .<-->N
Although cloning advocates claim that embryonic stem cell research will lead to miracle cures , not a single patient is currently being treated using such research .<-->O
The promises of future miracle cures from research on cloned embryos are also similarly inflated .<-->N
However , numerous studies do show the current therapeutic benefits of medical treatments derived -LRB- ethically -RRB- from adult stem cells and umbilical cord cells .<-->N
Only a ban on all cloning is enforceable .<-->N
The U.S. Department of Justice has pointed out it would be virtually impossible to enforce a ban only on reproductive cloning .<-->N
If cloned human embryos can be produced in labs , there would be no way to ensure they were not implanted in women and brought to birth .<-->N
Funding research cloning is irresponsible .<-->N
There are limited funds for research .<-->N
Scarce research funding should not be wasted on highly speculative research on cloned embryos .<-->N
There is far more promising and ethical research using adult stem cells and umbilical cord cells to be funded .<-->O
Research cloning violates the American principle of equality .<-->N
The United States was founded upon the principle that all people are created equal .<-->N
This principle is put at risk by research cloning which would create , use , and destroy embryonic human beings .<-->O
Once human life has been created , proponents of its use and destruction must convince the public that there is a reason to deny the protection we give to every other human life .<-->O
They can only do so by arguing that some lives are not worthy of protection .<-->O
But this is a perilous argument for it leaves to the powerful to decide who is protected .<-->O
Reproductive cloning damages the family .<-->N
Reproductive cloning would confuse family relationships .<-->N
A cloned child would have only one parent , who would be its genetic twin .<-->N
Would the clone be the person 's child or sibling ?<-->N
This would also pose great problems of inheritance -LRB- What status would the clone have versus other family members ? -RRB- .<-->O
Finally , cloning could mean more children would grow up in single-parent households , without the benefit of married parents .<-->O
Good science is ethical science .<-->N
Business and science , like every other human endeavor , must be subject to ethical limits .<-->O
Unless the Congress acts to ban all cloning , biotechnology companies and research scientists , like those at Stanford University 's new stem cell research lab , will proceed with the cloning of human beings .<-->O
Most Americans and other countries oppose all human cloning .<-->N
A majority of Americans support a ban on both reproductive and research cloning .<-->N
Many countries and international organizations , including Germany , Switzerland , the European Parliament , and others , have banned all human cloning .<-->N
Viewpoint : Yes , because of the potential physical dangers and the profound ethical dilemmas it poses , the cloning of human beings should be prohibited .<-->O
Viewpoint : No , the cloning of human beings should not be prohibited because the potential for medical accidents or malfeasance is grossly overstated , and the ethical questions raised by detractors are not unique to cloning indeed , ethical questions attend every scientific advancement .<-->O
Since the birth of Dolly , the cloned sheep , in 1997 , several reproductive scientists , including Severino Antinori , Brigitte Boisselier , and Panayiotis Michael Zavos , have announced that they were ready to clone human beings .<-->N
However , cloning mammals is still a highly experimental technique .<-->N
Scientists involved in cloning various mammals have reported many technical problems .<-->N
A large majority of the clones die during gestation or soon after birth .<-->N
Placental malfunction seems to be a major cause of death .<-->N
Many of the surviving clones are plagued with serious physiological and genetic problems .<-->N
During embryological development , cloned sheep , cows , pigs , and mice tend to become unusually large .<-->N
Clones are often born with a condition called `` large offspring syndrome , '' as well as severe respiratory and circulatory defects , malformations of the brain or kidneys , or immune dysfunction .<-->O
It is not yet known whether clones will develop and age normally , or whether subtle failures in genomic reprogramming or genetic imprinting might lead to various defects .<-->O
Theoretically , tissues generated from cells cloned from a patient 's own adult nucleus should not trigger an immune response , but it is possible that subtle differences caused by the foreign cytoplasm in the donor egg might cause a rejection response .<-->O
Although scientists at Duke University suggested that human clones might not experience the problems encountered in cloned animals , the risks remains very high and quite unpredictable .<-->O
Eventually animal research may indicate that human cloning can be accomplished with no greater risk than in vitro fertilization posed when Louise Brown , the first `` test-tube baby '' was born in 1978 .<-->N
However , scientists generally agree that human reproductive cloning should not be permitted before the scientific and technical issues have been clarified .<-->N
Many scientists believe that , at least in the near future , experiments in human cloning would involve many failures , miscarriages , stillbirths , and the birth of deformed babies .<-->O
Some observers think that the reckless claims made by some scientists stimulated the passage of premature Congressional legislation that would ban all human cloning , both reproductive and therapeutic -LRB- non-reproductive -RRB- .<-->O
Similar reactions have occurred in other nations .<-->N
For example , the French and German governments jointly asked the United Nations to call for a worldwide ban on human reproductive cloning .<-->N
After a heated debate about human cloning , on July 31 , 2001 , the U. S. House of Representatives voted 265-162 to institute a total federal ban on human cloning .<-->N
The bill included penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine .<-->N
The House rejected competing measures that would have banned cloning for reproductive purposes while allowing nonreproductive or therapeutic cloning for scientific research .<-->N
The emotional nature of the debate , and the lack of understanding of the scientific aspects of the subject , is epitomized by House Majority Whip Tom Delay -LRB- R-Texas -RRB- who declared : `` Human beings should not be cloned to stock a medical junkyard of spare parts . ''<-->O
On the other hand , Rep. Jim Greenwood -LRB- R-Pennsylvania -RRB- lamented that the House had missed an opportunity to balance potential biomedical breakthroughs with ethical concerns .<-->O
The Human Cloning Prohibition Act outlaws the process known as somatic cell nuclear transfer -LRB- SCNT -RRB- using human cells .<-->N
Although this process can be used for reproductive cloning , as in the case of Dolly the sheep , the technique can also be used for non-reproductive or therapeutic cloning , a process that could be used to create cells and tissues that would be immunologically compatible with the donor of the nuclear material .<-->O
The potential uses of therapeutic cloning include cures and treatments for many diseases .<-->N
Cloned cells could be used to create replacement tissue for diseased hearts , pancreatic cells for diabetics , treatments for neurodegenerative diseases , such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's , nerve cells for victims of spinal cord injuries , and skin cells for burn victims .<-->O
Researchers , as well as leaders of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies , believe that therapeutic cloning will result in major medical breakthroughs .<-->O
Therapeutic cloning could provide valuable new means of testing drugs for safety and efficacy , thus streamlining and improving the drug development process .<-->O
Another modification of the nuclear replacement technique known as oocyte nucleus transfer could help women with defective mitochondrial DNA .<-->O
Defects in mitochondrial DNA are known to cause more than 50 inherited metabolic diseases .<-->N
Theoretically , a child produced by this process would inherit its nuclear DNA from its mother and father and healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor egg .<-->N
This procedure would not constitute reproductive cloning because the child 's genetic makeup would be as unique as that of a child produced by conventional sexual means .<-->O
Nonreproductive cloning is legal in the United Kingdom .<-->N
Since the early 1990s British scientists have been allowed to create human embryos for research purposes and perform experiments in therapeutic cloning .<-->F
The Human Fertilization and Embryology Act of 1990 established a system for regulating the creation and use of embryos .<-->N
Research leading to reproductive cloning is banned , but therapeutic cloning in order to generate healthy replacements for diseased tissues and organs is permitted .<-->O
Some ethicists and religious leaders object to all experiments on embryos , while others argue that even therapeutic cloning should be banned because it would eventually lead to reproductive cloning .<-->O
While human cloning and human stem cell research are actually technically distinct , these issues have become virtually inseparable because both involve the use of human embryos .<-->N
President George W. Bush , who opposes cloning humans for research and reproductive purposes , immediately announced support for the anti-cloning bill passed by the House .<-->O
President Bush has taken the position that : `` like a snowflake , each of these embryos is unique with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being . ''<-->O
Further confusion and controversy was , therefore , sparked by Bush 's decision to allow limited federal financing for stem cell research on 60 cell lines that had already been established .<-->O
Despite recognition of the potential value of the research , the president ruled out any future flexibility in his stem cell policy .<-->O
Thus , Bush 's decision angered groups on both sides of the argument : those who hoped that stem cell research would help people with serious diseases and disabilities and those who believe that the fertilized egg should be accorded full human status .<-->O
Less than a month after President Bush announced his decision on embryonic stem cell research observers noted that the substance of public debate had shifted from whether such research was ethical to a debate about whether essential biomedical research could be conducted in the United States .<-->O
Despite confusion about scientific and technical issues , there is widespread public awareness of predictions that human cloning and stem cell research could provide treatments and cures for many diseases , if scientists are allowed the freedom to pursue all promising pathways .<-->O
If patients and their advocacy groups think that cures are being withheld because of political and religious forces , there is little doubt that the nature of the public debate will become increasingly hostile .<-->O
The debate about the scientific and technical uncertainties of human cloning will presumably be settled in the not-too-distant future through experimentation in countries that allow this type of research to proceed .<-->O
The situation is likely to be quite different where ethical issues are concerned .<-->O
Those at one extreme believe that the use of embryos for research purposes is morally unacceptable on the grounds that an embryo should be accorded full human status from the moment of its creation .<-->O
In contrast , some people believe that early embryos should not be considered human begins with special moral rights .<-->O
Others consider the embryo a potential human being , but argue that the rights of the early embryo should be weighed against the potential benefits arising from research .<-->O
The British Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act attempted to maintain an ethical `` middle ground . ''<-->N
Indeed , British authorities suggested that cloning embryos by the cell nuclear replacement technique that produced Dolly might be considered a form of transitional methodology that could eventually provide insights into genetic mechanisms for reprogramming adult cells .<-->O
Although many Americans believe that stem cell research and therapeutic cloning are morally justifiable because they offer the promise of curing disease and alleviating human suffering , others are unequivocally opposed to all forms of experimentation involving human embryos .<-->O
Despite the potential benefits of cloning and stem cell research , most scientists acknowledge that there are still many technical and scientific problems .<-->O
However , even if the scientific issues are resolved , ethical , emotional , and political issues will probably continue to dominate debates about human cloning .<-->O
LOIS N. MAGNER Viewpoint : Yes , because of the potential physical dangers and the profound ethical dilemmas it poses , the cloning of human beings should be prohibited .<-->O
On July 31 , 2001 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to prohibit the cloning of human beings -LRB- Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 , H.R. 2505 -RRB- .<-->N
As defined in the bill , `` human cloning means human asexual reproduction , accomplished by introducing nuclear material from one or more human somatic cells into a fertilized or unfertilized oocyte whose nuclear material has been removed or inactivated so as to produce a living organism -LRB- at any stage of development -RRB- that is genetically virtually identical to an existing or previously existing human organism . ''<-->N
The bill makes it a federal crime with stiff penalties , including a fine of up to $ 1 million and imprisonment up to 10 years to attempt to or participate in an attempt to perform human cloning as defined by the act .<-->O
With this step the United States is now poised to join the international community .<-->N
Many nations have already adopted the prohibition against human cloning .<-->N
International scientific bodies with oversight for medicine , research , and health as well as biotechnology industry interest groups mostly support the prohibition .<-->O
But the matter is not yet settled .<-->N
Before the measure can take effect , it faces a vote in the U.S. Senate and it needs the president 's signature .<-->N
What reasons or fears prompted U.S. law-makers to take such strong measures ?<-->O
The sanctions in the act are more commonly associated with major felonies .<-->N
Are there sufficient dangers to the nation and to its citizens to call for prohibition of a scientific technique whose applicability to humans seems as yet theoretical ?<-->N
Since 1997 , when Dolly the sheep , the first mammal ever derived from a cell -LRB- from the udder -RRB- of an adult mammal -LRB- sheep -RRB- , was announced to the world , the possibility of human cloning has entered a new stage .<-->N
After 276 unsuccessful attempts , the `` cloned '' embryo implanted in a ewe went through the normal gestation period and was born alive , surviving and healthy to the present .<-->O
This was indeed a first and a major breakthrough .<-->O
Since that event , the feat has been replicated in several types of livestock on different occasions .<-->N
In 1998 mice were successfully cloned from adult cells .<-->N
Humans bear certain genetic similarities to mice , and so often mice are the experimental model for what will be studied subsequently in humans .<-->O
The technique of cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer -LRB- SCNT -RRB- is steadily improving , suggesting a certain momentum .<-->N
The animal successes have inspired some groups and scientists to announce publicly their aim of embarking on the cloning of human beings through the same technique that gave us Dolly and the several other groups of mammals that followed .<-->N
Asexual Reproduction The technique itself raises fundamental questions .<-->N
SCNT , as noted in the definition of the Human Cloning Prohibition Act , involves taking a cell many types of cells seem to work from a full-grown animal and removing the nucleus , which contains the complete genetic makeup , or DNA , of the animal .<-->N
The nuclear DNA is then inserted into a separate unfertilized but enucleated ovum harvested from an adult mammal , even a mammal of a different species .<-->N
After special preparation in a nutrient medium to allow the cell to reprogram itself and a small trigger of electric current to start mitosis , the `` cloned '' blastocyst , now with the nuclear DNA of an adult somatic cell in each of the multiplying cells , is implanted in the womb of a `` gestational '' mother , previously treated and made ready to accept the pregnancy .<-->O
If the process is successful , the resultant birth yields a new individual animal , genetically identical to the animal that donated the nucleus yet at the same time different from any other animal : the DNA in the nucleus of its cells does not come from the mating of two animals , in which each parent 's DNA combines to create a new individual .<-->N
Rather the DNA is from one animal only .<-->N
Sexual reproduction with its commingling of the genetic endowment of two individuals has demonstrated its existential value .<-->N
Over hundreds of millions of years , nature has used the process to great advantage to perpetuate and vary species , to bring new beings and new species into existence throughout the plant and animal kingdoms , to ensure the continued and enhanced adaptation of living things to changing environments , and to preserve life itself .<-->O
It is also the process that in our experience gives the `` stamp of individuality , '' producing new members of a species with a novel genetic endowment and , not rarely , new individuals with traits that are remarkable and prized as well as unique .<-->O
The Status of a Clone Perhaps a superior or functionally perfect breed of animal might offer special advantages although a world of racing in which thousands of Secretariats challenged each other over and over might give oddsmakers and bettors nightmares .<-->O
Then again , some rare or endangered species might be preserved .<-->O
When we turn to humans , however , the technique raises many questions and challenges regarding our most important values and basic notions .<-->O
Intuitively , then , we ask , `` What kind of human being would the individual be who has the nuclear DNA of another preexisting individual ? ''<-->N
Would the `` clone '' be another individual human being or somehow not `` truly '' human ?<-->N
Is the `` latest edition '' of the cloned individual an individual in his or her own right ?<-->N
If he or she has the nuclear DNA from only one preexisting individual , if he or she was not the product of separate sperm and ovum , would such an individual fit the term `` human , '' the way the rest of us do ?<-->O
What of the relationship to the individual supplying the DNA ?<-->N
How would we describe their relationship ?<-->N
Would the term `` parent '' fit the relationship ?<-->N
Could this clone of an individual ever be accepted by society ?<-->N
Or , much more profoundly , could the clone come to accept himself or herself as each one of us do : a unique and special person , with a nature and a future that is no one else 's ?<-->O
The ready response to questions like these is to recognize that the questions relate to imponderables .<-->N
Of course , we wonder about them , but there is no evidence on which we can base an answer and no way of predicting the reactions of the clone or of society to the clone .<-->N
We can only surmise that , just as now , if there were a world where clones existed , there would be tolerance and prejudice .<-->O
Some individuals would display resilience and others would experience psychological challenges that test them sorely .<-->O
People and the laws of society would adjust in time , just as we have for artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization .<-->O
If anything , the imponderables Matilda , a sheep cloned in Australia .<-->N

Matilda , a sheep cloned in Australia .<-->F
-LRB- AFP/Corbis .<-->F
Reproduced by permission . -RRB-<-->N
ought to give us pause , to prompt us to think before taking any fateful steps to clone a human being .<-->O
Yet are the imponderables grounds enough to restrict the freedom of inquiry our society endorses ?<-->O
What does prohibiting experiments in human cloning in fact , making it a crime do for our right to pursue knowledge ?<-->O
Ironically , is it not the imponderables that intrigue us ?<-->N
They exert a pull on our minds to seek answers to precisely those questions we are on the verge of forbidding .<-->N
Is this bringing us back to the message of the story of the garden of Eden of the Book of Genesis in the Bible : is there knowledge we are forbidden to seek ?<-->O
A Threat to Free Inquiry ?<-->N
Is this a dilemma ?<-->F
A `` catch-22 '' ?<-->N
Will prohibiting cloning of human beings cut us off from learning the answers to significant scientific information ?<-->O
Many argue that the research into the techniques of human cloning and the use of cloning technology are critical to advances that may lead to cures for many diseases .<-->O
For example , the use of cloning may allow us to develop ways to culture replacement tissues and bodily fluids that can be used to treat individuals without the usual difficulties of HLA matching and tissue rejection .<-->O
A somatic cell taken from a burn victim may be inserted into an oocyte and the process of cell division initiated to grow skin in tissue culture without the intent ever to create another human being .<-->O
So too for bone marrow , so vital for treating forms of cancer and immune deficiency diseases .<-->O
Nerve tissue can be developed in the same manner to be used to treat paralysis in accident or stroke victims without the problems of rejection of tissue and the complications of using immunosuppressive drugs .<-->O
It is not yet certain that such potential advances will actually occur .<-->O
But it is questionable how feasible they will be in practical application .<-->O
Obviously , at some early stage of life , even just after birth , somatic cells might be harvested and banked to be used if there was ever a therapeutic application for the individual whose cells would be preserved and reengineered in this way .<-->O
But the system for accomplishing this is impractical .<-->N
No matter where the somatic cells , however transformed and primed for therapeutic application , are stored , there are problems of availability at the point of need .<-->O
Even more problematic is the management of a storage and centralized system of reference to manage the process .<-->N
However , might the technology be used in an ad hoc way , case by case , to meet an individual patient 's needs ?<-->O
The prospect of cures like these is on the horizon .<-->N
But they do not require human cloning by SCNT to accomplish .<-->N
If the projections of scientists are correct , the techniques of embryonic and adult stem cell harvesting and transformation will yield a supply that can be universally available .<-->N
It will not be necessary to clone an individual 's own tissue via SCNT .<-->N
SCNT is a more complicated process with many more foreseeable logistical and technical problems .<-->N
The technology of stem cell development appears to present fewer problems and the prospect of more widespread uses and greater flexibility .<-->O
Potential Compassionate Applications Perhaps these are reasons enough to deemphasize human cloning through SCNT .<-->N
Even to abandon it .<-->N
But the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 places an absolute ban on the procedure .<-->N
Consequently , even humanitarian uses , out of compassion , are prohibited .<-->N
Advocates of human cloning through SCNT use the example of a couple whose child might be replaced through the use of SCNT .<-->N
For example , a young child is so severely injured that recovery is impossible , and the child lingers a brief time before dying in a comatose state .<-->O
A cell taken from the child could be inserted into the specially prepared ooctyte of the mother and implanted in her .<-->N
In this way , the child could be replicated as a replacement .<-->N
The parents would have regained their lost child .<-->N
A moving scenario , no doubt , even melodramatic , although we are very far from knowing how this situation would turn out .<-->O
For one thing , it seems much more natural to have another child .<-->N
The replacement may serve only to generate ambivalent feelings , and the child will bear a heavy burden , perhaps not loved for the distinct and separate individual he or she is .<-->O
Secondly , the harvesting of the oocytes is not straightforward .<-->N
It takes time because there is not likely to be a supply of these on hand from the same mother .<-->N
Thirdly , as we have learned from animal cloning , the technique has a minimal success rate .<-->N
Disappointment and failure are likely , and at best it is a prolonged process .<-->O
In making the decision to attempt cloning the lost child , the parents are acting under the strain of profound grief .<-->O
Their loss is keenly felt and their judgment affected by the tragic circumstances .<-->O
The doctor or research team required to carry out the procedure would need to divert their attention and resources to this set of tasks .<-->O
Unless the parents had enormous wealth so they could assemble their own team , the scenario is more in the realm of fiction than a realistic exercise .<-->O
Nor should we expect scientific research to channel itself to meet the rare occurrences of replacing children lost through tragedy .<-->O
However , cutting off research on human cloning through the technique of SCNT can cost us valuable knowledge of important benefit in another area : the treatment of infertility .<-->O
Thousands of couples in the United States are unable to bear children because their reproductive systems function poorly or not at all .<-->N
Assisted reproductive technology -LRB- ART -RRB- has been developed to remedy the condition .<-->N
Artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , drugs to stimulate ovulation , techniques of micro sperm extraction and direct injection into an ovum , and other techniques have been introduced successfully to treat human infertility .<-->O
Human cloning by means of SCNT offers a new method , giving hope to the thousands whose fundamental reproductive rights are thwarted by defects that can not be treated by these accepted methods .<-->O
For example , when the male is unable to produce sperm and the couple does not wish to use artificial insemination by a donor , cloning by SCNT would be an alternative .<-->O
The insertion of the male spouse 's nuclear DNA into the enucleated ovum of his wife allows the couple to have a child in a way that closely approximates a natural process of reproduction : the nuclear DNA , the ovum with the mitochondrial DNA of the woman , the implantation and natural process of pregnancy .<-->N
Prohibition of human cloning cuts off this avenue for individuals to exercise their fundamental reproductive rights .<-->N
A variant of this technique , in which the ovum of another woman is substituted for the ovum of the mother with a mitochondrial DNA defect and the nuclear DNA extracted from the fertilized embryo of the couple is inserted into the donated ovum , has been used with some success .<-->N
Therefore , does n't this prohibition interfere not just with the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake , but also run counter to the fundamental reproductive rights of individuals ?<-->O
The Ethics of Human Experimentation The argument that prohibiting human cloning through SCNT interferes with freedom of inquiry or impedes gaining knowledge essential to treating conditions that interfere with fundamental human reproductive rights overlooks an important consideration .<-->O
The quest for knowledge for its own sake or to benefit others is not unrestricted .<-->O
Ethical rules and codes govern the kinds of experimentation allowed on humans .<-->N
Harms are to be avoided ; risks must be minimized .<-->N
Worthy goals and hopes do not justify harmful procedures or those unlikely to produce reliable results .<-->O
Good intentions or claims of widespread benefits do not automatically redeem procedures of uncertain outcome .<-->O
In a phrase , the end does not justify the means .<-->N
The rules and codes for experimentation on humans are precise .<-->N
Those who propose to perform the experiments must provide evidence that the experiment can work ; that any harms it may cause can be avoided or limited ; that the expected outcomes are based on earlier work that allows an extrapolation to the proposed experiment , and that the experimental design is methodologically sound and well controlled .<-->O
It is not sufficient to cite lofty goals or pressing needs when experiments may entail costs of personal loss , distress , and harm to individuals or even significant risks for these harms .<-->O
Aircraft , vehicles , bridges , buildings , equipment are all designed with extra margins of safety and outfitted with safeguards as a fail safe to prevent harms .<-->O
Experiments that involve humans must also meet rigorous standards , including review by experts and by nonscientists , to meet the so-called sniff test .<-->O
No one contends that we know enough about SCNT as a technique in other mammalian species to try it out in humans .<-->O
Livestock with specially prized traits , laboratory animals with unique characteristics , the endangered species whose existence is imperiled if our cloning experiments fail or turn out to have unacceptable consequences , corrections are possible and unwanted outcomes can be disposed of .<-->O
Society does not permit such liberties with human life .<-->N
A breed of sheep or cattle that has unexpected flaws along with or instead of the sought after traits may still have other uses or can be euthanized and autopsied to understand the reasons for lack of success .<-->O
These options do not exist with the cloning of human beings , and therefore the prohibition from even beginning the process is necessary until the highest standards of safety and effectiveness can be demonstrated .<-->O
The Risks of Cloning Some advance the argument that human cloning may be premature at this time , but scientific progress might reach the point of removing or offsetting the risk .<-->O
However , prohibiting human cloning closes off the opportunity to ever reach the point of eliminating the possibility of failure or reducing it to acceptable levels .<-->O
Humanity would never have succeeded in reaching outer space or landing on the moon if the terms were elimination of all risk .<-->O
More to the point , there would be none of the cures , the vaccines , or the interventions of modern medicine if the advances needed to be free of risk .<-->O
Life is full of risks .<-->N
The achievements of humans could never have been made if the terms were `` risk free . ''<-->O
This argument has force .<-->N
But like many apparently persuasive arguments in favor of proceeding with human cloning , it obscures a feature of all the human achievements on which progress has been built .<-->O
Of course there were risks .<-->N
Those who accepted the challenge knew the risks and voluntarily accepted them .<-->O
Experimental human cloning is different .<-->N
The subjects in the cloning experiments are not only the healthy volunteers , for whom , after all , the risk is over once a cell is removed , once the oocytes are harvested and the pregnancy complete .<-->O
The subjects in cloning experiments are not high-minded adventurers , heroic explorers , dedicated scientists , not even the desperate terminally ill or grievously afflicted or those showing their altruism by joining researchers in the quest to relieve suffering through biomedical experimentation .<-->O
We recognize and appreciate the contributions and sacrifices that individuals make when they choose with a mind and voice of their own .<-->N
The risks of human cloning experimentation fall disproportionately on the clones .<-->N
And we who make the decisions on their behalf must think from what would be their point of view .<-->O
When flaws and failures turn up later , we can not point to the most fundamental precept for human experimentation : the well-informed and voluntary agreement of the individual to accept the risks , even those not currently foreseeable , and the freedom to quit the experiment when , in the individual 's sole judgment , the risks no longer seem acceptable .<-->O
This is the universal standard for human experimentation in the world today .<-->N
Who Decides ?<-->N
Human clones would of course have no opportunity to weigh the risks in advance .<-->N
Moreover , the flaws or risks are now incorporated into their very existence .<-->N
The inexorable outcome of the uncertainties or failures of the experiment determine their destiny .<-->O
Hence there is no voluntary agreement to accept the risks as a price of coming into existence and no opting out in the event the burdens seem no longer acceptable .<-->O
It is true that no human gets to choose to be born or to whom or under what circumstances .<-->N
We have no choice but to accept and make the most of the natural lottery of existence .<-->O
This is part of what defines being human .<-->N
For most individuals it is normal to honor and appreciate the choice our parents made for us in deciding to conceive and bring us into the world .<-->O
The same rules and codes of human experimentation noted earlier recognize the special and pivotal role of parents whenever medical research calls for children to be the experimental subjects .<-->N
Procedures are in place that reflect the universal assumption of law , policy , and common sense , that parents are best situated to make decisions in the best interests of their children .<-->O
There are even provisions to have checks and balances , should the situation suggest the parent -LRB- s -RRB- may not be guided by normal parental instincts .<-->O
In addition , by giving permission for experimentation on their children , parents are agreeing to accept the outcomes , even in the event that they are less than what was hoped for .<-->O
Experiments always have a degree of uncertainty .<-->N
Parents are free to withdraw their children from the research and children themselves may request that the experiment be terminated when they find they do not wish to continue .<-->N
Are There Reliable Safeguards ?<-->N
Inherent in the human cloning process is the unavoidable shifting of the burden of choice unequally to the clone , who is to be involuntarily recruited into the experiment with no chance to withdraw or to be withdrawn .<-->O
Once begun , the experiment has passed the point of no return .<-->N
Ideally , perhaps , an improved , even a fully perfected human cloning process ought to incorporate safeguards to detect potential flaws .<-->O
Some of these safeguards already exist .<-->N
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis -LRB- PGD -RRB- is a technique already available to screen embryos in vitro for a number of genetic diseases .<-->N
With the rapid growth of genetic technology , it is possible that one day most , if not all , genetic defects could be screened for and so no anomalies would occur in the clone .<-->O
Many other intrauterine techniques can detect developmental flaws during pregnancy .<-->N
Serious congenital defects and damage as well as inherited metabolic deficiencies can be detected at birth or shortly thereafter .<-->N
These problems can be managed in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice .<-->N
But so little is known at this time about the way the genome each individual 's genetic endowment works developmentally and functionally before and after birth that many deficiencies or disorders will only emerge after many years .<-->O
Evidence indicates that cells may have inherent in them a defined limit of passages : some reports claim Dolly the sheep is revealing indications of a more rapid cellular aging .<-->O
Success rates in animal cloning through SCNT are poor : most clones never reach or complete the gestation process , or they display major abnormalities during gestation or at birth .<-->O
The DNA of each individual has a complement of cellular mechanisms or switches that act to replicate cells at mitosis and to repair the damages to microscopic and molecular structures and processes essential to health , development , and survival .<-->O
Some evidence of genetic instability has been identified in mice clones and in cellular processes with cognate human processes .<-->N
More subtle differences in development or gene expression might only emerge from latency after years or in reaction to environmental influences , too late to detect or intercept .<-->O
Some scientists have offered the view that many of the more subtle effects in genetic structures may owe themselves to the sort of `` imprinting '' that takes place in the normal fertilization process .<-->O
At that point , meiosis II , initiated by the single sperm that triggers a succession of biochemical events , reaches completion .<-->N
Shortly thereafter , the events of embryonic development occur with the formation of the zygote and the beginning of cell division into daughter cells , each having the complement of DNA representing a component of each parent and with one set of the pair of parental genes becoming deactivated .<-->O
It is possible that subcellular events at this stage , currently not well described or identified , may play a decisive role in normal development .<-->O
Recent reports have emerged surrounding a process of SCNT in a variant of the model we have been discussing so far .<-->N
Scientists and clinicians have succeeded in overcoming defects in the mitochondrial DNA of women by the process of substituting a healthy oocyte from a donor for the oocyte with the deficiency .<-->N
The donated oocyte has the nucleus removed or deactivated .<-->N
Then the nucleus of an embryo , created in vitro with the sperm of the father and the mother 's ovum , is inserted in the donor 's enucleated ovum .<-->F
The reconstituted embryo is implanted in the uterus of the wife for normal gestation .<-->N
However , a number of the embryos thus created revealed signs of chromosomal defects , related to sex differentiation and mental retardation -LRB- Turner 's syndrome -RRB- .<-->N
More subtler forms of deficiencies could only be ruled out by the process of trial and error , an unacceptable method for human experimentation .<-->O
Thus the possibility of human cloning can not be demonstrated without a huge and , in large part , unacceptable cost , both personal and financial , to the individuals involved be they parents , the offspring , or the rest of society .<-->O
To advocate investment of public research funds or expect any public endorsement for the dim and distant prospect of , at best , a highly limited success with slight benefit and significant risks is not justifiable .<-->O
The Public Interest Even so , the recent bill approved by the U.S. House of Representatives is not limited to use of public funds .<-->N
It proscribes all efforts at human cloning by SCNT .<-->N
This must surely intrude on an area of scientific inquiry and reproductive rights .<-->O
Private funding and initiatives are banned .<-->N
How can this be justified ?<-->N
The reason is clear : this is an area that lawmakers have seen as a matter of public policy and profound public interest .<-->O
Over a decade ago , a federal law was passed , with no real controversy , prohibiting the sale and trafficking of human solid organs .<-->O
It was determined that it was against public policy and not in the public interest to have individuals sell their organs , even if they as donor and the recipient would stand to benefit from what is a lifesaving procedure .<-->O
The prospect of a commercialization of human organs was ruled to be against the public good .<-->O
Although cloning of human beings under private auspices is very different , still the authority of the Congress and federal government to prohibit what is detrimental to the public interest is clear .<-->O
Cloning of human beings is antithetical to the fundamental notions of what constitutes human conception .<-->O
The rationale for prohibiting human cloning is that it entails outright commodification of human embryos derived from laboratory manipulations and puts society at risk for the untoward results of flawed and unethical experimentation on humans .<-->O
It is not in the public interest to allow human cloning to go forward .<-->N
Proponents of human cloning rebut this view by arguing that it is based on the irrational fears of the so-called slippery slope argument .<-->O
This argument uses the logic that without an absolute prohibition of some possible course of action , society will by degrees move down so far that precedent after precedent we will incrementally reach a point no one ever wanted or foresaw , and it will then be impossible to turn back , just as if one step on the icy slope makes the fall inevitable .<-->O
The argument for prohibiting human cloning is not at all an instance of arguing based on slippery slope logic , however .<-->N
It is not that the possibility of misuses of human cloning or abuses to create `` novel human beings '' or to replicate outstanding or favored types of human beings is what induces the prohibition .<-->O
It is not just to rule out looming science fiction scenarios .<-->O
The prohibition of human cloning through the process of SCNT is based on a thorough understanding and appreciation of the methodology of scientific experimentation .<-->O
The experimental method proceeds by a process of trial and error .<-->N
A hypotheses is formed .<-->N
Data are gathered that either support or fail to support the hypothesis .<-->O
Based on better data and clearer objectives garnered through the first experiment , new hypotheses are developed and the steps repeated .<-->O
The result is greater accuracy and precision in the hypothesis or improved data collection .<-->N
Or it leads to abandonment of the hypothesis as fundamentally flawed and not worth pursuing .<-->O
The prohibition of human cloning is a declaration that efforts to engineer human embryos or beings in this way is off-limits to the method of trial and error .<-->N
In effect , it is the rejection of a fundamentally flawed hypothesis .<-->O
Conclusion In experimentation on human beings , the basic principles of human society apply .<-->N
There must be a reasonable likelihood of an unequivocal outcome , not some 1 % to 3 % limited success rate with failures and successes allowing incremental advances at intolerable cost .<-->O
We can only proceed based on thorough preliminary research and sound scientific design , and at this point the evidence seems to be leading in a direction away from the attempt at human cloning .<-->O
Harms are to be avoided and risks minimized .<-->N
But it is not possible to foresee the harms or risks , and it is impossible to reverse them should we discover them later .<-->O
There is no turning back if we are unsuccessful .<-->N
There is no opportunity to quit the experiment if the subject so decides .<-->O
The test is not whether we should allow human cloning on the premise that useful information or some possible benefit may emerge .<-->O
The test is to adhere to the standards for human experimentation that have been developed and refined over the past 50 years and codified in a succession of declarations , pronouncements , and laws by governmental and international bodies throughout the world .<-->N
The burden of proof for meeting these standards falls on those who propose to clone human beings by SCNT .<-->N
CHARLES MACKAY Viewpoint : No , the cloning of human beings should not be prohibited because the potential for medical accidents or malfeasance is grossly overstated , and the ethical questions raised by detractors are not unique to cloning indeed , ethical questions attend every scientific advancement .<-->O
Every generation confronts moral , ethical , legal , and political problems regarding the appropriate use of new technology and the limits of scientific research .<-->O
Which is to say , every generation confronts the problems that attend to the new knowledge and understanding about our world that such technology and research affords .<-->O
At the same time , however , societies continue to promote the advancement of the science and research that makes possible such new technologies and the societal advances they facilitate .<-->O
This essay attempts to demystify the cloning process and demonstrate how cloning , both in its reproductive and therapeutic capacities , provides much needed and sought after answers to otherwise intractable medical problems and conditions .<-->O
As it turns out , the fears and ethical concerns regarding the cloning of humans -LRB- or even human embryos -RRB- that have moved many , including the U.S. Congress , to favor an absolute prohibition on human simply are unfounded .<-->O
Indeed , many of the fears regarding cloning are not novel to human cloning ; they are the same fears of the unknown that generally are raised more out of naive , knee-jerk reactions to new scientific procedures than well-thought-out , empirically supported assessments .<-->O
On all fronts , the fears regarding human cloning can be allayed .<-->N
In light of the many benefits human cloning can provide , it would be foolish to prohibit by law the cloning of human beings or human embryos .<-->O
This is not to say we should ignore the many ethical and legal issues , as well as other potential problems , that cloning humans may create , but rather , it simply is to recognize that human cloning per se is not the moral monstrosity that many are making it out to be .<-->O
There is , however , an overlap between the issues of human cloning and abortion , discussed in more detail later .<-->N
Consequently , those who are morally opposed to abortion may also be morally opposed to human cloning , at least its therapeutic aspect .<-->N
Many will continue to believe that human cloning is inherently morally unjustified , if not evil , for the same reasons they believe abortion is inherently immoral : both abortion and cloning of human embryos for medical research involves the destruction of -LRB- at least -RRB- potential life .<-->O
Of course , whether human embryos are deserving of the same respect as a viable human fetus depends on personal definitions of what constitutes life and the scope of certain protections and this invariably is the point where moral intuitions clash .<-->O
Rather than attempting the futile enterprise of rearranging the moral intuitions of others , this essay explains first that cloning essentially is just another method of reproduction .<-->O
Second , related to this first point , it demonstrates a common reoccurrence in the history of science and technology , namely , the presence of what could be called the `` offensive factor , '' which tends to accompany new scientific and technological breakthroughs .<-->O
Although initially the majority of people may view these breakthroughs with disdain , in time , that same majority comes to accept them .<-->O
New Technology and New Ideas : Overcoming the Offensive Factor As with virtually any new scientific advancement , there are a range of opinions on the issue of human cloning , from those that are morally opposed to it on religious grounds -LRB- e.g. , the Catholic church -RRB- , to , somewhat ironically , those that are in favor of it also on religious grounds -LRB- e.g. , the Raelians , a religious order begun in the early 1970s in France that claims 55,000 members throughout the world ; in 1997 the Raelians founded Clonaid , a company that conducts human cloning experiments -RRB- .<-->O
The majority view , however , appears to be strongly opposed to the idea of cloning humans .<-->O
That is not surprising .<-->N
Indeed , throughout history , we can find many examples where a society initially condemned , or even was repulsed , by a new scientific practice or idea , although it would later come to accept and even embrace it .<-->O
The performance of autopsies , organ donation , and the use of robots in manufacturing are but a few examples .<-->N
Indeed , in the early 1970s , when in vitro fertilization -LRB- IVF -RRB- began on human beings , many in society including medical professionals opposed it vehemently on moral and ethical grounds .<-->O
A doctor involved in one of the first IVF procedures was so appalled by the procedure that he deliberately destroyed the fertilized embryo because he thought the process was against nature .<-->O
Now , of course , IVF clinics are so commonplace that the birth of so-called test-tube babies no longer are newsworthy events , and few , if any , contemporary medical professionals claim that IVF procedures are immoral , unethical , or should be prohibited .<-->O
For a more current example , witness the Internet .<-->N
Although the Internet has greatly improved the exchange of information and ideas , it also has facilitated cybercrime and other economic crimes , and it has made it easier for individuals to engage in such illicit activities , which pose extreme threats to the security of nations and the stability of global markets .<-->O
Does the fact that even a single individual could cause widespread damage mean we should dismantle the entire Internet ?<-->O
Few would agree , and the billions that benefit from and rely on its existence would undoubtedly fight such efforts .<-->O
Indeed , in today 's interconnected world , dismantling the Internet probably would be impossible .<-->N
Thus when new technology and new ideas spring forth , it often is difficult , if not impossible , to prevent their propagation .<-->N
The `` new '' generally has both aspects of the `` good '' as well as the `` bad . ''<-->O
But the bad should not necessarily deny us the benefits of the good .<-->O
Therefore , rather than futilely attempting to prevent human cloning because of the evils that might spring from it , we should , as we have done with other new technologies and ideas , embrace it for the benefits and new knowledge that will emanate from it , all the while doing the best we can to minimize abuses .<-->O
Otherwise , we risk driving the cloning of humans underground , and that could be a far worse evil .<-->O
To be sure , many moral , ethical , and legal issues must be addressed with respect to cloning humans , not the least of which concerns the possibility that cloning humans will open a market for `` designer babies , '' which could lead to eugenics .<-->O
Again , the potential for abuse always accompanies the advent of new technology .<-->O
Although human cloning now may be perceived as something bizarre and foreign to us , within a generation perhaps even earlier cloning humans will be as noncontroversial as IVF , surrogate motherhood , and organ transplantation .<-->O
So while we grow accustomed to the new technology and knowledge that human cloning may bring , there simply is no good reason why human cloning should be prohibited , but there are many reasons discussed later why research in the area should continue .<-->O
And while research continues , we can work toward addressing the ethical issues regarding human cloning by developing professional codes of conduct and governmental regulation where necessary in order to minimize potential abuse , just as we did regarding organ transplantation and initial fears that organ transplantation would create black markets in organs .<-->O
The problem , then , is not the technology per se , but how we use that technology .<-->N
What Is Human Cloning ?<-->N
Perhaps the most significant impediment to new technology and ideas is that few people understand exactly what they are at first , and these misunderstandings breed fear and contempt .<-->O
First and foremost , human cloning is not anything like photocopying oneself .<-->O
For example , let 's say Jackie A , a 30-year-old female , decides to clone herself .<-->N
If she wants to `` replicate '' herself so there will be another 30-year-old female we call this replicant Jackie B that looks identical to her , Jackie A will be disappointed .<-->O
Literally replicating oneself physically is impossible , and it is not what is meant by human cloning .<-->N
But Jackie A could do exactly what scientists in Scotland did with Dolly the sheep .<-->N
Known as somatic cell nuclear transfer -LRB- SCNT -RRB- , a doctor would first remove a mature but unfertilized egg from Jackie A or utilize one from a donor .<-->N
The doctor then would remove the egg 's nucleus , which only would have 23 chromosomes , half the necessary amount for human reproduction , and replace it with the nucleus of another cell a somatic cell , which would have a full complement of 46 chromosomes .<-->O
As we have assumed , if Jackie A wished to clone herself , the somatic cell simply would come from Jackie A .<-->N
The egg with the new nucleus then would be chemically treated so it would behave as if it had been fertilized .<-->O
Once the egg begins to divide , it then would be transferred into Jackie A 's uterus , initiating pregnancy .<-->N
Essentially , except for the nuclear transfer , the procedure is identical to now common IVF procedures .<-->N
If all goes well , within approximately nine months , Jackie A will give birth to a daughter an infant daughter , to be sure who is genetically identical to Jackie A. Thus Jackie A has `` cloned '' herself .<-->O
Jackie A 's daughter , whom we have named Jackie B , is not a `` replicant , '' but a completely separate individual she will not share any of Jackie B 's memories or consciousness , just as a child does not share any such traits of its parents .<-->O
Jackie B , however , will grow up to look nearly identical to Jackie A inasmuch as she shares all of Jackie A 's genetic identity .<-->O
The `` odd '' part is that not only is Jackie B the daughter of Jackie A , but Jackie B also is Jackie A 's genetic twin sister .<-->N
Some people may find this result a bit unsettling inasmuch as it appears to be quite unusual or `` unnatural '' how can someone be both a daughter and a sister to her mother ?<-->O
First , whether we refer to someone as a sister , mother , brother , or father often turns not on genetic or biological relationships but on other social conditions and relationships .<-->N
Adopted children , for example , do not share any of the genetic features of their adoptive parents , yet they still are recognized as the children and heirs of their parents .<-->N
We speak of adopted children 's birth parents as opposed to their -LRB- adoptive -RRB- parents to make such a distinction .<-->N
Similarly , in light of the phenomenon of surrogate motherhood , merely because someone is born from a particular woman does not necessarily mean that same woman is even the individual 's biological mother : a surrogate mother could simply be a woman who has agreed to carry the fertilized egg of another woman .<-->O
As a result , in such situations the child born to the surrogate mother shares none of the surrogate mother 's genetic material .<-->N
Thus familial relations no longer are simply a matter of biology and genetics , but more a matter of social constructions .<-->O
Second , sometimes even in nature we can witness so-called unnatural results .<-->O
If your mother , for example , is an identical twin , then her twin , of course , is your aunt .<-->N
But , interestingly enough , she also is your genetic mother in the sense that genetically speaking , she is identical to your mother .<-->N
In such a situation , your aunt genetically speaking both is your aunt and your mother .<-->N
Of course , we do not really consider your aunt to also be your mother merely because she is genetically identical to your mother .<-->O
That would be silly .<-->N
Your mother is your mother by virtue of the fact that she bore and reared you -LRB- although , as we discussed earlier , giving birth to someone does not necessarily mean the child and mother are genetically related -RRB- .<-->O
Likewise , it would be absurd to seriously consider Jackie A 's daughter to also be her sister merely because she is genetically identical to Jackie A. Why Should We Clone at All ?<-->O
As of this writing , it is unknown whether human cloning actually could be performed today .<-->N
It also is unclear whether it already has occurred .<-->N
What is evident , however , is that if human cloning is not technologically feasible now , it certainly is theoretically possible , and , once the procedures are refined , likely will occur soon .<-->O
Indeed , in addition to the Raelians , Severino Antinori a controversial fertility doctor from Italy has announced publicly that he will be going forward with implanting cloned human embryos in volunteers shortly .<-->N
Whether these experiments will be successful remains to be seen , but if they are , the first cloned human may be born in the summer of 2002 .<-->N
In light of this -LRB- temporary -RRB- uncertainty with respect to the feasibility of successfully cloning a human , many opponents of human cloning argue in favor of a moratorium on human cloning .<-->O
Such opponents point out that the process by which to clone mammals , let alone humans , is not yet perfected and could result in severely malformed and stillborn children .<-->O
Certainly these are valid worries that can not be ignored .<-->N
Unfortunately , such worries can not be resolved via a moratorium , for how can the necessary science advance if no research is being performed ?<-->O
Experimentation can be performed without impregnating human females of course .<-->N
But just as there had to be a first heart transplant patient , there will have to be a first cloned embryo implanted into a woman if human cloning ever is to be achieved .<-->O
There are always risks .<-->N
The point of research is to minimize them , and a moratorium simply misses that point .<-->O
In any event , what follows with regard to human cloning assumes that the science will , if not now , eventually be perfected so these worries about malformations and stillbirths -LRB- both of which occur naturally anyway , lest we forget -RRB- can be greatly reduced .<-->O
Assuming that human cloning will not present such dangers to either the child or the mother , there still remains the question of why we would want to clone humans at all .<-->O
Reproductive Cloning .<-->N
As already mentioned , human cloning essentially is a method for asexual reproduction .<-->N
As such , it can allow infertile couples or even single persons to reproduce offspring that are biologically related to them .<-->O
A husband who no longer is able to produce sperm nevertheless still could have a biological heir by implanting his DNA into the egg of his wife -LRB- or , if the couple so choose , a surrogate -RRB- .<-->O
Likewise , via human cloning , a single woman , a single man , or even same-sex couples would be able to reproduce biologically related heirs .<-->O
Adoption always is an option for such persons , but for some , the desire for biologically related children is a more attractive option .<-->O
Essentially , then , human cloning makes available the possibility of reproduction to those who otherwise would be unable to reproduce .<-->O
The imagination can run wild with the possibilities that cloning humans for reproductive purposes provides .<-->N
For instance , a couple 's child dies in a horrific accident and they no longer are able to conceive a child .<-->N
They are devastated .<-->N
Would it be unethical of them to clone the child ?<-->N
Certainly , if they believe the cloned child will be just like their deceased child .<-->O
They should be disabused of their misconception .<-->N
The cloned child will be a completely new person even though it will look just like the deceased child .<-->O
The parents can not bring their deceased child back to life .<-->N
Even if they understand that , is there still a problem with them wanting another child to replace the one they have lost ?<-->O
Similarly , assume the same couple has a child dying of a terminal disease in need of a bone marrow transplant .<-->O
No donors can be found .<-->N
Some couples have , in fact , conceived children for the purpose of actually creating a possible donor for their dying child -LRB- which creates ethical issues of its own -RRB- .<-->O
Unfortunately , the new child may not necessarily be a good match for the dying child .<-->O
Thus would it be unethical for the couple instead to clone their dying child in order to use the marrow from the clone who necessarily will be a perfect match to save their dying child ?<-->O
In effect , in order to save the child 's life , the couple simply would be reproducing their child 's twin .<-->N
Finally , cloning raises the specter of eugenics , which many associate with Nazi Germany and those who promote beliefs in racial supremacy .<-->N
With cloning , we could `` breed '' superior humans who are smarter .<-->O
Certainly , so-called designer babies would be possible with cloning .<-->O
If that bothers us , however , we could impose specific restrictions on the cloning of humans and create a regulatory and enforcement body to oversee such procedures , just like we have done with organ donation .<-->O
And just as importantly , we can inform those who are interested in cloning themselves , or a relative , or a friend , about what cloning actually is and clear up any misconceptions they might have about the procedure .<-->O
In short , it is possible to define appropriate and inappropriate uses for cloning just as we have for a variety of other new medical procedures .<-->O
Merely because some might abuse cloning should not preclude others from otherwise benefiting from the cloning procedure .<-->O
Therapeutic Cloning .<-->N
Unlike reproductive cloning , therapeutic cloning does not involve reproduction , but the initial process is the same .<-->F
A human embryo is cloned not to produce a child , but in order to retrieve its stem cells .<-->F
Stem cells are unique in that they can be `` grown '' into virtually any type of cell in the body .<-->N
According to some researchers , stem cell research may provide breakthroughs in the treatment of spinal cord injury and repair and a way to overcome the debilitating effects of many neurological disorders .<-->O
Because stem cells can be cultivated into the tissue of any organs , they also suggest a way for doctors to avoid the problems of organ transplantation .<-->O
Often the patient 's body receiving the organ rejects it .<-->N
As a result , the patient must be given high doses of anti-rejection drugs .<-->O
The same problems hold true for artificial organs .<-->O
But anti-rejection drugs often have severe side effects .<-->N
In addition to these problems , far more patients are in need of organs than are available .<-->O
These patients often must wait for long periods of time , sometimes years , for an available organ and then hope the organ is not rejected by the body .<-->O
Very often , such patients die just waiting for the organ .<-->O
Using stem cells to cultivate new organs would alleviate both these problems .<-->O
First , because the organ simply would be cloned from the patient 's DNA , the patient 's body likely would not reject the organ for it essentially is the same organ from the perspective of the body .<-->O
Second , there would be no waiting list for the patient .<-->N
Whenever a new organ is needed , the patient 's doctor would clone the needed organ from the patient .<-->O
So what possibly could be the problem with therapeutic cloning in light of these potential benefits ?<-->O
The retrieval of stem cells requires destroying the embryo .<-->N
Note that stem cells can also be retrieved from adult cells , rather than embryos .<-->N
However , whether such adult stem cells are as effective as embryonic stem cells still is an open question .<-->O
Because of this , some religious groups are morally opposed to therapeutic cloning for the same reason they are morally opposed to abortion : they consider the embryo to be a human being -LRB- or , at least , with the potential for life -RRB- , and therefore the destruction of the embryo is unjustified even if it will save the life of another .<-->O
Whether Americans consider an embryo to be a human being certainly is a matter of debate .<-->O
According to an August 14 , 2001 , Gallup poll , only 36 % of Americans believe that embryos deserve the same protection as human life .<-->O
The same poll revealed that more than 70 % of Americans think research on stem cells is necessary including , surprisingly , 31 % who think that stem cell research is morally wrong .<-->O
In light of this , it certainly appears that such moral objections do not dissuade most Americans from the importance of stem cell research .<-->O
In contrast , a June 27 , 2001 , Gallup poll revealed that 89 % of Americans are opposed to reproductive cloning .<-->N
Evidently , therapeutic cloning is not as offensive as reproductive cloning .<-->N
Conclusion Human cloning essentially is human reproduction nothing more , nothing less .<-->N
How it is performed and the results that may follow , however , are new .<-->N
This is where the offensive factor mentioned earlier comes in .<-->N
As with other new technologies and new ideas that have been fostered by scientific research , we need to -LRB- and hopefully will -RRB- , get beyond the repugnance we feel about human cloning .<-->O
Recently , the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 -LRB- H.R. 2505 -RRB- , and this legislation currently is being considered by the Senate .<-->N
The act will make the cloning of human embryos a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a civil penalty of at least $ 1 million .<-->O
Whether such legislation will become law is uncertain as of this writing , but undeniably the genie is out of the bottle the technology already exists .<-->O
Such legislation , most likely enacted out of political expediency in the face of the offensive factor , likely will do little to prevent determined researchers and advocates of human cloning from going forward with experimentation abroad .<-->O
Given that religious views often govern and guide our feelings toward such new technologies and new ideas , we return to the events surrounding what arguably was the first instance of cloning : God 's creation of Eve from a rib of Adam .<-->O
After their creation , both Adam and Eve were instructed by God not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge on pain of death .<-->O
Tempted by a serpent , however , Eve disobeyed God by eating the fruit and offered it to Adam .<-->N
By eating the fruit , both Adam and Eve suddenly became aware of their surroundings ; they had acquired new knowledge .<-->O
Afraid they would soon eat the fruit of the Tree of Life and thereby become immortal , God quickly banished them from the Garden of Eden `` lest they become like one of Us . ''<-->N
Traditionally , the tale of Adam and Eve is thought to represent the first instance of sin , the `` original sin , '' and the consequences that flowed from that sin .<-->O
But there is another way to interpret their story .<-->N
The serpent , after all , tempted Eve by informing her that should she eat of the Tree of Knowledge her eyes would be opened , and she would come to know right from wrong .<-->O
In essence , it was this fact a craving for new knowledge that moved Eve to disobey God 's command and risk death .<-->O
Although many take the moral of the story to concern the ramifications of disobeying the command of God , we also can see that it represents the ramifications of new knowledge .<-->O
Eve , who essentially was the first scientist , sought out new knowledge , and like some of the millions of scientists who have followed her , also suffered some severe consequences .<-->O
Thus new knowledge always comes at a price , but what is the alternative ?<-->N
Human cloning should not be prohibited because of the new knowledge it affords its abuse , of course , should be .<-->O
Cloning humans has recently become a possibility that seems much more feasible in today 's society than it was twenty years ago .<-->O
The process used in cloning has been practiced on livestock for quite a few years with good results .<-->N
The techniques have been proven to work , and with the rapid growth of technology in this field , human cloning can one day be very beneficial to our society .<-->O
Human cloning has potential to save lives and make better the quality of life for future generations .<-->O
This is why human cloning should not be banned .<-->N
Many people who oppose this viewpoint are mostly misinformed about cloning .<-->O
Television , books , radio , and people 's own imagination have given the practice of cloning a bad stereotype .<-->O
The main opposing argument is that clones will not have any uniqueness or personality of their own and that they will grow up to be just like their donors .<-->O
This is where many people are wrong .<-->N
Nature has been producing clones for millions of years through the process of identical twins .<-->N
Identical twins have the same genetic makeup of each other , yet develop into separate individuals with distinct personalities -LRB- Cole -RRB- .<-->N
This shows that genetic makeup does not play a big role in our individuality , but that our individuality comes from our environment .<-->O
Bioethicist Gregory E. Pence argues that each clone would be different because as a fetus it would be exposed to many different chemical and nutritional influences that would alter the way the brain responds to stimuli -LRB- qtd .<-->O
in Roylance -RRB- .<-->N
This shows that human clones will have their own identity .<-->N
`` Identity is uniqueness , not sameness , '' explains Stanford philosopher John Perry , who specializes in the study of identity , `` Identical twins are not identical , but only the same , and there is a major difference '' -LRB- qtd .<-->N
in Cole -RRB- .<-->N
Cloning is exampled in Magill 's Survey of Science as combining bits and pieces of DNA from different sources and combining them in bacteria .<-->N
We have come a long way since cloning bits and pieces of bacteria .<-->N
This has given scientist practice to start on larger organisms such as humans .<-->N
Here are some of the most beneficial ways in which cloning can help humans .<-->O
Human cloning could provide our society with an answer to the shortage of organ donation .<-->N
We could have an immediate supply of many organs , tissues , and blood types without the wait of someone else dying in order to receive them .<-->O
No longer would a mother have to tell her dying child that he will have to wait for a bone marrow transplant .<-->O
Once the cloning of a cell has been done and the cell has begun to divide , it does not necessarily have to develop into an entire person .<-->O
The cells would be controlled so that they mature into specialized cells or even complete organs .<-->O
There would be no rejection from the body since the cloned cells would have the same DNA as the donor -LRB- Nash -RRB- .<-->O
Another possible medical advance that could be developed through cloning research is the diagnosis and even curing of genetic diseases such as diabetes .<-->O
Before the embryo is implanted it could be analyzed for genes that cause diseases such as cystic fibrosis , Tay-Sachs , and diabetes to name a few .<-->N
This procedure is already being used in other countries such as England .<-->N
This way an embryo with the highest chance of good health and survival could be selected for implantation .<-->O
This could rid our society of genetic defects for our children to produce longer living and healthier humans for the future -LRB- Benot -RRB- .<-->N
The most poignant argument in favor of human cloning would be to help couples that can not conceive a child naturally .<-->O
There are many couples in this world which can not pass on their genes for the purpose of procreation .<-->N
Pence says that human cloning would give them a chance to give birth to a child that is genetically related to them .<-->N
Using in vitro fertilization to produce embryos and then cloning those embryos would give a couple more chances to produce offspring .<-->N
This way the parents can be assured that their genes will be passed on to future generations -LRB- qtd .<-->N
in Roylance -RRB- .<-->N
Dr. Richard Seed envisions a cure for cancer through cloning .<-->N
Cancerous cells look normal in the early stage of the disease , then later become deformed .<-->O
We could take early cancerous cells and replace their destructive nuclei with a nucleus cloned from a normal cell , thus stopping cancer before it has a chance to keep spreading -LRB- qtd .<-->O
in Weingarten -RRB- .<-->N
We can also duplicate genes from the past .<-->F
The DNA does not have to be from a living human .<-->N
Every cell has the same genetic blueprint as another , therefore we could clone anyone from the past , as long as their DNA was preserved .<-->O
Human cloning could assist in recreating cultures that were lost in history , such as the ones lost during times of genocide -LRB- Vere -RRB- .<-->O
We could also regenerate the lost links between man and ape to see how ancient man might have really looked like .<-->O
We would be able to help preserve endangered species like the African Rhino from becoming extinct by cloning them and setting them free in the wild without the need for protection .<-->O
This way our children would not have to see pictures of extinct animals , but pet them in zoos .<-->N
It is evident that human cloning has immense potential to better humanity .<-->O
Only research will lead to its improvement and perfection .<-->O
To ban this research will result in the loss of a technology that will someday cure diseases , prevent deaths , and give infertile couples a chance to have a child of their own .<-->O
Which action , banning or not banning , is really the less ethical choice ?<-->O
To let this technology slip through our fingers would prevent us from improving the quality of life for all of humanity .<-->O
This is why human cloning should not be banned .<-->N
Reasons For and Against Human Cloning Recently , the controversy around human cloning has received a lot of news coverage ; yet unsurprisingly , a clear and thorough examination of both sides has been lacking from the news media .<-->O
Basically , human cloning is the artificial process of making a genetic twin of a person .<-->N
This means a person could literally become the parent of their own twin sibling or the parent of anyone s twin .<-->N
Scientists are either very close at being able to clone human beings , or scientists have already done so .<-->O
Human cloning has already become illegal or restricted in a variety of degrees in several countries , thus scientific research has been greatly reduced throughout the world .<-->O
Furthermore , there has been quite a bit of legislation proposing to completely ban human cloning , and a large amount of legislation proposing to allow human cloning .<-->O
Unfortunately , I have not seen or heard a holistic explanation of both sides with all the reasons for and against human cloning , so I am going to list all the reasons that I ve found so far .<-->O
Additionally , I am going to address each of these issues on their rational merit .<-->O
Reasons for allowing human cloning : Infertility : In my opinion , if a couple is unable to conceive a child , then there are plenty of children in orphanages and foster care that could use a home and family .<-->O
Adopting an orphan is much easier , cheaper , virtuous , and safer solution than trying to clone a human being , not including helping a child in need .<-->O
Genetic Illness : If a person chooses not to have a child that is genetically their own because of a risk with passing on a genetic illness , then again adoption is a better solution for the reasons mentioned previously .<-->O
Vanity : Bringing a child into the world should not about our narcissism , vanity , or an attempt at indirect immortality , because we are all unfairly biased for ourselves and our genes .<-->O
Super Humans : Selecting the most perfect genetic donor in someone s opinion , whether it is Albert Einstein , Michael Jordan , or some other above average person , changes the norms of society .<-->O
Imagine a world with fewer variations of people who are either super-geniuses or super-athletes .<-->N
On the other hand , advances in science and technology would grow at an even faster rate and more people would be healthier .<-->O
I judge this purpose as a sufficiently good enough reason for allowing human cloning ; however , I am very suspicious of intentionally making a better race of people .<-->O
Maybe I ve seen too many science fiction movies .<-->N
Curing Diseases : The growing scientific field known as regenerative medicine , also known as therapeutic cloning , is allowing thousands of lives to be saved from cloning human cells , tissues , and even organs .<-->N
Cloning human body parts guarantees a genetic match to prevent organ rejections and also does not require immunosuppressive drugs .<-->N
However , this research is still in its infancy and requires a lot more time , effort , and money before it matures into saving a lot more people .<-->N
If human cloning is completely banned , then this type of research would be stopped and a lot of lives would be lost .<-->O
Therefore , this type of human cloning should also be allowed .<-->N
Body Replacements : One of the stranger reasons for cloning humans is for a complete body replacement .<-->N
This is only science fiction now , yet it may some day be a possibility in the distant future .<-->N
While it will always unethical to kill another human being to save another person , what if the cloned human body replacement did not have a brain and was intentionally designed that way from the beginning ?<-->O
What about replacing an aged body with a new body by transplanting the human brain ?<-->N
I 'll leave these ethical and fuzzy questions to be answered by the reader .<-->N
Because We Can : Just because science gives humanity the ability to do something does not mean that humankind should .<-->O
The reasons for doing any action must out weigh the reasons for not doing the action , therefore cloning a person should not be because of capability .<-->O
Reasons for banning human cloning : Playing God : Whether playing God or playing Devil , I find this reason without any logic what so ever .<-->N
Mankind is already `` playing '' God when we cure diseases , fly airplanes , create nuclear energy , or use any advanced technology .<-->N
Religion : I believe it is impossible for anyone to know the true intentions of God if God exists .<-->O
I don t think God in any religion has directly banned human cloning .<-->N
I know that the Catholic Pope is against cloning , but I find that at odds with being fruitful and multiplying .<-->O
Determining Gender : In some societies , being able to determine the sex , whether it is a boy or girl , is very important .<-->O
While I believe that pre-determining the sex of a child is not applicable in modern society , I find no logically moral reasons why this should be banned .<-->O
Sexual Orientation : Some people want to ban human cloning because they believe this is the only method that homosexuals can have children that will most likely be homosexual too .<-->O
I believe that this reason is caused by fear from ignorance and religion and therefore logically baseless .<-->O
On the other hand , I believe that if same sex couples want a child , then adoption should be a better option as mentioned above .<-->O
Sub-Human : Imagine a new race of people that are docile with super strength yet low intelligence .<-->O
Next , imagine how easily for this race to fall into slavery .<-->O
Cloning humans should be for the advancement of mankind and not the lessening of individuals .<-->N
Embryos at Risk : The process of human cloning increases the risk of harm to embryos and thus to the cloned person throughout their life .<-->O
This reason is self defeating ; because as scientists learn more , cloning humans has the possibility of becoming safer than naturally developing embryos by replacing randomized risks and genetic defects .<-->O
Embryos Killed : During the human cloning process , a lot of human embryos are created and tested for viability .<-->N
Some are either discarded or frozen for future use .<-->N
First , it is heavily debated if killing a human embryo that is only a few living cells is murdering a person .<-->N
I don t think this argument will ever be decided upon .<-->O
Second , extra embryos can be frozen , so they can avoid being killed too .<-->O
Third , embryos can also be used in stem cell research , and thus possibly save human lives .<-->N
And finally with further research , it could be possible to decrease the number of embryos created to only a single embryo .<-->O
Expectations : Expectations of cloned humans to be identical to the genetic original person would undoubtedly cause a lot of psychological pressure , especially while growing up .<-->O
Since identical twins are genetically the same yet very different people , it is unwise to expect cloned people to behave or have the same intelligence as the original genetic person .<-->O
Therefore , no one should have any expectations from cloned people .<-->N
Human Rights : A lot of people worry that cloned people would not have full rights , since they are just copies .<-->O
I find this reasoning absolutely ridiculous , since a person is a person despite their genetic source or if artificially created .<-->O
As you can see , I think each and every reason to ban human cloning was logically contradicted or challenged .<-->N
Even most of the reasons to allow human cloning were opposed too .<-->O
However , it is only because of the possible medical advances and the possible advantages to the human race that human cloning should be allowed .<-->O
Just the research of human cloning alone could save a great many lives .<-->N
Human Cloning Should be Illegal Can you imagine a world where everyone looked the same and had the same DNA ?<-->N
This could become true due to the advances in science in the field of cloning .<-->N
We are coming into an age where scientists have started cloning non-human mammals as well as fish .<-->N
Soon , they will want to start cloning humans .<-->O
Since human cloning is so dangerous , unethical , and too expensive for reproductive purposes , it should be illegal .<-->O
Human cloning is dangerous .<-->N
It is estimated that between 95 and 98 percent of cloning experiments have failed -LRB- Genetics and Society -RRB- .<-->F
These downfalls to cloning are in the form of miscarriages and stillbirths -LRB- Genetics and Society -RRB- .<-->N
Cloned human beings also run the risk of having severe genetic abnormalities .<-->O
Children cloned from adult DNA would , in a sense , already have old genes .<-->N
These children s main problem would be developing and growing old too quickly .<-->O
This includes arthritis , appearance , and organ function .<-->N
Since the chance of having a child with mental and physical problems is so much higher than that of a normally conceived child , cloning should be illegal .<-->O
Human cloning is also unethical .<-->N
Cloning , especially therapeutic cloning , requires the use of human embryos .<-->N
Using these embryos would mean killing unborn children .<-->O
Therapeutic cloning begins by removing the stem cells from an embryo -LRB- Human Cloning -RRB- .<-->N
The stem cells are used to grow bone , nerve , and muscle tissue .<-->N
In the process of therapeutic cloning , an embryo , or a baby in the early stages of development , is taken and parts of it are grown to develop parts of the body including organs and limbs -LRB- Human Cloning -RRB- .<-->N
Removing these stem cells would kill the embryo .<-->N
The embryo , which would result in a child if left in the mother s womb , is separated into parts , which are used for science .<-->N
Finally , human cloning for reproductive purposes is too expensive .<-->N
The cost to clone one human could be more than $ 100,000 -LRB- Herper -RRB- .<-->N
That is extremely high considering the cost of in vitro fertilization .<-->N
In vitro fertilization costs between $ 3,500 and $ 25,000 depending on the procedure -LRB- Advanced Fertility Services -RRB- .<-->N
If someone could not become pregnant it is much more likely that they would chose to use fertilization and be guaranteed a healthy , normal child rather than spend the money to clone a child that could have defects .<-->O
With fertilization costing only one fourth of cloning , why would someone choose to clone ?<-->N
The world is not ready for genetically engineered children .<-->N
Human cloning is too dangerous at this time for scientists and doctors to be able to clone humans effectively .<-->O
It is also unethical in the sense that it requires the use of the stem cells from embryos , leaving the embryos dead .<-->O
Lastly , with it costing four times as much as in vitro fertilization , cloning is too expensive right now for reproductive purposes .<-->O
Therefore , with all of the drawbacks of cloning , why not make it illegal ?<-->N
Should we clone human beings ?<-->N
Cloning as a source oftissue for transplantation When news broke in 1997 that Ian Wilmut and his colleagues had successfully cloned an adult sheep , there was an ill-informed wave of public , professional and bureaucratic fear and rejection of the new technique .<-->O
Almost universally , human cloning was condemned .<-->N
`` 4 Germany , Denmark and Spain have legislation banning cloning ; Norway , Slovakia , Sweden and Switzerland have legislation implicitly banning cloning .7 Some states in Australia , such as Victoria , ban cloning .<-->N
There are two bills before congress in the US which would comprehensively ban it .89 There is no explicit or implicit ban on cloning in England , Greece , Ireland or the Netherlands , though in England the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Authority , which issues licences for the use of embryos , has indicated that it would not issue any licence for research into `` reproductive cloning '' .<-->O
This is understood to be cloning to produce a fetus or live birth .<-->N
Research into cloning in the first 14 days of life might be possible in England .7 There have been several arguments given against human reproductive cloning : 1 .<-->O
It is liable to abuse .<-->O
It violates a person 's right to individuality , autonomy , selfhood , etc. .<-->O
It violates a person 's right to genetic individuality -LRB- whatever that is-identical twins can not have such a right -RRB- .<-->O
It allows eugenic selection .<-->F
It uses people as a means .<-->F
Clones are worse off in terms of wellbeing , especially psychological wellbeing .<-->O
There are safety concerns , especially an increased risk of serious genetic malformation , cancer or shortened lifespan .<-->O
There are , however , a number of arguments in favour of human reproductive cloning .<-->O
These include : 1 .<-->N
General liberty justifications .<-->N
Freedom to make personal reproductive choices .<-->F
Freedom of scientific enquiry .<-->F
Achieving a sense of immortality .<-->F
Eugenic selection -LRB- with or without gene therapy/enhancement -RRB- .<-->F
Social utility - cloning socially important people .<-->F

Replacement of a loved dead relative -LRB- with or without gene therapy/enhancement -RRB- .<-->F
`` Insurance '' - freeze a split embryo in case something happens to the first : as a source of tissue or as replacement for the first .<-->F

Cloning to prevent a genetic disease .<-->N
The arguments against cloning have been critically examined elsewhere and I will not repeat them here . '' ''<-->O
Few people have given arguments in favour of it .<-->N
Exceptions include arguments in favour of 7-12 ,12 with some commentators favouring only 10-1 1 13 14 or 1 1-12 . '<-->N
Justifications 10-12 -LRB- and possibly 7 -RRB- all regard cloning as a way of treating or avoiding disease .<-->O

Cloning as a source oftissuefor transplantation for cloning .<-->F
This paper examines 10 and to some extent 11 .<-->F
Human cloning as a source ofcells or tissue Cloning is the production of an identical or nearidentical genetic copy .<-->F
`` 6 Cloning can occur by fission or fusion .<-->F
Fission is the division ofa cell mass into two equal and identical parts , and the development of each into a separate but genetically identical or near-identical individual .<-->N
This occurs in nature as identical twins .<-->N
Cloning by fusion involves taking the nucleus from one cell and transferring it to an egg which has had its nucleus removed .<-->F
Placing the nucleus in the egg reprogrammes the DNA in the nucleus to replicate the whole individual from which the nucleus was derived : nuclear transfer .<-->F
It differs from fission in that the offspring has only one genetic parent , whose genome is nearly identical to that of the offspring .<-->N
In fission , the offspring , like the offspring of normal sexual reproduction , inherits half of its genetic material from each of two parents .<-->N
Henceforth , by `` cloning '' , I mean cloning by fusion .<-->N
Human cloning could be used in several ways to produce cells , tissues or organs for the treatment of human disease .<-->N
HUMAN CLONING AS A SOURCE OF MULTIPOTENT STEM CELLS In this paper I will differentiate between totipotent and multipotent stem cells .<-->N
Stem cells are cells which are early in developmental lineage and have the ability to differentiate into several different mature cell types .<-->N
Totipotent stem cells are very immature stem cells with the potential to develop into any ofthe mature cell types in the adult -LRB- liver , lung , skin , blood , etc -RRB- .<-->O
Multipotential stem cells are more mature stem cells with the potential to develop into different mature forms ofa particular cell lineage , for example , bone marrow stem cells can form either white or red blood cells , but they can not form liver cells .<-->O
Multipotential stem cells can be used as a. a vector for gene therapy .<-->N
b. cells for transplantation , especially in bone marrow .<-->N
Attempts have been made to use embryonic stem cells from other animals as vectors for gene therapy and as universal transplantation cells in humans .<-->N
Problems include limited differentiation and rejection .<-->N
Somatic cells are differentiated cells of the body , and not sex cells which give rise to sperm and eggs .<-->N
Cloning of somatic cells from a person who is intended as the recipient of cell therapy would provide a source of multipotential stem cells that are not rejected .<-->N
These could also be vectors for gene therapy .<-->N
A gene could be inserted into a somatic cell from the patient , followed by selection , nuclear transfer and the culture of the appropriate clonal population of cells in vitro .<-->O
These cells could then be returned to the patient as a source of new tissue -LRB- for example bone marrow in the case ofleukaemia -RRB- or as tissue without genetic abnormality -LRB- in the case of inherited genetic disease -RRB- .<-->O
The major experimental issues which would need to be addressed are developing clonal stability during cell amplification and ensuring differentiation into the cell type needed . '<-->O
3 It should be noted that this procedure does not necessarily involve the production of a multicellular embryo , nor its implantation in vivo or artificially .<-->N
-LRB- Indeed , cross-species cloningfusing human cells with cow eggs-produces embryos which will not develop into fetuses , let alone viable offspring .17 -RRB- A related procedure would produce totipotent stem cells which could differentiate into multipotent cells of a particular line or function , or even into a specific tissue .<-->O
This is much closer to reproductive cloning .<-->N
Embryonic stem cells from mice have been directed to differentiate into vascular endothelium , myocardial and skeletal tissue , haemopoietic precursors and neurons . '<-->F
8 However , it is not known whether the differentiation ofhuman totipotent stem cells can be controlled in vitro .<-->F
Unlike the previous application , the production of organs could involve reproductive cloning -LRB- the production ofa totipotent cell which forms a blastomere -RRB- , but then differentiates into a tissue after some days .<-->N
Initially , however , all early embryonic cells are identical .<-->N
Producing totipotent stem cells in this way is equivalent to the creation of an early embryo .<-->N
PRODUCTION OF EMBRYO/FETUS/CHILD / ADULT AS A SOURCE OF TISSUE An embryo , fetus , child or adult could be produced by cloning , and solid organs or differentiated tissue could be extracted from it .<-->O
Cloning as source of organs , tissue and cells for transplantation THE NEED FOR MORE ORGANS AND TISSUES Jeffrey Platts reports : `` So great is the demand that as few as 5 % of the organs needed in the United States ever become available '' . '<-->O
9 According to David K C Cooper , this is getting worse : `` The discrepancy between the number of potential recipients and donor organs is increasing by approximately 10-15 % annually '' .<-->O
`` 2 Increasing group.bmj.com on October 30 , 2015 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/Downloaded from Savulescu 89 procurement of cadaveric organs may not be the solution .<-->N
Anthony Dorling and colleagues write : `` A study from Seattle , USA , in 1992 identified an annual maximum ofonly 7,000 brain dead donors in the USA .<-->N
Assuming 100 % consent and suitability , these 14,000 potential kidney grafts would still not match the numbers ofnew patients commencing dialysis each year .<-->O
The clear implication is that an alternative source of organs is needed .<-->N
`` 2 ' Not only is there a shortage of tissue or organs for those with organ failure , but there remain serious problems with the compatibility oftissue or organs used , requiring immunosuppressive therapy with serious side effects .<-->O
Using cloned tissue would have enormous theoretical advantages , as it could be abundant and there is near perfect immunocompatibility .22 There are several ways human cloning could be used to address the shortfall oforgans and tissues , and each raises different ethical concerns .<-->O
PRODUCTION OF TISSUE OR CELLS ONLY BY CONTROLLING DIFFERENTIATION I will now give an argument to support the use of cloning to produce cells or tissues through control of cellular differentiation .<-->O
Thefate ofone 's own tissue Individuals have a strong interest or right in determining the fate of their own body parts , including their own cells and tissues , at least when this affects the length and quality oftheir own life .<-->O
A right might be defended in terms of autonomy or property rights in body parts .<-->O
This right extends -LRB- under some circumstances -RRB- both to the proliferation of cells and to their transmutation into other cell types -LRB- which I will call the Principle ofTissue Transmutation -RRB- .<-->O
Defending the Principle of Tissue Transmutation Consider the following hypothetical example : Lucas I Lucas is a 22-year-old man with leukaemia .<-->N
The only effective treatment will be a bone marrow transplant .<-->N
There is no compatible donor .<-->N
However , there is a drug which selects a healthy bone marrow cell and causes it to multiply .<-->N
A doctor would be negligent if he or she did not employ such a drug for the treatment of Lucas 's leukaemia .<-->O
Indeed , there is a moral imperative to develop such drugs if we can and use them .<-->O
Colony-stimulating factors , which cause blood cells to multiply , are already used in the treatment of leukaemia , and with stored marrow from those in remission in leukaemia before use for reconstitution during relapse .<-->N
Lucas II In this version of the example , the drug causes Lucas 's healthy skin cells to turn into healthy bone marrow stem cells .<-->N
There is no relevant moral difference between Lucas I and II .<-->O
We should develop such drugs and doctors would be negligent if they did not use them .<-->O
If this is right , there is nothing problematic about cloning to produce cells or tissues for transplantation by controlling differentiation .<-->O
All we would be doing is taking , say , a skin cell and turning on and off some components of the total genetic complement to cause the cell to divide as a bone marrow cell .<-->O
We are causing a differentiated cell -LRB- skin cell -RRB- to turn directly into a multipotent stem cell -LRB- bone marrow stem cell -RRB- .<-->N
Are there any objections ?<-->N
The major objection is one ofpracticality .<-->N
It is going to be very difficult to cause a skin cell to turn directly into a bone marrow cell .<-->N
There are also safety considerations .<-->N
Because we are taking a cell which has already undergone many cell divisions during terminal differentiation to give a mature cell such as a skin cell , and accumulated mutations , there is a theoretical concern about an increased likelihood ofmalignancy in that clonal population .<-->O
However , the donor cell in these cases is the same age as the recipient -LRB- exactly -RRB- , and a shorter life span would not be expected .<-->N
There may also be an advantage in some diseases , such as leukemia , to having a degree of incompatibility between donor and recipient bone marrow so as to enable the donor cells to recognise and destroy malignant recipient cells .<-->O
This would not apply to non-malignant diseases in which bone marrow transplant is employed , such as the leukodystrophies .<-->N
Most importantly , all these concerns need to be addressed by further research .<-->O
Lucas IIA In practice , it is most likely that skin cells will not be able to be turned directly into bone marrow cells : there will need to be a stage of totipotency in between .<-->O
The most likely way of producing cells to treat Lucas II is via the cloning route , where a skin cell nucleus is passed through an oocyte to give a totipotent cell .<-->O
The production of a totipotent stem cell is the production of an embryo .<-->N
Production ofan embryo as a source ofcells or tissues There are two ways in which an embryo could be a source of cells and tissues .<-->N
Firstly , the early embryonic cells could be made to differentiate into cells of one tissue type , for example , bone group.bmj.com on October 30 , 2015 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/Downloaded from 90 Should we clone human beings ?<-->N
Cloning as a source oftissuefor transplantation marrow .<-->N
Secondly , differentiated cells or tissues from an older embryo could be extracted and used directly .<-->N
Are these permissible ?<-->N
In England , the Royal Society ' 5 has given limited support to cloning for the purposes of treating human disease .<-->O
The Human Genetics Advisory Commission -LRB- HGAC -RRB- defines this as `` therapeutic cloning , '' differentiating it from `` reproductive cloning '' ,7 Both bodies claim that embryo experimentation in the first 14 days is permitted by English law , and question whether cloning in this period would raise any new ethical issues .<-->O
Cloning in this circumstance raises few ethical issues .<-->N
What is produced , at least in the first few days of division after a totipotent cell has been produced from an adult skin cell , is just a skin cell from that person with an altered gene expression profile -LRB- some genes turned on and some turned off -RRB- .<-->O
In one way , it is just an existing skin cell behaving differently from normal skin cells , perhaps more like a malignant skin cell .<-->O
The significant processes are ones of cellular multiplication and later , cellular differentiation .<-->N
If this is true , why stop at research at 14 days ?<-->N
Consider the third version of the Lucas case : Lucas III The same as Lucas IIA , but in this case , Lucas also needs a kidney transplant .<-->N
Therefore , in addition to the skin cell developing blood stem cells -LRB- via the embryo -RRB- , the process is adjusted so that a kidney is produced .<-->N
The production of another tissue type or organ does not raise any new relevant ethical consideration .<-->O
Indeed , if Lucas did not need the kidney , it could be used for someone else who required a kidney -LRB- if , of course , in vitro maturation techniques had been developed to the extent that a functioning organ of sufficient size could be produced -RRB- .<-->O
Consider now : Lucas IV In addition to the blood cells , all the tissue of a normal human embryo is produced , organised in the anatomical arrangement of an embryo .<-->N
This -LRB- in principle -RRB- might or might not involve development in a womb .<-->O
For simplicity , let us assume that this occurs in vitro -LRB- though this is impossible at present -RRB- .<-->O
Is there any morally relevant difference from the previous versions ?<-->N
It is not relevant that many different tissues are produced rather than one .<-->O
Nor is the size ofthese tissues or their arrangement morally relevant .<-->N
Ifthere is a difference , it must be that a special kind oftissue has been produced , or that some special relationship develops between existing tissues , and that a morally significant entity then exists .<-->O
When does this special point in embryonic development occur ?<-->N
The most plausible point is some point during the development of the brain .<-->O
There are two main candidates : 1 .<-->N
when tissue differentiates and the first identifiable brain structures come into existence as the neural plate around day 19.23 2 .<-->N
when the brain supports some morally significant function : consciousness or selfconsciousness or rational self-consciousness .<-->O
The earliest of these , consciousness , does not occur until well into fetal development .<-->N
On the first view , utilisation of cloning techniques in the first two weeks to study cellular differentiation is justifiable .<-->O
The most defensible view , I believe , is that our continued existence only becomes morally relevant when we become selfconscious .<-->O
-LRB- Of course , if a fetus can feel pain at some earlier point , but is not self-conscious , its existence is morally relevant in a different way : we ought not to inflict unnecessary pain on it , though it may be permissible to end its life painlessly . -RRB-<-->O
On this view , we should use the drug to cause Lucas IV 's skin cells to transmutate and remove bone marrow from these .<-->N
What is going on in Lucas IV is no different , morally speaking , from cloning .<-->N
Ifthis is right , it is justifiable to extract differentiated tissues from young fetuses which have been cloned .<-->O
Conception and potentiality The other usual point in development which is taken to be morally significant is conception .24 However , in the case of cloning , there is no conception .<-->N
There is just a process of turning some switches in an already existing cell .<-->N
Proponents of the persons-begin-to-exist-at-conception view might reply that cloning is like conception .<-->O
An individual begins to exist at the point of nuclear transfer .<-->N
But why should we accept this ?<-->N
Conception seems quite different .<-->N
Conception involves the unification of two different entities , the sperm and the egg , to form a new entity , the totipotent stem cell .<-->N
In the case ofcloning , there is identity between the cell before and after nuclear transfer-it is the same cell .<-->N
Something new and important does happen to the entity when it undergoes nuclear transfer , just as something new and important happens when a cell with a malignant potential becomes malignant .<-->O
But it is the same cell .<-->N
group.bmj.com on October 30 , 2015 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/Downloaded from Savulescu 91 POTENTIALITY In response , one might claim that after nuclear transfer the cell undergoes a radically and morally significant change : it acquires the potential to be a person .<-->O
On this view , the cell immediately prior to nuclear transfer does not have the potential to be a human being but after nuclear transfer , it has the potential to be a human being .<-->O
This has a jarring ring to it .<-->N
What happens when a skin cell turns into a totipotent stem cell is that a few of its genetic switches are turned on and others turned off .<-->N
To say it does n't have the potential to be a human being until its nucleus is placed in the egg cytoplasm is like saying my car does not have the potential to get me from Melbourne to Sydney unless the key is turned in the ignition .<-->O
-LRB- Rather , we should say that it has the potential but that that potential may not be realised ifthe key is not turned in the ignition . -RRB-<-->O
Or it is like saying that a stick of dynamite acquires the potential to cause an explosion when placed in the vicinity of a lighted match .<-->N
Of course , a stick of dynamite has the potential to cause an explosion , and various conditions , including placing it in the vicinity of a lighted match , are sufficient to realise this potential .<-->O
In general terms , X has the potential to be Y , if X would be a Y if conditions c , d , e , ... obtained .<-->N
Nuclear transfer is like a number of other conditions -LRB- such as adequate placental blood flow -RRB- which must obtain if a skin cell is to become a person .<-->O
There may be another difference between a mature skin cell and a fertilised egg .<-->N
Totipotent cells directly give rise to human beings but mature skin cells do not .<-->N
The latter must go through a further stage of totipotency first .<-->N
And it may be that that change is significant enough to say that the skin cell does not itselfhave the potential to create a human being .<-->O
However , something with the potential to cause A may not lead directly to A. Killing the president may not lead directly to a world war .<-->N
However , it may lead to political destabilisation which will cause a world war .<-->O
Killing the president does then have the potential to cause a world war .<-->N
At bottom , these issues may be semantic , and depend on how we choose to define `` potential . ''<-->N
What matters morally is whether skin cells can become human beings with the application of technology , and whether they should .<-->N
That is an important moral feature of nuclear transfer .<-->N
Nuclear transfer is a technical intervention which it is necessary to employ if a skin cell is to become a person , just as microsurgical transfer of an embryo formed in vitro is necessary ifthe embryo is to become a person .<-->O
I can not see any intrinsic morally significant difference between a mature skin cell , the totipotent stem cell derived from it , and a fertilised egg .<-->O
They are all cells which could give rise to a person if certain conditions obtained .<-->N
-LRB- Thus , to claim that experimentation on cloned embryos is acceptable , but the same experimentation on non-cloned embryos is not acceptable , because the former are not embryos but totipotent stem cells , is sophistry . -RRB-<-->O
Looking at cloning this way exposes new difficulties for those who appeal to the potential of embryos to become persons and the moral significance of conception as a basis for opposition to abortion .<-->O
If all our cells could be persons , then we can not appeal to the fact that an embryo could be a person to justify the special treatment we give it .<-->O
Cloning forces us to abandon the old arguments supporting special treatment offertilised eggs .<-->O
PRODUCTION OF A FETUS If one believes that the morally significant event in development is something related to consciousness , then extracting tissue or organs from a cloned fetus up until that point at which the morally relevant event occurs is acceptable .<-->O
Indeed , in law , a legal persona does not come into existence until birth .<-->N
At least in Australia and England , abortion is permissible throughout fetal development .<-->N
PRODUCTION OF A CHILD OR ADULT AS A SOURCE OF CELLS OR TISSUES Like the production of a self-conscious fetus , the production ofa cloned child or adult is liable to all the usual cloning objections , together with the severe limitations on the ways in which tissue can be taken from donors for transplantation .<-->O
Many writers support cloning for the purposes of studying cellular differentiation because they argue that cloning does not raise serious new issues above those raised by embryo experimentation . '<-->O
5 Such support for cloning is too limited .<-->O
On one view , there is no relevant difference between early embryo research and later embryo/early fetal research .<-->O
Indeed , the latter stand more chance of providing viable tissue for transplantation , at least in the near future .<-->O
While producing a cloned live child as a source of tissue for transplantation would raise new and important issues , producing embryos and early fetuses as a source oftissue for transplantation may be morally obligatory .<-->O
Consistency Is this a significant deviation from existing practice ?<-->N
FETAL TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION In fact , fetal tissue has been widely used in medicine .<-->N
Human fetal thymus transplantation is standard therapy for thymic aplasia or Di George 's group.bmj.com on October 30 , 2015 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/Downloaded from 92 Should we clone human beings ?<-->N
Cloning as a source oftissuefor transplantation syndrome .<-->F
It has also been used in conjunction with fetal liver for the treatment of subacute combined immunodeficiency .<-->N
Human fetal liver and umbilical cord blood have been used as a source ofhaematopoietic cells in the treatment of acute leukaemia and aplastic anaemia .<-->F
Liver has also been used for radiation accidents and storage disorders .<-->N
The main problem has been immune rejection .25 One woman with aplastic anaemia received fetal liver from her own 22-week fetus subsequent to elective abortion over 20 years ago .26 Fetal brain tissue from aborted fetuses has been used as source of tissue for the treatment of Parkinson 's disease .<-->O
Neural grafts show long term survival and function in patients with Parkinson 's disease , though significant problems remain .2728 Fetal tissue holds promise as treatment for Huntington 's disease ,29 30 spinal cord injuries ,3 ' demyelinating disorders ,27 retinal degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa ,3233 hippocampal lesions associated with temporal lobe epilepsy , cerebral ischaemia , stroke and head injury ,34 and beta thalassemia in utero using fetal liver .35 Fetal pancreas has also been used in the treatment of diabetes .<-->O
Fetal tissue banks Indeed , in the US and England , fetal tissue banks exist to distribute fetal tissues from abortion clinics for the purposes ofmedical research and treatment .<-->N
In the US , the Central Laboratory for Human Embryology in Washington , the National Diseases Research Interchange , and the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine and the National Abortion Federation , all distribute fetal tissue .<-->F
In the UK , the Medical Research Council 's fetal tissue bank was established in 1957 and disperses about 5,000 tissues a year .<-->F
CONCEPTION OF A NON-CLONED CHILD AS A SOURCE OF BONE MARROW : AYALA CASE Not only has fetal tissue been used for the treatment of human disease , but human individuals have been deliberately conceived as a source of tissue for transplantation .<-->F
In the widely discussed Ayala case , a 17-year-old girl , Anissa , had leukaemia .<-->F
No donor had been found in two years .<-->F
Her father had his vasectomy reversed with the intention of having another child to serve as a bone marrow donor .<-->N
There was a one in four chance the child would be compatible with Anissa .<-->N
The child , Marissa , was born and was a compatible donor and a successful transplant was performed .36 A report four years later noted : `` Marissa is now a healthy four-year-old , and , by all accounts , as loved and cherished a child as her parents said she would be .<-->O
The marrow transplant was a success , and Anissa is now a married , leukaemia-free , bank clerk .<-->N
`` 37 Assisted reproduction -LRB- IVF -RRB- has been used to produce children to serve as bone marrow donors .38 It is worth noting that had cloning been available , there would have been a 100 % chance of perfect tissue compatibility and a live child need not have been produced .<-->O
Objections While there are some precedents for the proposal to use cloning to produce tissue for transplantation , what is distinctive about this proposal is that human tissue will be : -LRB- i -RRB- cloned and -LRB- ii -RRB- deliberately created with abortion in mind .<-->O
This raises new objections .<-->N
ABORTION IS WRONG Burtchaell , a Catholic theologian , in considering the ethics of fetal tissue research , claims that abortion is morally wrong and that fetal tissue can not be used for research because no one can give informed consent for its use and to use it would be complicity in wrongful killing .39 He claims that mothers can not consent : `` The flaw in this claim -LSB- that mothers can consent -RSB- is that the tissue is from within her body but is the body of another , with distinct genotype , blood , gender , etc. '' Claims such as those of Burtchaell are more problematic in the case of cloning .<-->O
If the embryo were cloned from the mother , it would be of the same genotype as her , and , arguably , one of her tissues .<-->N
Now at some point a cloned tissue is no longer just a tissue from its clone : it exists as an individual in its own right and at some point has interests as other individuals do .<-->O
But the latter point occurs , I believe , when the cloned individual becomes self-conscious .<-->N
The presence or absence of a distinct genotype is irrelevant .<-->O
We are not justified in treating an identical twin differently from a non-identical twin because the latter has a distinct genotype .<-->N
In a society that permits abortion on demand , sometimes for little or no reason , it is hard to see how women can justifiably be prevented from aborting a fetus for the purpose of saving someone 's life .<-->O
And surely it is more respectful of the fetus , ifthe fetus is an object ofrespect , that its body parts be used for good rather than for no good purpose at all .<-->O
IT IS WORSE TO BE A CLONE Some have argued that it is worse to be a plone .4 ` This may be plausible in the sense that a person suffers in virtue of being a clone - living in the shadow of its `` parent '' , feeling less like an group.bmj.com on October 30 , 2015 - Published by http://jme.bmj.com/Downloaded from Savulescu 93 individual , treated as a means and not an end , etc. .<-->O
Thus cloning in the Ayala case would raise some new -LRB- but I do not believe overwhelming -RRB- issues which need consideration .<-->O
But cloning followed by abortion does not .<-->N
I ca n't make any sense ofthe claim that it is worse to be a cloned cell or tissue .<-->O
These are not the things we ascribe these kinds of interests to .<-->N
Cloning is bad when it is bad for a person .<-->O
Likewise , arguments regarding `` instrumentalisation '' apply to persons , and not to tissues and cells .<-->N
CREATING LIFE WITH THE INTENTION OF ENDING IT TO PROVIDE TISSUE Using cloning to produce embryos or fetuses as a source of tissue would involve deliberately creating life for the purposes ofdestroying it .<-->N
It involves intentionally killing the fetus .<-->N
This differs from abortion where women do not intend to become pregnant for the purpose ofhaving an abortion .<-->N
Is it wrong deliberately to conceive a fetus for the sake of providing tissue ?<-->N
Most of the guidelines on the use of fetal tissue aim to stop women having children just to provide tissues .4 ' The reason behind this is some background belief that abortion is itselfwrong .<-->O
These guidelines aim to avoid moral taint objections that we can not benefit from wrong-doing .<-->O
More importantly , there is a concern that promoting some good outcome from abortion would encourage abortion .<-->O
However , in this case , abortion would not be encouraged because this is abortion in a very special context : it is abortion of a cloned fetus for medical purposes .<-->O
But is it wrong deliberately to use abortion to bring about some good outcome ?<-->N
In some countries -LRB- for example those in the former Eastern bloc -RRB- , abortion is or was the main available form ofbirth control .<-->N
A woman who had intercourse knowing that she might fall pregnant , in which case she would have an abortion , would not necessarily be acting wrongly in such a country , if the alternative was celibacy .<-->O
When the only way to achieve some worthwhile end - sexual expression - is through abortion , it seems justifiable .<-->O
The question is : is the use of cloned fetal tissue the best way of increasing the pool of transplantable tissues and organs ?<-->N
42 AN OBJECTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF TISSUE TRANSMUTATION Another objection to the proposal is that we do not have the right to determine the fate of all our cells .<-->O
For example , we are limited in what we can do with our sex cells .<-->N
However , we should only be constrained in using our own cells when that use puts others at risk .<-->N
This is not so in transmutation until another individual with moral interests comes into existence .<-->O
SURROGACY CONCERNS At least at present , later embryonic and fetal development can only occur inside a woman 's uterus , so some of the proposals here would require a surrogate .<-->O
I have assumed that any surrogate would be freely consenting .<-->N
Concerns with surrogacy have been addressed elsewhere ,43 though cloning for this purpose would raise some different concerns .<-->O
There would be no surrogacy concerns if the donor cell were derived from the mother -LRB- she would be carrying one of her own cells -RRB- , from the mother 's child -LRB- she would be carrying her child again -RRB- or if an artificial womb were ever developed .<-->O
SHOULD WE GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO SOMATIC CELLS ?<-->N
I have claimed that the totipotent cells ofthe early embryo , and indeed the embryo , do not have greater moral significance than adult skin cells -LRB- or indeed lung or colon or any nucleated cells -RRB- .<-->O
I have used this observation to downgrade the importance we attach to embryonic cells .<-->N
However , it might be argued that we should upgrade the importance which we attach to somatic cells .<-->O
This is a reductio ad absurdum of the position which gives importance to the embryo , and indeed which gives weight to anatomical structure rather than function .<-->O
Ifwe should show special respect to all cells , surgeons should be attempting to excise the very minimum tissue -LRB- down to the last cell -RRB- necessary during operations .<-->O
We should be doing research into preventing the neuronal loss which occurs normally during childhood .<-->N
The desquamation of a skin cell should be as monumental , according to those who believe that abortion is killing persons , as the loss of a whole person .<-->O
These claims are , I think , all absurd .<-->O
YUK FACTOR Many people would find it shocking for a fetus to be created and then destroyed as a source of organs .<-->N
But many people found artificial insemination abhorrent , IVF shocking and the use of animal organs revolting .<-->O
Watching an abortion is horrible .<-->N
However , the fact that people find something repulsive does not settle whether it is wrong .<-->O
The achievement in applied ethics , if there is one , of the last 50 years has been to get people to rise above their gut feelings and examine the reasons for a practice .<-->O

Cloning as a source oftissuefor transplantation PERMISSIVE AND OBSTRUCTIVE ETHICS Many people believe that ethicists should be merely moral watch-dogs , barking when they see something going wrong .<-->O
However , ethics may also be permissive .<-->N
Thus ethics may require that we stop interfering , as was the case in the treatment of homosexuals .<-->N
Ethics should not only be obstructive but constructive .<-->N
To delay unnecessarily a good piece of research which will result in a life-saving drug is to be responsible for some people 's deaths .<-->O
It is to act wrongly .<-->N
This debate about cloning illustrates a possible permissive and constructive role for ethics .<-->O
Conclusion The most justified use ofhuman cloning is arguably to produce stem cells for the treatment ofdisease .<-->N
I have argued that it is not only reasonable to produce embryos as a source of multipotent stem cells , but that it is morally required to produce embryos and early fetuses as a source of tissue for transplantation .<-->N
This argument hinges on : 1 .<-->N
The claim that the moral status of the cloned embryo and early fetus is no different from that ofthe somatic cell from which they are derived .<-->N
The claim that there is no morally relevant difference between the fetus and the embryo until some critical point in brain development and function .<-->O
The fact that the practice is consistent with existing practices of fetal tissue transplantation and conceiving humans as a source oftissue for transplantation -LRB- the Ayala case -RRB- .<-->N
An argument from beneficence .<-->N
This practice would achieve much good .<-->O
An argument from autonomy .<-->N
This was the principle of tissue transmutation : that we should be able to determine the fate ofour own cells , including whether they change into other cell types .<-->O
This proposal avoids all the usual objections to cloning .<-->N
The major concerns are practicality and safety .<-->N
This requires further study .<-->N
The HGAC and The Royal Society have broached the possibility ofproducing clones for up to 14 days : `` therapeutic cloning '' .<-->N
Those bodies believe that it is acceptable to produce and destroy an embryo but not a fetus .<-->O
Women abort fetuses up to 20 weeks and later .<-->N
We could make it mandatory that women have abortions earlier -LRB- with rapid pregnancy testing -RRB- .<-->N
However , we do not .<-->N
Moreover , while the decision for most women to have an abortion is a momentous and considered one , in practice , we allow women to abort fetuses regardless of their reasons , indeed occasionally for no or bad reasons .<-->O
If a woman could abort a fetus because she wanted a child with a certain horoscope sign , surely a woman should be able to abort a fetus to save a person 's life .<-->O
I have been discussing cloning for the purposes of saving people 's lives or drastically improving their quality .<-->N
While we beat our breasts about human dignity and the rights of cells of different sorts , people are dying of leukaemia and kidney disease .<-->O
If a woman wants to carry a clone of her or someone else 's child to save a life , it may not be society 's place to interfere .<-->N
The recent development of human totipotent stem cell lines from embryonic tissue4445 means that we are closer to understanding cellular development and differentiation , generating the hope that we may be able to produce tissue for transplantation directly from totipotent stem cells without going to the stage of producing a mature embryo or fetus .<-->O
But that is still some way off , and at present requires deriving the cell lines from embryonic tissue .<-->N
The use of nuclear transfer may still be the best way to produce highly compatible tissue , even coupled with this technology .<-->O
We could address the shortage of tissue for transplantation now .<-->N
We could routinely employ embryo-splitting during IVF and create embryo banks as a source of fetal tissue .<-->N
Indeed , rather than destroying millions of spare embryos , we could use them as a source of human tissue .<-->O
As opposed to using nuclear transfer as a source of tissue , such proposals could not be instituted with the consent of a person who both needs the tissue and is the source of the tissue .<-->O
That is , we could not appeal to the Principle of Tissue Transmutation to justify these proposals , though they may be justifiable on other grounds .<-->O
A couple that had been married for only two years was in a terrible car accident .<-->N
The wife walked away with a few cuts and bruises .<-->N
The husband , however was unconscious when the paramedics arrived .<-->F
He went into a coma shortly after arriving at the nearby hospital .<-->F
He came out of the coma but was never to be the same again .<-->N
It turns out that when he was in the accident he had severe head trauma , and would be a vegetable the rest of his life .<-->O
He could not take part in the reproduction of children .<-->N
The wife is now distraught because they will never have children together .<-->O
She heard about the possibility of cloning and believes that it is the only way that she will ever have children .<-->N
Is it so ?<-->N
Introduction The ethics of human cloning has become a great issue in the past few years .<-->N
The advocates for both sides of the issue have many reasons to clone or not to clone .<-->N
This is an attempt to explore the pros and cons of human cloning and to provide enough information of both sides of the arguments in order for the reader to make their own informed decision on whether human cloning is ethical or not .<-->O
Cloning will first be defined .<-->N
Then a brief explanation of why questions concerning cloning humans have arisen will be presented .<-->N
Some things can not be known for sure unless it is tested , i.e. , human cloning is allowed .<-->N
Followed by that , a discussion of the facts and opinions that support cloning will be presented and then the same against cloning .<-->O
Please remember that not all of this has proven true nor is able to be proven yet , but has simply been argued as a scientific hypothesis .<-->O
Finally , my own personal opinion will be stated .<-->O
Defining Human Cloning When speaking of human cloning , what is meant ?<-->N
Different groups and organizations define it differently .<-->F
To use a specific definition , the American Medical Association -LRB- AMA -RRB- defined cloning as the production of genetically identical organisms via somatic cell nuclear transfer .<-->F
Somatic cell nuclear transfer refers to the process which the nucleus of a somatic cell of an existing organism is transferred into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed -LRB- Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 1 -RRB- .<-->N
In other words , cloning is the method of produce a baby that has the same genes as its parent .<-->N
You take an egg and remove its nucleus , which contains the DNA/genes .<-->N
Then you take the DNA from an adult cell and insert it into the egg , either by fusing the adult cell with the enucleated egg , or by a sophisticated nuclear transfer .<-->N
You then stimulate the reconstructed egg electrically or chemically and try to make it start to divide and become an embryo .<-->O
You then use the same process to implant the egg into a surrogate mother that you would use with artificial insemination .<-->N
-LRB- Eibert -RRB- However , many groups have used a broader definition of cloning .<-->N
They include the production of tissues and organs through growing cells or tissues in cultures along with the actual producing of embryos to be born .<-->N
This is done with the use of stem cells .<-->N
When an egg is fertilized and begins to divide , the cells are all alike .<-->N
As the cells divide , certain cells differentiate and become the stem cells that produce certain tissue and then organs .<-->O
Research in this very active .<-->N
There is still much for scientists to learn about cell differentiation and how it works .<-->O
To a clone an organ , a stem cell must be produced and then used to a clone that specific organ .<-->N
For the sake of this paper , both definitions will be used in order to cover all opinions .<-->O
One must understand that cloning does not produce an exact copy of the person being cloned .<-->O
What cloning does , is that it copies the DNA/genes of the person and creates a duplicate genetically .<-->N
The person will not be a Xerox copy .<-->N
He or she will grow up in a different environment than the clone , with different experiences and different opportunities .<-->N
Genetics does not wholly define a person and the personality .<-->N
How It All Started In February 1997 , when embryologist Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at Roslin Institute in Scotland were able to clone a lamb , named Dolly , the world was introduced to a new possibility and will never be the same again -LRB- Nash -RRB- .<-->O
Before this , cloning was thought to be impossible , but now there is living proof that the technology and knowledge to clone animals exist .<-->O
Questions began to arise within governments and scientific organizations and they began to respond .<-->N
Are humans next ?<-->F
Is it possible to use this procedure to clone humans also ?<-->N
Would anyone actually try ?<-->N
What can we learn if we clone humans ?<-->N
How will this affect the world ?<-->N
These are only a few of the questions that have surfaced and need answered .<-->N
A whole new concept in ethics was created when the birth of Dolly was announced .<-->N
There are a great number of possible medical benefits and disadvantages to cloning and its technology .<-->O
They include the following : Potential Medical Benefits The possibility that through cloning technology we will learn to renew activity of damaged cells by growing new cells and replacing them .<-->O
The capability to create humans with identical genetic makeup to act as organ donors for each other , i.e. , kidney and bone marrow transplants .<-->N
The benefit of studying cell differentiation at the same time that cloning is studied and developed .<-->N
Sterile couples will be able to have offspring will have either the mother s or father s genetic pattern .<-->O
Potential Harms and Disadvantages The possibility of compromising individualities .<-->N
Loss of genetic variation .<-->N
A black market of fetuses may arise from desirable donors that will want to be able to clone themselves , i.e. , movie stars , athletes , and others .<-->O
Technology is not well developed .<-->N
It has a low fertility rate .<-->N
In cloning Dolly , 277 eggs were used , 30 started to divide , nine induced pregnancy , and only one survived to term -LRB- Nash -RRB- .<-->N
Clones may be treated as second-class citizens .<-->N
Unknown psychosocial harms with impacts on the family and society .<-->N
The Governments Make a Move The governments went to work shortly after the cloning of Dolly .<-->N
They wanted to take control and make laws before anything drastic could ever happen .<-->N
Several ethics committees were asked to decide whether scientists should be allowed to try to clone humans .<-->O
Many of the committees found the data displayed above .<-->N
In the United States , the National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended a five-year moratorium on cloning a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer -LRB- Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 1 -RRB- .<-->N
In the state of Michigan , Governor Engler signed a law last year making human cloning illegal with harsh penalties if it is attempted -LRB- Governor Engler ... -RRB- .<-->N
In the United Kingdom , the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority -LRB- HFEA -RRB- and the Human Genetics Advisory Commission -LRB- HGEC -RRB- have approved human cloning for therapeutic purposes , but not to clone children -LRB- HFEA supports Human Cloning in U.K. -RRB- .<-->N
Many organizations have come out and stated their opinions also .<-->N
Amongst all this ethical defining , many people are being ignored by the governments .<-->N
People are speaking out about what they want done .<-->N
Let Us Clone After a couple has had their first child , to their disappointment they become infertile and can not have more children .<-->N
Cloning would enable such a couple to have a second child , perhaps a younger twin to the child they already have .<-->O
This example has a very good argument .<-->O
Many couples have difficulties having children , and sometimes it is impossible for couples to have children because they are infertile .<-->N
Cloning would allow these couples to have children .<-->N
Also , occasionally a woman is born without a uterus or has other complications and can not produce eggs , then with the help of a surrogate mother , she can have a child of her own using her own DNA or her husband s .<-->N
This and the example at the beginning are both arguments that some have made in promoting cloning .<-->N
It is hard to tell someone that they can not use cloning to have children when no other possible ways to produce offspring are available .<-->N
This is one reason why it is difficult to decide if cloning is ethical or not .<-->O
The following are some of the reasons why cloning should be allowed .<-->N
As just discussed , cloning can be used to help benefit those that are sterile and can not have children through the normal , natural way .<-->O
It is the desire of most couples to have children and when it is impossible to bare children of your own , some are willing to do anything to have a child .<-->O
Cloning will allow them to have a child or many children that have the genetic pattern of one of the parents .<-->N
Through cloning , research can progress .<-->N
It is hard to say what we can learn from cloning if cloning is not allowed .<-->N
We possibly can learn more about cell differentiation .<-->N
We can learn enough to produce human organs without having to produce human beings .<-->N
We may develop technology to allow easier genetic testing and fixing problems such as spinal cord injuries , cancer , Tay-Sachs disease , and many more .<-->O
Cloning organs for organ transplants is one of the major practical reasons that cloning should be allowed .<-->O
There is always a high demand for organs .<-->O
Some argue for the cloning of humans to create spare body parts .<-->N
Others talk of just wanting to clone an organ to replace a defective organ .<-->O
Rejuvenation is also a key argument for advocates of cloning .<-->N
Human cloning may one day reverse heart attacks .<-->N
Some scientists believe that by injecting cloned healthy heart cells into damaged heart tissue will lead to healing of the heart -LRB- Human Cloning Foundation -RRB- .<-->O
By combining the technology for cloning and the technology for growing human stem cells , conditions like Alzheimer = s disease , Parkinson = s disease , and degenerative joint disease may be curable .<-->O
The possibilities are endless and may be left undiscovered if human cloning is banned .<-->N
Thou Shalt Not Clone One of the main goals of the government is to protect human life .<-->N
Some people want the government to regulate cloning and not allow it .<-->N
Michigan = s government believes this and became the first government to place a ban on cloning .<-->N
As mentioned before , the governor signed laws that prohibit engaging or attempting to engage in human cloning .<-->O
A Michigan state senator , Mr. Bennett said , This legislation boils down to one thing : Prohibiting the creation of human life for scientific research .<-->N
Human cloning is wrong ; it will be five years from now ; and wrong 100 years from now !<-->O
-LRB- Governor Engler ... -RRB- Producing clones for research or to use their parts is unethical .<-->N
It would be against the code of ethics of a doctor to harm a clone -LRB- i.e. , use it for an organ transplant -RRB- .<-->O
The clone would be a human being and deserve all the rights and privileges that a non-cloned human has .<-->O
A clone should not be a second-class citizen .<-->N
It is speculated that they would be considered as such .<-->N
The American Medical Association holds four points of reason why cloning should not take place .<-->N
They are : 1 -RRB- there are unknown physical harms introduced by cloning , 2 -RRB- unknown psychosocial harms introduced by cloning , including violations of autonomy and privacy , 3 -RRB- impacts on familial and societal relations , and 4 -RRB- potential effects on the human gene pool -LRB- Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 4-6 -RRB- .<-->O
We just simply do not know the harms that will come from cloning .<-->O
Cloning would lead to the loss of individuality because one = s genetic predispositions and conditions would be known .<-->O
If raised by a clone-parent or as a sibling to the cloned , one may have great expectations to live up to .<-->N
However , the human clones could differ greatly in personality and even grow up with different conditions than the cloned .<-->O
Even monozygotic twins differ .<-->N
This could be a great stress to the clone and possibly even the loss of ability to chose for itself -LRB- Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 5 -RRB- .<-->O
The long term genetic effects of cloning may cause more problems than can be imagined .<-->N
The question of what can go wrong in cloning needs to be discussed .<-->N
In an evolutionary standpoint , cloning is not good .<-->N
Evolution relies on a continual mixing and matching of genes to keep the gene pool alive -LRB- McCormack -RRB- .<-->N
With cloning , the natural process of selection of genes would be bypassed and evolution would be impaired .<-->O
The Council of Ethical and Judicial Affairs for the AMA stated the following concerning possible problems with mutations and clones : Since the somatic cell from which clones originate likely will have acquired mutations , serial cloning would compound the accumulation that occurs in somatic cells .<-->O
Although these mutations might not be apparent at the time of cloning , genetics problems could become exacerbated in future generations .<-->O
-LRB- Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 6 -RRB- We can see that cloning can possibly change the gene pool from how we now know it .<-->N
Most likely , it would not be a good change .<-->O
Technology as we presently know it will not effectively support the cloning of humans .<-->O
As mentioned before , the success rate was quite low when cloning Dolly .<-->O
Only one of the 277 tries succeeded , see chart 1 .<-->N
The same problems of the difficulty of having the fertilized egg implant parallels with that in in vitro fertilization .<-->N
Technology has not yet been able to provide an answer to this problem .<-->N
The fear that clones will be treated as second-class citizens is also present .<-->O
If a clone is created to act as bone marrow or kidney donor , the question arises if they would be treated like the first child ?<-->N
Would the parents even love this child the same ?<-->N
If not , this would lead to negative self-esteem and/or other physiological problems .<-->O
There is also the fear that some would want to clone people to create large armies of the same soldier or even produce large amounts of workers .<-->O
This would also lead to the creation of a second and lower class for clones .<-->N
From a Latter-day Saint point of view , the Proclamation on the Family clearly does not agree with cloning .<-->O
The Proclamation states : We ... declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman , lawfully wedded as husband and wife .<-->N
We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed .<-->N
We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God s plan .<-->O
-LRB- Italics added -RRB- In other words , the power to create humans is only to be used in a marriage between husband and wife .<-->N
Cloning only involves one parent , therefore it is not following God s plan in which a man s sperm and a woman s egg are needed to create life .<-->N
My Personal Recommendation As a student studying biology , I have tried to approach both sides and approach them with an unbiased opinion .<-->N
I personally think that the world of genetics is fascinating , but after learning of what is now possible through technology , I changed my mind about pursuing a career in the field .<-->O
I see cloning as a wonderful advancement in technology and knowledge .<-->O
I do not think it should be used to reproduce humans though .<-->O
I do not believe that we should try to develop other ways beside the natural way to bring life into this world .<-->O
I strongly believe that God created us and that we are subjected to His laws and must obey .<-->O
The laws of God that have the worst punishment deal with bringing life into the world and taking life out of the world .<-->N
I believe that cloning people would fall under these laws also .<-->O
Cloning tissues and organs falls under a different category that cloning human beings .<-->N
I think it would be advantageous to science and medicine to clone tissues and organs .<-->O
However , the research in this involves fetal tissue which is a completely different ethical discussion .<-->N
I do not know enough about the procedure be against it .<-->O
So , with my present understanding I would allow cloning for tissues and organs .<-->O
Cloning can revolutionize the world and the way we live or it may be so minimal that it would not affect us at all if it is allowed .<-->O
-LSB- Two sentences taken out during update . -RSB-<-->N
Is this the world you want to live in ?<-->N
Each person individually must decide for himself or herself if they believe that cloning should be allowed or if the governments should intervene with it .<-->O
This House would permit the use of performance enhancing drugs in professional sports At least as far back as Ben Johnson 's steroid scandal at the 1988 Olympics , the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports had entered the public psyche .<-->O
Johnson 's world record sprint , his win , and then , the stripping of his gold medal made news around the world .<-->N
However , performance-enhancing drugs in sports do not begin with Johnson .<-->N
A quick overview of drugs in sports reveals the earlier use of questionable substances ; some even argue that drugs in sports date back to the earliest Olympic games In order to make any sense of all of this we must first understand what sport is and the reasons why some athletes take performance enhancing drugs and other do not .<-->O
Sport was never meant to be what it has become into today .<-->N
It was never meant to be about winning , losing , training , fame , elitism , or how much adrenaline you get when doing it .<-->O
The concept of sport was made as a celebration of our evolutionary capabilities .<-->N
From a young age we naturally start to move .<-->N
From crawling to walking , running , and climbing .<-->N
Yet somewhere along the way movement became less fun and exciting .<-->O
It became more of an obligation and focused more on the superficial outcome .<-->N
This is what sport has become into .<-->N
I 've known a lot of good athletes that loved their sport but got discouraged because they lost their joy and passion for it .<-->O
Charles Moreland makes a great point saying `` Too much emphasis is placed on the trophy .<-->O
Too much emphasis is placed on that perfect ten .<-->N
Too much emphasis is placed on that A + .<-->N
Our system of achievement is n't fun .<-->N
Its boring and outdated .<-->N
It is what motivates athletes to take steroids and encourages our kids to regurgitate information like machines rather than actually learn something .<-->O
In the same way fitness today is no longer a celibration of our evolutionary capibilities .<-->N
Rather a forced act designed to burn calories and get that six pack everyone wants .<-->N
As a personal trainer I feel obligated to say that our form of fitness today has failed us .<-->N
Its no longer interesting .<-->N
We need TV 's on treadmills to encourage people to use them .<-->O
We hire people like myself to tell you why you should exercise and what exactly to do rather than answering tht question for yourself ... In our version of fitness emphasis is placed on the superficial outcome of the exercise not the exercise itself . ''<-->O
The real problem is not the athletes .<-->N
It is about how they are being trained .<-->N
They lose their passion and joy for the sport and turn to different methods to achive their goal .<-->O
A goal not set by themselves but influenced by the world around them .<-->N
They feel pressured to be the best they can to fulfill someone elses expectation .<-->O
They are trained to get results not to have fun .<-->N
To think only about the outcome not the enjoyment of the present .<-->O
They enjoy the superficial outcome but not the movement itself .<-->N
A solution would be to make sure athletes are educated on this matter and shown unbiased discisions .<-->O
This may not stop athletes from taking drugs but it can potentially lower its rate .<-->N
Another option could be to fully cater to those that take performance enhancing drugs by making a completely different leage for them .<-->O
This way there is no form of `` cheating '' as both sides will have an equal playing field .<-->N
Bengt Kayser , MD , PhD , Professor of Exercise Physiology , and Alexandre Mauron , PhD , Professor of Bioethics , both at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva , Switzerland , along with Andy Miah , PhD , Reader in New Media and Bioethics at the School of Media , Language , and Music at the University of the West of Scotland , UK , in their Dec. 2005 The Lancet article `` Viewpoint : Legalisation of Performance-Enhancing Drugs , '' wrote : `` Antidoping policies exist , in theory , to encourage fair play .<-->N
However , we believe they are unfounded , dangerous , and excessively costly ... We believe that rather than drive doping underground , use of drugs should be permitted under medical supervision .<-->O
Legalisation of the use of drugs in sport might even have some advantages .<-->O
The boundary between the therapeutic and ergogenic - ie , performance enhancing - use of drugs is blurred at present and poses difficult questions for the controlling bodies of antidoping practice and for sports doctors .<-->N
The antidoping rules often lead to complicated and costly administrative and medical follow-up to ascertain whether drugs taken by athletes are legitimate therapeutic agents or illicit .<-->O
... Furthermore , legalisation of doping , we believe , would encourage more sensible , informed use of drugs in amateur sport , leading to an overall decline in the rate of health problems associated with doping .<-->O
Finally , by allowing medically supervised doping , the drugs used could be assessed for a clearer view of what is dangerous and what is not ... Acknowledging the importance of rules in sports , which might include the prohibition of doping , is , in itself , not problematic .<-->O
However , a problem arises when the application of these rules is beset with diminishing returns : escalating costs and questionable effectiveness . ''<-->O
Bennett Foddy , DPhil , Harold T. Shapiro Postdoctoral Fellowship in Bioethics at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University , and Julian Savulescu , PhD , Professor and Uehiro Chair in Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford , in their June 2007 Principle of Health Care Ethics article `` Ethics of Performance Enhancement in Sport : Drugs and Gene Doping , '' wrote : `` It would be much easier to eliminate the anti-doping rules than to eliminate doping .<-->O
The current policy against doping has proved expensive and difficult to police .<-->O
In the near future it may become impossible to police .<-->N
... Because doping is illegal , the pressure is to make performance enhancers undetectable , rather than safe .<-->O
Performance enhancers are produced or bought on the black market and administered in a clandestine , uncontrolled way with no monitoring of the athlete s health .<-->O
Allowing the use of performance enhancers would make sport safer as there would be less pressure on athletes to take unsafe enhancers and a pressure to develop new safe performance enhancers and to make existing enhancers more effective at safe dosages ... The removal of doping controls would have major benefits : less cheating , increased solidarity and respect between athletes , more focus on sport and not on rules .<-->O
-LSB- I -RSB- n order to justify the current doping controls , these arguments have to justify the ban s yearly multi-million dollar cost , and the intangible costs , and they must outweigh the benefits we would get if we abolished doping controls .<-->O
We should focus on health of athletes , not performance enhancement .<-->N
Rather than attempting to detect undetectable enhancers , we should spend our limited resources on evaluating health and fitness to compete .<-->N
There are good reasons to allow performance enhancement , to make sport fairer -LRB- in the sense that the rules are equally applied -RRB- and to narrow the gap between the cheaters and the honest athletes .<-->O
It would provide a better spectacle , be safer and less coercive . ''<-->O
Adrianne Blue , Senior Lecturer in the Department of Journalism and Publishing at City University London , UK , in her Aug. 14 , 2006 New Statesman article `` It 's the Real Dope , '' wrote : `` Today , sport 's dirty little secret is drugs , and it is high time we made them legal .<-->O
Performance-enhancing drugs may not be desirable , but they are here to stay .<-->N
What we can do away with is the hypocrisy .<-->N
Insiders know that many - perhaps most - top players in all sports take drugs to train harder and feel no pain during play .<-->O
The trainers , sports doctors , nutritionists , physiotherapists and managers of the big names make sure banned substances are taken at the safest and most efficient levels , and when they can , the governing bodies look the other way ... What many of us do n't realise is that sports doping rarely gives you a free ride .<-->O
If you or I were to take anabolic steroids and sit down in front of the telly , we would not build muscle or speed or endurance .<-->N
Drugs allow you to train harder .<-->N
They help you recover more quickly from a hard session so you can work hard again the next day .<-->O
Some drugs boost the body 's propensity for building muscle or its ability to use oxygen , but you still have to do the work ... Tales of sport doping go back to ancient Egypt , where the hoof of an Abyssinian ass ground up and boiled in oil was prescribed to improve performance .<-->O
In the 19th century , boxers took heroin before going into the ring .<-->N
The legendary 1960s Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg has confessed that he took amphetamines before matches ... The main effect of banning such substances has been to turn performers and their coaches into liars and cheats .<-->O
We should legalise performance-enhancing drugs so that they can be regulated and athletes on the way up - whose entourages do not yet include savvy physiotherapists and doctors - do n't overdose and do themselves damage . ''<-->O
Radley Balko , Senior Editor of Reason magazine , in the Jan. 15 , 2008 Intelligence Squared US debate titled `` We Should Accept Performance-Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports , '' moderated by Bob Costas , stated : `` As we 've seen with government bans on consensual activity - from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution - prohibitions not only do n't work , they make the activity in question more dangerous by pushing it underground ... Our society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with pharmaceuticals and medical technology .<-->O
If something can be said to be ` natural ' , we tend to be okay with it .<-->O
If it seems lab-made or synthetic we tend to be leery .<-->N
But even synthetic drugs and manmade technology seem to be okay if the aim is to make sick or broken people whole again ... It 's also important to note that we consider perfectly natural and acceptable today was quite out of the ordinary not so long ago .<-->O
100 years ago , life expectancy in the U.S. was 50 years of age .<-->N
Today it 's 78 .<-->N
Thanks to technology , medicine , and pharmaceuticals we are today taller , stronger , faster , healthier , and can expect to live longer than ever before ... Sports is about exploring and stretching the limits of human potential .<-->N
Going back even to the pre-modern Olympics , when athletes ate live bees and ate crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition , sports has never been some wholesome display of physical ability alone .<-->O
Ingenuity , innovation , and knowledge about what makes us faster and stronger -LRB- and avoiding what might do more harm than good -RRB- has always been a part of the game ... ... -LSB- A -RSB- free society is n't really free at all if it does n't include the freedom to make what some may believe are bad decisions . ''<-->O
Jan. 15 , 2008 - Radley Balko Gary Cartwright , writer for the Texas Monthly , in the magazine 's Apr. 2008 article `` Truth and Consequences : Yes , Roger Clemens Is a Jerk .<-->N
But Congress Should n't Make a Federal Case Over Whether He Lied About Using Steroids , '' wrote : `` Who among us has n't used performance enhancers , preferably with ice and an olive ?<-->N
Steroids , synthetic substances similar to testosterone , can be as benign as those that are commonly prescribed for allergies and as harmful as those that have sent many retired athletes into physical decline ; as with any medication , the effect depends on the dose and frequency of use ... For the most part , however , the only thing certifiably bad about steroids is that they may improve athletic performance .<-->O
Somehow we 've decided that the only hardworking professionals who should n't be permitted to enhance their performances are athletes .<-->N
Amphetamines were staples in professional training rooms in the sixties and seventies ... Then there is the myth that steroids are turning players into freaks .<-->N
Players have always been freaks .<-->N
That 's what makes them so different from the rest of us .<-->N
No normal person can throw a baseball 98 miles an hour .<-->N
Normal people ca n't run a slant-in and catch a football with a 250-pound linebacker waiting to cream them ... It is time to admit that not all steroids are dangerous and that every individual and every situation can not be addressed with the same set of rigid rules .<-->O
Instead of banning steroids , we should control them .<-->N
Cool the hysteria ; educate without scaring . ''<-->N
Jay P. Granat , PhD , Psychotherapist and Founder of StayInTheZone.com , in the Sep. 23 , 2007 Sunday show titled `` Doping in Sports - Here To Stay ? ''<-->N
on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation -LRB- CBC -RRB- News , stated -LSB- as transcribed by ProCon.org -RSB- : `` One of my main objections to doping is that it s dangerous .<-->N
Doping can cause blood clots , hurt our immune system , and it can create strokes and infections .<-->O
So it s quite dangerous .<-->N
Secondly , I ve treated a number of athletes who have involved with doping and anabolic steroid use , and I can tell you that clinically these people present just like addicts , and we don t need more addicts in sports we don t need more addicts in society .<-->O
I think this -LSB- allowing doping in sports -RSB- would be a mistake .<-->O
I think we would be opening the floodgates .<-->N
Young people will model and imitate what they see people do .<-->N
They ll get involved with this at an earlier and earlier stage in life .<-->N
And then we re going to have some deaths , and some problems , and we re going to feel kind of bad about loosening the regulations .<-->O
The purity of sports , the beauty of sports is about athletes competing with a sound mind and a sound body .<-->O
We don t want the athlete with the best chemist , best pharmacist , or the best transfusionist to be the champion . ''<-->O
Tom Davis , JD , US Representative -LRB- R-VA -RRB- , was quoted in his May 26 , 2005 news article `` McCain , Davis , and Waxman Announce Introduction of ` Clean Sports Act of 2005 ' , '' published on tomdavis.house.gov , as having said : `` Two months ago , the Government Reform Committee held our first hearing on steroids , looking into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball ... We know this is a national public health crisis .<-->O
We are here today to announce the introduction of legislation that is aimed at not only getting rid of performance enhancing drugs on the professional level , but also to send a message loud and clear to the young people of America : Steroids are illegal .<-->O
Steroids are dangerous .<-->N
They can be deadly .<-->N
And there is no place for them in our sports leagues or on our school grounds . ''<-->N
George Michael , creator and former host of Sports Machine on NBC , in the Jan. 15 , 2007 Intelligence Squared US debate titled `` We Should Accept Performance-Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports , '' moderated by Bob Costas , stated : '' -LSB- I -RSB- n 2002 ... 17 percent of total baseball payroll went to guys who were on the injured list with muscle tears , muscle strains , ruptured Achilles tendon , and on goes the list .<-->N
-LSB- Dr. James Andrews -RSB- said that we have had a 200 percent increase in just the five years prior to 2002 .<-->N
Baseball owners paid $ 370 million to players who were not able to play .<-->N
Most of them according to Dr. Andrews , were related to their use of anabolic steroids .<-->N
And you now want to admit -- legalize it , and govern it ?<-->O
... I 'm probably the only guy in the room who is friends with professional wrestlers , I started in 1980 with Bob Backlund ... Guys that are just names to you like Hulk Hogan , Ricky Steamboat , Nature Boy , Rick Flair , these are all friends of mine .<-->O
I wanted to call and check with some of the wrestlers I used to know , how they 're doing today .<-->N
How 'd they recover after the use of steroids .<-->N
I went to call them and you know what I found ?<-->N
Of the wrestlers who were professional stars , 40 were dead by the age of 40 .<-->N
70 were dead by the age of 50 .<-->N
But there 's no clinical proof that they died of steroid abuse even though they all used steroids .<-->O
Here 's the bottom line .<-->N
I am not willing to pay the price for legalizing steroids and performance-enhancing drugs , because I 've seen too often what it can do .<-->N
I do n't want to go to the cemetery and tell all the athletes who are dead there , hey guys , soon you 'll have a lot more of your friends coming , because we 're going to legalize this stuff .<-->O
The only good news out of it ?<-->N
They would n't hear the news .<-->N
Because they 're all dead . ''<-->N
Carl Djerassi , PhD , Professor Emeritus in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University , in his Oct. 7 , 2007 San Francisco Chronicle article `` Athletes and Steroids : Will Tomorrow 's Game Involve Drug Advisers ?<-->N
, '' wrote : `` Though logical , such acceptance or legalization of performance-enhancing aids has serious ramifications .<-->O
I predict that a new subset of drugs - for which I propose the term ` lusuceuticals ' ... will arise .<-->N
These new drugs will follow the model of commercially successful products labeled ` nutraceuticals ' and ` cosmeceuticals ' that have already crossed the sharply defined boundaries of standard pharmaceuticals designed to treat diseases ... But will lusu-chemists ... limit themselves to much safer anabolic drugs , now that detectability will be of no concern ?<-->O
Or will they head into much more questionable directions , such as growth hormone analogs that will lead to 71/2-foot-tall pole vaulters or basketball players ?<-->O
... Whatever we do in terms of legalizing drug abuse in athletics , we are heading in the direction of changing the Olympics from a competition of athletes to one of chemists , where the emphasis will shift abruptly from body to mind ... As a chemist , I ought to welcome such a prospect , because the mind does not deteriorate as rapidly as the body .<-->O
Nevertheless , I dread such a future . ''<-->N
Oct. 7 , 2007 - Carl Djerassi , PhD Joe Lindsey , Contributing Writer for Bicycling magazine , in his article `` Why Legalizing Sports Doping Wo n't Work , '' published on July 27 , 2007 in the New York Times column `` Freakonomics '' by Stephen J. Dubner , wrote : `` One , not all cyclists dope , nor do they want to ... The vast majority of cyclists who would prefer to race clean ... are instead tempted to dope simply to keep up with the small minority who aggressively dope for a competitive advantage ... Modern oxygen-vector doping is so effective , a rider has two choices : dope and keep up , or stay clean and fall behind ... Second , not all doping techniques are created equal .<-->O
The most effective regimens are also the most sophisticated and expensive ... So if doping is legalized , the sport 's richest riders and teams will have access to techniques that lesser lights do n't .<-->O
The playing field , never level , would be tilted permanently .<-->N
Medical laws and medical ethics prevent us from letting athletes use these substances outside of a clinical trial .<-->N
But athletes , who eagerly seek out anything that will give them a competitive edge , will still try and get them ... Simply put , wherever you draw the line , something , some technique or substance , will always be off-limits .<-->O
And so you 've merely moved the line , not erased it ... Finally , none of that addresses the moral problems involved in legalizing doping .<-->O
Doping in sports is n't inherently wrong ; it 's wrong by the value system with which we judge sports .<-->O
Sports themselves are by their nature civilized : everyone agrees to follow a certain set of rules .<-->N
If you do n't , that 's cheating .<-->N
Legalizing doping does n't change those rules as much as remove them altogether , and then it 's no longer a sport , but merely entertainment .<-->O
Right or wrong , we look to sports and to athletes for an inspiration that mere entertainment can not provide - there is an implicit contract that the sweat and effort we see before us is real and natural .<-->O
Do you want to see who 's the best athlete , or just who had the best access to pharmaceutical enhancement ? ''<-->O
Thomas H. Murray , PhD , President of the Hastings Center , in the chapter `` Sports Enhancement '' published in the 2008-2009 From Birth to Death and Bench to Clinic : The Hastings Center Bioethics Briefing Book for Journalists , Policymakers , and Campaigns , wrote : `` There are several reasons to ban performance-enhancing drugs : respect for the rules of sports , recognition that natural talents and their perfection are the point of sports , and the prospect of an ` arms race ' in athletic performance .<-->O
... The rules in each sport in effect determine which characteristics among all possible sources of difference influence who wins and who loses ... Many innovations that would surely improve performance are banned outright .<-->O
An athlete who showed up for the Boston Marathon wearing Rollerblades would be wheeled right off the start line ... Rules are changed at times to preserve a sport .<-->O
Basketball banned goaltending swatting the ball away just as it was about to go into the hoop when players became so tall and athletic that they could stand by the basket and prevent most shots from having a chance to go in ... When performance-enhancing drugs have the power to overcome differences in natural talents and the willingness to sacrifice and persevere in the quest to perfect those talents , we can not avoid confronting the question , What do we value in sport ?<-->O
Emerging technologies from hypoxic chambers and carbon fiber prostheses to genetic manipulation will force us -LSB- to -RSB- consider what , after all , is the point of sport ?<-->O
... Sports that revere records and historical comparisons -LRB- think of baseball and home runs -RRB- would become unmoored by drug-aided athletes obliterating old standards .<-->O
Athletes , caught in the sport arms race , would be pressed to take more and more drugs , in ever wilder combinations and at increasingly higher doses ... The drug race in sport has the potential to create a slow-motion public health catastrophe .<-->O
Finally , we may lose whatever is most graceful , beautiful , and admirable about sport ... '' Whats the difference ?<-->O
Athletes have always tried/consumed different things in order to try to gain an edge on their competition .<-->N
Twenty years ago football players would eat steak and mash-potatoes before games thinking that the carbs and protein would help them have energy throughout the game .<-->O
That was not unfair or cheating .<-->N
Now we could even look at Gatorade as an example .<-->O
They have thrived off of athletes desire to be better or more prepared than the competition .<-->O
There are a few reasons why performance enhancing drugs are not yet legal .<-->N
One , we do not know all of the side effects of the drugs and it may be dangerous , however if they are legalized then they would be used under closer supervision and there would not be as many accidents .<-->O
Two , there is already a precedence set in the world of sports and performance enhancing drugs , and three , we believe that it would be unfair .<-->O
But lets face it , if they were legalized , then everyone would be using them -LRB- as if the majority are not already -RRB- and it would be just as fair as it is now .<-->O
The Goal of Competition The goal of competition is to see who is the best of the best in whatever event is being competed in .<-->O
The winner is the one with the best training , talent , and willpower .<-->O
The winner should n't be the one with the most potent cocktail mix in their system - Promoting cheating for results over working hard would ruin the entire sports community .<-->O
No longer would athletes be role-models for children .<-->N
They would be druggies hyped up off of body and mind-jacking steroids and the like .<-->N
No enhancing drugs !<-->N
I think that performance enhancing drugs should not be used in professional sports because you never see the player 's real skill .<-->O
If a five-year-old used enough enhancing drugs , he could hit it out of the park .<-->N
Also , it gives the players who do not use drugs an unfair disadvantage , as they will seem not as good .<-->O
All the more better Once steroid usage is legalized we will able to see the human limits pushed to the extremes .<-->O
More homeruns will be hit , more touchdowns will scored , and faster sprint times will be achieved .<-->O
This benefits both the entertainer and the viewers .<-->N
According to article on www.cleveland.com Mehlman argued , There is nothing fundamentally wrong or ethically objectionable to PEDs .<-->O
Players will get more fans and the team will have more sponsors .<-->O
Also , using steroids is not cheating .<-->N
Otherwise , using supplements like protein shakes would be cheating too .<-->O
However , it is not .<-->N
Steroid is just another supplement that professional sports players should be allowed to use .<-->O
Cheating is defined by Webster s dictionary as gaining the upper advantage .<-->N
This means that every player in a sport should train , work , and eat the same because he should not have the advantage .<-->O
And that is unrealistic .<-->N
If they are to be truly equal then the game would be pointless .<-->O
However , if steroids are legalized the players be on a completely different level we have never seen before .<-->N
And then it wouldn t be cheating anymore because no one has the upper advantage .<-->N
Every player would try to overcome the other competitors .<-->O
Thus , makes the game more amusing to watch .<-->N
Performance enhancement drug do not ruin the spirit of the sport .<-->O
According to an article on ABC news The spirit of sport embodies excellence , teamwork , fair play , commitment , respect for people and rules , and fun .<-->O
And PEDs do not interfere with that .<-->N
What were sports originally started for ?<-->N
Its the competition of who has the best body given to them .<-->N
If they become chemically enhanced , there is no more level playing ground , and the competition has now become obsolete .<-->N
Its the battle of the bodies at their most basic level , without unnatural enhancement .<-->O
If someone gains strength through lifting weight , that is their bodies natural ability to gain muscle mass .<-->O
Gaining muscle mass though drugs makes a muscle 's performance in comparable , because an athlete who does n't use performance enhancing drugs requires more work done to reach the same level of performance as someone who reaches an equal ground , which is unfair , and eliminates the original premise behind why sports came to be .<-->O
That is basically cheating . .<-->N
It 's taking the whole purpose of the game away .<-->N
Vince Lombardi said if winning isnt everything , why do we keep track of score ?<-->N
Drugs period can lead to many health issues and taking performance enhancing drugs basically shows that the athlete taking them does n't care about the game and only care about him/herself and the money and the fame .<-->O
And last time i checked , most drugs are illegal Everyone should be enhanced .<-->O
Professional sports would be much more entertaining if the athletes used enhancements in addition to hard work .<-->O
With their hard work , they can only get so strong , fast , etc. .<-->O
However , there should be enhancement only leagues and non-enhancement only leagues where players compete against others like themselves .<-->O
There would be the normal league , with normal sized players and the enhanced league , where linemen are 6 ' 9 450 , receivers have 50 + inch verticals , and running backs run sub 4 second 40s .<-->O
what makes sport enjoyable to the public .<-->N
The reason people enjoy sport is because it is a demonstration of what other fellow human beings can achieve and what humans can achieve collectively , as a species .<-->O
A spectacle is designed to amaze .<-->N
It doesn t need to be human achievement to be amazing -LRB- no one would call monster truck driving a sport -RRB- .<-->O
So , when humans start taking drugs to improve performance , it is no longer a sport , it is a spectacle , because there is no human physical achievement , but instead a chemical achievement .<-->O
It also becomes a celebration not of human physical achievement , but of human intellectual achievement , of who can design the best drugs .<-->O
Even with fancy running shoes , we are still celebrating human achievement , which will not happen once you take it to the extreme of allowing drug use .<-->O
This doesn t benefit athletes in the long run .<-->N
Athletes won t be celebrated but scientists will !<-->O
Once some people choose to use drugs to enhance their performance , other athletes have their freedom of choice infringed upon : if they want to succeed they have to take drugs too .<-->O
Athletes are very driven individuals , who would go to great lengths to achieve their goals .<-->O
The chance of a gold medal in two years time may out-weigh the risks of serious health problems for the rest of their life .<-->O
We should protect athletes from themselves and not allow anyone to take performance-enhancing drugs .<-->O
An example of the pressure is cycling .<-->N
The American Scientific magazine explains : Game theory highlights why it is rational for professional cyclists to dope : the drugs are extremely effective as well as difficult or impossible to detect ; the payoffs for success are high ; and as more riders use them , a clean rider may become so noncompetitive that he or she risks being cut from the team .<-->O
Even if performance-enhancing drugs were only legalized for adults , the definition of this varies from country to country , something which would be problematic for sports that are global .<-->N
Teenage athletes train alongside adult ones and share the same coaches , so many would succumb to the temptation and pressures to use drugs , if these were widely available and effectively endorsed by legalization .<-->O
Not only are such young athletes unable to make a fully rational , informed choice about drug-taking , the health impacts upon growing bodies would be even worse than for adult users .<-->O
It would also send a positive message about drug culture in general , making the use of recreational drugs with all their accompanying evils more widespread .<-->O
In the spirit of competition .<-->N
Consider that an athlete consumed some form of performance enhancing drug , say , steroids .<-->N
Now , they play a game , say , football .<-->N
Despite the consumption of ` roids , an opponent beats them .<-->N
Not only has the athlete consumed a drug in order to enhance skills they fear are not adequate , it has been proven that even with enhancement there is someone even better than they are .<-->O
Thus , it sheds light on the truly talented players , who are capable of defeating an enhanced opponent Why we should allow performance enhancing drugs in sport The legalisation of drugs in sport may be fairer and safer In 490 BC , the Persian Army landed on the plain of Marathon , 25 miles from Athens .<-->O
The Athenians sent a messenger named Feidipides to Sparta to ask for help .<-->N
He ran the 150 miles in two days .<-->F
The Spartans were late .<-->N
The Athenians attacked and , although outnumbered five to one , were victorious .<-->N
Feidipides was sent to run back to Athens to report victory .<-->N
On arrival , he screamed We won and dropped dead from exhaustion .<-->N
The marathon was run in the first modern Olympics in 1896 , and in many ways the athletic ideal of modern athletes is inspired by the myth of the marathon .<-->O
Their ideal is superhuman performance , at any cost .<-->N
DRUGS IN SPORT The use of performance enhancing drugs in the modern Olympics is on record as early as the games of the third Olympiad , when Thomas Hicks won the marathon after receiving an injection of strychnine in the middle of the race .1 The first official ban on stimulating substances by a sporting organisation was introduced by the International Amateur Athletic Federation in 1928.2 Using drugs to cheat in sport is not new , but it is becoming more effective .<-->O
In 1976 , the East German swimming team won 11 out of 13 Olympic events , and later sued the government for giving them anabolic steroids .3 Yet despite the health risks , and despite the regulating bodies attempts to eliminate drugs from sport , the use of illegal substances is widely known to be rife .<-->O
It hardly raises an eyebrow now when some famous athlete fails a dope test .<-->O
In 1992 , Vicky Rabinowicz interviewed small groups of athletes .<-->N
She found that Olympic athletes , in general , believed that most successful athletes were using banned substances .4 Much of the writing on the use of drugs in sport is focused on this kind of anecdotal evidence .<-->O
There is very little rigorous , objective evidence because the athletes are doing something that is taboo , illegal , and sometimes highly dangerous .<-->O
The anecdotal picture tells us that our attempts to eliminate drugs from sport have failed .<-->N
In the absence of good evidence , we need an analytical argument to determine what we should do .<-->O
CONDEMNED TO CHEATING ?<-->N
We are far from the days of amateur sporting competition .<-->N
Elite athletes can earn tens of millions of dollars every year in prize money alone , and millions more in sponsorships and endorsements .<-->N
The lure of success is great .<-->O
But the penalties for cheating are small .<-->N
A six month or one year ban from competition is a small penalty to pay for further years of multimillion dollar success .<-->O
Drugs are much more effective today than they were in the days of strychnine and sheep s testicles .<-->N
Studies involving the anabolic steroid androgen showed that , even in doses much lower than those used by athletes , muscular strength could be improved by 5 20 % .5 Most athletes are also relatively unlikely to ever undergo testing .<-->O
The International Amateur Athletic Federation estimates that only 10 15 % of participating athletes are tested in each major competition .6 The enormous rewards for the winner , the effectiveness of the drugs , and the low rate of testing all combine to create a cheating game that is irresistible to athletes .<-->O
Kjetil Haugen7 investigated the suggestion that athletes face a kind of prisoner s dilemma regarding drugs .<-->O
His game theoretic model shows that , unless the likelihood of athletes being caught doping was raised to unrealistically high levels , or the payoffs for winning were reduced to unrealistically low levels , athletes could all be predicted to cheat .<-->O
The current situation for athletes ensures that this is likely , even though they are worse off as a whole if everyone takes drugs , than if nobody takes drugs .<-->O
Drugs such as erythropoietin -LRB- EPO -RRB- and growth hormone are natural chemicals in the body .<-->N
As technology advances , drugs have become harder to detect because they mimic natural processes .<-->N
In a few years , there will be many undetectable drugs .<-->N
Haugen s analysis predicts the obvious : that when the risk of being caught is zero , athletes will all choose to cheat .<-->O
The recent Olympic games in Athens were the first to follow the introduction of a global anti-doping code .<-->N
From the lead up to the games to the end of competition , 3000 drug tests were carried out : 2600 urine tests and 400 blood tests for the endurance enhancing drug EPO .8 From these , 23 athletes were found to have taken a banned substance the most ever in an Olympic games .9 Ten of the men s weightlifting competitors were excluded .<-->N
The goal of cleaning up the sport is unattainable .<-->N
Further down the track the spectre of genetic enhancement looms dark and large .<-->O
THE SPIRIT OF SPORT So is cheating here to stay ?<-->N
Drugs are against the rules .<-->F
But we define the rules of sport .<-->N
If we made drugs legal and freely available , there would be no cheating .<-->N
The World Anti-Doping Agency code declares a drug illegal if it is performance enhancing , if it is a health risk , or if it violates the spirit of sport .10 They define this spirit as follows .11 The spirit of sport is the celebration of the human spirit , body , and mind , and is characterised by the following values : ethics , fair play and honesty health excellence in performance character and education fun and joy teamwork dedication and commitment respect for rules and laws respect for self and other participants courage community and solidarity Would legal and freely available drugs violate this spirit ?<-->O
Would such a permissive rule be good for sport ?<-->N
Human sport is different from sports involving other animals , such as horse or dog racing .<-->N
The goal of a horse race is to find the fastest horse .<-->F
Horses are lined up and flogged .<-->N
The winner is the one with the best combination of biology , training , and rider .<-->N
Basically , this is a test of biological potential .<-->N
This was the old naturalistic Athenian vision of sport : find the strongest , fastest , or most skilled man .<-->N
Training aims to bring out this potential .<-->N
Drugs that improve our natural potential are against the spirit of this model of sport .<-->O
But this is not the only view of sport .<-->N
Humans are not horses or dogs .<-->N
We make choices and exercise our own judgment .<-->N
We choose what kind of training to use and how to run our race .<-->N
We can display courage , determination , and wisdom .<-->O
We are not flogged by a jockey on our back but drive ourselves .<-->N
It is this judgment that competitors exercise when they choose diet , training , and whether to take drugs .<-->N
We can choose what kind of competitor to be , not just through training , but through biological manipulation .<-->O
Human sport is different from animal sport because it is creative .<-->N
Far from being against the spirit of sport , biological manipulation embodies the human spirit the capacity to improve ourselves on the basis of reason and judgment .<-->O
When we exercise our reason , we do what only humans do .<-->N
The result will be that the winner is not the person who was born with the best genetic potential to be strongest .<-->O
Sport would be less of a genetic lottery .<-->N
The winner will be the person with a combination of the genetic potential , training , psychology , and judgment .<-->O
Olympic performance would be the result of human creativity and choice , not a very expensive horse race .<-->O
Classical musicians commonly use blockers to control their stage fright .<-->N
These drugs lower heart rate and blood pressure , reducing the physical effects of stress , and it has been shown that the quality of a musical performance is improved if the musician takes these drugs .12 Although elite classical music is arguably as competitive as elite sport , and the rewards are similar , there is no stigma attached to the use of these drugs .<-->O
We do not think less of the violinist or pianist who uses them .<-->N
If the audience judges the performance to be improved with drugs , then the drugs are enabling the musician to express him or herself more effectively .<-->N
The competition between elite musicians has rules you can not mime the violin to a backing CD .<-->N
But there is no rule against the use of chemical enhancements .<-->N
Is classical music a good metaphor for elite sport ?<-->N
Sachin Tendulkar is known as the Maestro from Mumbai .<-->N
The Associated Press called Maria Sharapova s 2004 Wimbledon final a virtuoso performance .13 Jim Murray14 wrote the following about Michael Jordan in 1996 : You go to see Michael Jordan play for the same reason you went to see Astaire dance , Olivier act or the sun set over Canada .<-->N
It s art .<-->N
It should be painted , not photographed.It s not a game , it s a recital .<-->N
He s not just a player , he s a virtuoso .<-->O
Heifetz with a violin .<-->N
Horowitz at the piano .<-->N
Indeed , it seems reasonable to suggest that the reasons we appreciate sport at its elite level have something to do with competition , but also a great deal to do with the appreciation of an extraordinary performance .<-->O
Clearly the application of this kind of creativity is limited by the rules of the sport .<-->N
Riding a motorbike would not be a creative solution to winning the Tour de France , and there are good reasons for proscribing this in the rules .<-->O
If motorbikes were allowed , it would still be a good sport , but it would no longer be a bicycle race .<-->O
We should not think that allowing cyclists to take EPO would turn the Tour de France into some kind of drug race , any more than the various training methods available turn it into a training race or a money race .<-->O
Athletes train in different , creative ways , but ultimately they still ride similar bikes , on the same course .<-->O
The skill of negotiating the steep winding descent will always be there .<-->O
People do well at sport as a result of the genetic lottery that happened to deal them a winning hand .<-->N
Genetic tests are available to identify those with the greatest potential .<-->N
If you have one version of the ACE gene , you will be better at long distance events .<-->O
If you have another , you will be better at short distance events .<-->O
Black Africans do better at short distance events because of biologically superior muscle type and bone structure .<-->O
Sport discriminates against the genetically unfit .<-->N
Sport is the province of the genetic elite -LRB- or freak -RRB- .<-->N
The starkest example is the Finnish skier Eero Maentyranta .<-->N
In 1964 , he won three gold medals .<-->N
Subsequently it was found he had a genetic mutation that meant that he naturally had 40 50 % more red blood cells than average .15 Was it fair that he had significant advantage given to him by chance ?<-->O
The ability to perform well in sporting events is determined by the ability to deliver oxygen to muscles .<-->O
Oxygen is carried by red blood cells .<-->N
The more red blood cells , the more oxygen you can carry .<-->N
This in turn controls an athlete s performance in aerobic exercise .<-->N
EPO is a natural hormone that stimulates red blood cell production , raising the packed cell volume -LRB- PCV -RRB- the percentage of the blood comprised of red blood cells .<-->O
EPO is produced in response to anaemia , haemorrhage , pregnancy , or living at altitude .<-->N
Athletes began injecting recombinant human EPO in the 1970s , and it was officially banned in 1985.16 At sea level , the average person has a PCV of 0.4 0.5 .<-->N
It naturally varies ; 5 % of people have a packed cell volume above 0.5,17 and that of elite athletes is more likely to exceed 0.5 , either because their high packed cell volume has led them to success in sport or because of their training .18 Raising the PCV too high can cause health problems .<-->O
The risk of harm rapidly rises as PCV gets above 50 % .<-->O
One study showed that in men whose PCV was 0.51 or more , risk of stroke was significantly raised -LRB- relative risk ?<-->N
2.5 -RRB- , after adjustment for other causes of stroke .19 At these levels , raised PCV combined with hypertension would cause a ninefold increase in stroke risk .<-->N
In endurance sports , dehydration causes an athlete s blood to thicken , further raising blood viscosity and pressure .20 What begins as a relatively low risk of stroke or heart attack can rise acutely during exercise .<-->O
In the early 1990s , after EPO doping gained popularity but before tests for its presence were available , several Dutch cyclists died in their sleep due to inexplicable cardiac arrest .<-->N
This has been attributed to high levels of EPO doping .21 The risks from raising an athlete s PCV too high are real and serious .<-->O
Use of EPO is endemic in cycling and many other sports .<-->N
In 1998 , the Festina team was expelled from the Tour de France after trainer Willy Voet was caught with 400 vials of performance enhancing drugs .22 The following year , the World Anti-Doping Agency was established as a result of the scandal .<-->N
However , EPO is extremely hard to detect and its use has continued .<-->N
Italy s Olympic anti-doping director observed in 2003 that the amount of EPO sold in Italy outweighed the amount needed for sick people by a factor of six .23 In addition to trying to detect EPO directly , the International Cycling Union requires athletes to have a PCV no higher than 0.5 .<-->N
But 5 % of people naturally have a PCV higher than 0.5 .<-->N
Athletes with a naturally high PCV can not race unless doctors do a number of tests to show that their PCV is natural .<-->O
Charles Wegelius was a British rider who was banned and then cleared in 2003 .<-->N
He had had his spleen removed in 1998 after an accident , and as the spleen removes red blood cells , its absence resulted in an increased PCV .24 There are other ways to increase the number of red blood cells that are legal .<-->O
Altitude training can push the PCV to dangerous , even fatal , levels .<-->O
More recently , hypoxic air machines have been used to simulate altitude training .<-->N
The body responds by releasing natural EPO and growing more blood cells , so that it can absorb more oxygen with every breath .<-->O
The Hypoxico promotional material quotes Tim Seaman , a US athlete , who claims that the hypoxic air tent has given my blood the legal boost that it needs to be competitive at the world level .<-->O
25 There is one way to boost an athlete s number of red blood cells that is completely undetectable :26 autologous blood doping .<-->O
In this process , athletes remove some blood , and reinject it after their body has made new blood to replace it .<-->N
This method was popular before recombinant human EPO became available .<-->N
By allowing everyone to take performance enhancing drugs , we level the playing field .<-->N
There is no difference between elevating your blood count by altitude training , by using a hypoxic air machine , or by taking EPO .<-->O
But the last is illegal .<-->N
Some competitors have high PCVs and an advantage by luck .<-->O
Some can afford hypoxic air machines .<-->N
Is this fair ?<-->N
Nature is not fair .<-->N
Ian Thorpe has enormous feet which give him an advantage that no other swimmer can get , no matter how much they exercise .<-->O
Some gymnasts are more flexible , and some basketball players are seven feet tall .<-->N
By allowing everyone to take performance enhancing drugs , we level the playing field .<-->N
We remove the effects of genetic inequality .<-->N
Far from being unfair , allowing performance enhancement promotes equality .<-->O
JUST FOR THE RICH ?<-->N
Would this turn sport into a competition of expensive technology ?<-->N
Forget the romantic ancient Greek ideal .<-->O
The Olympics is a business .<-->N
In the four years before the Athens Olympics , Australia spent $ 547 million on sport funding ,27 with $ 13.8 million just to send the Olympic team to Athens .28 With its highest ever funding , the Australian team brought home 17 gold medals , also its highest .<-->O
On these figures , a gold medal costs about $ 32 million .<-->N
Australia came 4th in the medal tally in Athens despite having the 52nd largest population .<-->N
Neither the Australian multicultural genetic heritage nor the flat landscape and desert could have endowed Australians with any special advantage .<-->O
They won because they spent more .<-->N
Money buys success .<-->N
They have already embraced strategies and technologies that are inaccessible to the poor .<-->N
Paradoxically , permitting drugs in sport could reduce economic discrimination .<-->N
The cost of a hypoxic air machine and tent is about US$ 7000.29 Sending an athlete to a high altitude training location for months may be even more expensive .<-->O
This arguably puts legal methods for raising an athlete s PCV beyond the reach of poorer athletes .<-->N
It is the illegal forms that level the playing field in this regard .<-->N
One popular form of recombinant human EPO is called Epogen .<-->N
At the time of writing , the American chain Walgreens offers Epogen for US$ 86 for 6000 international units -LRB- IU -RRB- .<-->N
The maintenance dose of EPO is typically 20 IU per kg body weight , once a week .30 An athlete who weighs 100 kg therefore needs 2000 IU a week , or 8600 IU a month .<-->N
Epogen costs the athlete about US$ 122 a month .<-->N
Even if the Epogen treatment begins four years before an event , it is still cheaper than the hypoxic air machine .<-->N
There are limits on how much haemoglobin an athlete can produce , however much EPO they inject , so there is a natural cap on the amount of money they can spend on this method .<-->O
Meanwhile , in 2000 , the cost of an in competition recombinant EPO test was about US$ 130 per sample .31 This test is significantly more complex than a simple PCV test , which would not distinguish exogenous or endogenous EPO .<-->O
If monetary inequalities are a real concern in sport , then the enormous sums required to test every athlete could instead be spent on grants to provide EPO to poorer athletes , and PCV tests to ensure that athletes have not thickened their blood to unsafe levels .<-->O
Should there be any limits to drugs in sport ?<-->F
There is one limit : safety .<-->N
We do not want an Olympics in which people die before , during , or after competition .<-->N
What matters is health and fitness to compete .<-->N
Rather than testing for drugs , we should focus more on health and fitness to compete .<-->F
Forget testing for EPO , monitor the PCV .<-->N
We need to set a safe level of PCV .<-->O
In the cycling world , that is 0.5 .<-->N
Anyone with a PCV above that level , whether through the use of drugs , training , or natural mutation , should be prevented from participating on safety grounds .<-->O
If someone naturally has a PCV of 0.6 and is allowed to compete , then that risk is reasonable and everyone should be allowed to increase their PCV to 0.6 .<-->O
What matters is what is a safe concentration of growth hormone not whether it is natural or artificial .<-->O
We need to take safety more seriously .<-->O
In the 1960s , East German athletes underwent systematic government sanctioned prescription of anabolic steroids , and were awarded millions of dollars in compensation in 2002 .<-->N
Some of the female athletes had been compelled to change their sex because of the large quantities of testosterone they had been given .32 We should permit drugs that are safe , and continue to ban and monitor drugs that are unsafe .<-->O
There is another argument for this policy based on fairness : provided that a drug is safe , it is unfair to the honest athletes that they have to miss out on an advantage that the cheaters enjoy .<-->O
Taking EPO up to the safe level , say 0.5 , is not a problem .<-->N
This allows athletes to correct for natural inequality .<-->O
There are of course some drugs that are harmful in themselves for example , anabolic steroids .<-->N
We should focus on detecting these because they are harmful not because they enhance performance .<-->O
Far from harming athletes , paradoxically , such a proposal may protect our athletes .<-->O
There would be more rigorous and regular evaluation of an athlete s health and fitness to perform .<-->O
Moreover , the current incentive is to develop undetectable drugs , with little concern for safety .<-->O
If safe performance enhancement drugs were permitted , there would be greater pressure to develop safe drugs .<-->O
Drugs would tend to become safer .<-->N
This is perhaps best illustrated by the case of American sailor Kevin Hall .<-->O
Hall lost his testicles to cancer , meaning that he required testosterone injections to remain healthy .<-->O
As testosterone is an anabolic steroid , he had to prove to four separate governing bodies that he was not using the substance to gain an advantage .33 Any tests that we do should be sensitive to the health of the athlete ; to focus on the substances themselves is dogmatic .<-->O
Not only this , but health testing can help to mitigate the dangers inherent in sport .<-->N
For many athletes , sport is not safe enough without drugs .<-->N
If they suffer from asthma , high blood pressure , or cardiac arrhythmia , sport places their bodies under unique stresses , which raise the likelihood of a chronic or catastrophic harm .<-->O
For example , between 1985 and 1995 , at least 121 US athletes collapsed and died directly after or during a training session or competition most often because they had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or heart malformations .34 The relatively high incidence of sudden cardiac death in young athletes has prompted the American Heart Association to recommend that all athletes undergo cardiac screening before being allowed to train or compete .35 Sometimes , the treatments for these conditions will raise the performance of an athlete beyond that which they could attain naturally .<-->O
But safety should come first .<-->N
If an archer requires blockers to treat heart disease , we should not be concerned that this will give him or her an advantage over other archers .<-->O
Or if an anaemic cyclist wants to take EPO , we should be most concerned with the treatment of the anaemia .<-->O
If we are serious about safety in sport , we should also be prepared to discuss changes to the rules and equipment involved in sports which are themselves inherently dangerous .<-->O
Formula One motor racing , once the most deadly of sports , has not seen a driver death in over six years , largely because of radical changes in the safety engineering of the tracks and the cars .<-->O
Meanwhile , professional boxing remains inherently dangerous ; David Rickman died during a bout in March 2004 , even though he passed a physical examination the day before .36 CHILDREN Linford Christie , who served a two year drug ban from athletics competition , said that athletics is so corrupt now I wouldn t want my child doing it .37 But apart from the moral harms to children in competing in a corrupt sport , should we withhold them from professional sport for medical reasons ?<-->O
The case where the athletes are too young to be fully autonomous is different for two important reasons .<-->O
Firstly , children are much less capable of rejecting training methods and treatments that their coach wishes to use .<-->O
Secondly , we think it is worth protecting the range of future options open to a child .<-->O
There is a serious ethical problem with allowing children to make any kind of choice that substantially closes off their options for future lifestyles and career choices .<-->O
If we do not consider children competent for the purposes of allowing them to make choices that cause them harm , then we should not allow them to decide to direct all of their time to professional gymnastics at age 10 .<-->O
The modifications such a choice can make to a child s upbringing are as serious , and potentially as harmful , as many of the available performance enhancing drugs .<-->O
Children who enter elite sport miss large parts of the education and socialisation that their peers receive , and are submitted to intense psychological pressure at an age when they are ill equipped to deal with it .<-->O
We argue that it is clear that children , who are not empowered to refuse harmful drugs , should not be given them by their coaches or parents .<-->O
But the same principles that make this point obvious should also make it obvious that these children should not be involved in elite competitive sport in the first place .<-->O
However , if children are allowed to train as professional athletes , then they should be allowed to take the same drugs , provided that they are no more dangerous than their training is .<-->N
Haugen s model showed that one of the biggest problems in fighting drug use was that the size of the rewards for winning could never be overshadowed by the penalties for being caught .<-->N
With this in mind , we can begin to protect children by banning them from professional sport .<-->N
CLIMATE OF CHEATING If we compare the medical harms of the entire worldwide doping problem , they would have to be much less than the worldwide harms stemming from civilian illicit drug use .<-->O
And yet , per drug user , the amount of money spent on combating drugs in sport outweighs the amount spent on combating civilian drug use by orders of magnitude .<-->N
We can fairly assume that if medical harms and adherence to law were the only reasons we felt compelled to eradicate doping , then the monetary value we placed on cleaning up sport should be the same , per drug user , as the monetary value we place on eradicating recreational drug use .<-->O
And yet it is not .<-->N
Because of this , it should be obvious that it is not medical harms that we think are primarily at stake , but harm to sport as a whole , a purported violation of its spirit .<-->O
It is a problem for the credibility of elite sport , if everyone is cheating .<-->N
If it is this climate of cheating that is our primary concern , then we should aim to draft sporting rules to which athletes are willing to adhere .<-->O
PROHIBITION It is one thing to argue that banning performance enhancing drugs has not been successful , or even that it will never be successful .<-->O
But it should also be noted that the prohibition of a substance that is already in demand carries its own intrinsic harms .<-->O
The Prohibition of Alcohol in America during the 1920s led to a change in drinking habits that actually increased consumption .<-->N
Driven from public bars , people began to drink at home , where the alcohol was more readily available , and the incidence of deaths due to alcoholism rose or remained stable , while they dropped widely around the world in countries without prohibition .38 Furthermore , as the quality of the alcohol was unregulated , the incidence of death from poisoned alcohol rose fourfold in five years .39 Even when prohibition leads to a decrease in consumption , it often leads to the creation of a black market to supply the continuing demand , as it did in the Greenland study of alcohol rationing .40 Black markets supply a product that is by definition unregulated , meaning that the use is unregulated and the safety of the product is questionable .<-->O
The direct risks from prohibiting performance enhancing drugs in sport are similar , but probably much more pronounced .<-->N
Athletes currently administer performance enhancing substances in doses that are commensurate with the amount of performance gain they wish to attain , rather than the dose that can be considered safe .<-->O
The athletic elite have near unlimited funds and the goal of near unlimited performance , a framework that results in the use of extremely unsafe doses .<-->O
If athletes are excluded when their bodies are unsafe for competition , this kind of direct consequence from prohibition would be reduced .<-->O
THE PROBLEM OF STRICT LIABILITY Lord Coe , a dual Olympic champion , has defended the doctrine of strict liability , as it is currently applied to athletes who use a banned substance :41 The rule of strict liability under which athletes have to be solely and legally responsible for what they consume must remain supreme .<-->O
We can not , without blinding reason and cause , move one millimetre from strict liability if we do , the battle to save sport is lost .<-->O
The best reason for adhering to this rule is that , if coaches were made responsible for drugs that they had given to their athletes , then the coach would be banned or fined , and the athlete could still win the event .<-->O
In this situation , other athletes would still be forced to take drugs in order to be competitive , even though the cheat had been caught .<-->O
But the doctrine of strict liability makes victims of athletes such as those of the East German swim team , who are competing in good faith but have been forced to take drugs .<-->O
It also seems dogmatically punitive for athletes like British skier Alain Baxter , who accidentally inhaled a banned stimulant when he used the American version of a Vicks decongestant inhaler , without realising that it differed from the British model .42 It seems that strict liability is unfair to athletes , but its absence is equally unfair .<-->O
Our proposal solves this paradox when we exclude athletes only on the basis of whether they are healthy enough to compete , the question of responsibility and liability becomes irrelevant .<-->O
Accidental or unwitting consumption of a risky drug is still risky ; the issue of good faith is irrelevant .<-->O
ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES Michael Ashenden43 proposes that we keep progressive logs of each athlete s PCV and hormone concentrations .<-->N
Significant deviations from the expected value would require follow up testing .<-->N
The Italian Cycling Federation decided in 2000 that all juniors would be tested to provide a baseline PCV and given a Hematologic Passport .<-->N
Although this strategy is in many ways preferable to the prohibition of doping , it does nothing to correct the dangers facing an athlete who has an unsafe baseline PCV or testosterone concentration .<-->O
TEST FOR HEALTH , NOT DRUGS The welfare of the athlete must be our primary concern .<-->O
If a drug does not expose an athlete to excessive risk , we should allow it even if it enhances performance .<-->O
We have two choices : to vainly try to turn the clock back , or to rethink who we are and what sport is , and to make a new 21st century Olympics .<-->O
Not a super-Olympics but a more human Olympics .<-->N
Our crusade against drugs in sport has failed .<-->N
Rather than fearing drugs in sport , we should embrace them .<-->N
In 1998 , the president of the International Olympic Committee , Juan-Antonio Samaranch , suggested that athletes be allowed to use non-harmful performance enhancing drugs .44 This view makes sense only if , by not using drugs , we are assured that athletes are not being harmed .<-->N
Performance enhancement is not against the spirit of sport ; it is the spirit of sport .<-->O
To choose to be better is to be human .<-->N
Athletes should be the given this choice .<-->N
Their welfare should be paramount .<-->O
But taking drugs is not necessarily cheating .<-->N
The legalisation of drugs in sport may be fairer and safer .<-->N
If Lance Armstrong is the biggest lie in sports , Lyle Alzado was its spawn .<-->N
It has been 20 years since the brain cancer wasted away and eventually killed the once-hulking former NFL lineman .<-->N
Steroids had been made a controlled substance by Congress a couple of years earlier , but the images of a gaunt Alzado and his assertions that steroid use had led to his illness did more to demonize steroids than any law could .<-->O
You see all these reports that steroids cause heart disease , cancer , strokes and so on , said Dr. Norman Fost , a professor of bioethics at the University of Wisconsin .<-->O
Then it gets repeated over and over again .<-->N
There is not a single study out there that proves steroids cause any of these diseases .<-->N
A decade after Alzado s death , the steroid fervor hit its crescendo with the raids on Bay Area Lab Co-Operative -LRB- BALCO -RRB- .<-->N
Dozens of athletes including baseball s all-time home run champ Barry Bonds and elite sprinter Marion Jones were alleged to have received banned substances .<-->O
The term performance-enhancing drugs -LRB- PEDs -RRB- was instantly part of the American lexicon , although not many questioned why these were banned and what the result of the media attention would bring .<-->N
It could have done more harm than good .<-->O
I think the increased attention of steroid use in sports has resulted in a larger number of people using steroids , said Millard Baker , who runs a website that advocates the medical and non-medical use of steroids .<-->N
In the 90s , people were na ve .<-->N
Now , it s in the news every single day .<-->N
That s given people a cheat sheet on how to improve performance even if that s for a basketball game on the weekends .<-->O
Fost and Baker are certainly in the minority , but the topic of PEDs doesn t grab the public s attention as it once did .<-->N
Blame the never-ending string of drug scandals , which continued in recent weeks as two Major League Baseball players San Francisco Giants outfielder Melky Cabrera and Oakland A s pitcher Bartolo Colon received 50-game suspensions after testing positive for synthetic testosterone .<-->N
Then , last Thursday , Armstrong , a seven-time Tour de France winner , announced he would give up his challenges to an investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency -LRB- USADA -RRB- .<-->N
USADA has banned Armstrong for life and has moved to strip him of all those Tour titles .<-->N
But maybe for the first time in the steroid era , the sanctions are moot .<-->N
Armstrong is retired and while race promoters could go after him for some of his winnings , none of his major sponsors a list that includes Nike , Oakley and Anheuser-Busch have left him .<-->N
Neither apparently have donors to his Livestrong cancer charity .<-->O
On the day after Armstrong gave up his fight against USADA , he tweeted that donations were up 25 percent from the day before .<-->N
Armstrong doesn t have to worry about gaining entry into a hall of fame like the federal government s two other major targets , Bonds and seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens .<-->O
-LRB- Federal prosecutors dropped their investigation of Armstrong earlier this year . -RRB-<-->N
Bonds was convicted on a single count of obstruction last year and was sentenced to a month of home confinement -LRB- a decision he s appealing -RRB- and Clemens was acquitted on perjury and obstruction charges in June .<-->O
It should be justice for one , justice for all , BALCO founder Victor Conte told FOXSports.com .<-->O
All these athletes aren t held to the same standard .<-->N
That s the problem I ve had with these investigations .<-->N
Clearly , it s selective prosecution .<-->N
There were probably 10 players involved with BALCO where the feds had similar evidence , but they targeted Barry Bonds .<-->N
In zoning in on Armstrong , USADA allegedly cut deals with other riders guilty of doping for information .<-->N
The result : Armstrong likely will have to give up his Tour titles to another rider who also might have doped in a sport that especially a decade ago was as drug-tinged as any in history .<-->O
Lance Armstrong was as clean as any other rider , said Charles Yesalis , a former professor at Penn State .<-->N
That s what s so hypocritical about the whole thing .<-->N
One might argue that he s just being picked on .<-->O
USADA CEO Travis Tygart sees the sanctions against Armstrong has a victory for clean athletes .<-->O
Anti-doping efforts have been worth it , and we hear that all the time , he told FOXSports.com .<-->N
Today s clean athletes don t have to quit the sport they love and have the dreams crushed or use dangerous performance-enhancing drugs to cheat and stay competitive .<-->O
Yesalis countered there is only one way to level the playing field in sports , especially since evading positive tests is commonplace .<-->O
Armstrong never tested positive in his career , nor did Bonds or Clemens .<-->N
Only one athlete out of more than 6,000 tests at the 2012 Olympics Belarusian shot putter Nadzeya Ostapchuk was flagged for an anabolic substance even as anti-doping officials admit the rate of use of such drugs is exponentially higher .<-->O
Get rid of drug testing , Yesalis said .<-->N
Do you really think we had a clean Olympics ?<-->O
All testing does is to continue to perpetuate the myth that sports are clean .<-->N
That s not a prospect that American swimmer Kicker Vencill , once caught up in the anti-doping net through no fault of his own , would like to see .<-->O
Vencill missed his shot at the 2004 Olympics when he received a two-year ban after taking a tainted vitamin supplement .<-->N
He sued the manufacturer and won a judgment because of the contamination in 2005 .<-->N
I don t think there are many athletes or even the public would want to see what that -LRB- ending drug testing -RRB- would do , Vencill said .<-->O
No matter where you are or what s going on in your life , sports have a way of bringing out the kid in all of us .<-->N
I think not testing would really change people s perspective .<-->O
Fost said legalization of PEDs would allow those substances to be effectively prescribed by physicians and adequate studies to be conducted on such drugs , something that is all but impossible under current federal regulations .<-->O
Legalization would also allow the drugs to be manufactured in FDA-regulated facilities , so athletes could be more confident about dosing , purity , contamination and other safety issues , Fost said .<-->O
The present system drives them to obtain drugs from manufacturers who have no oversight , increasing the risk of harm .<-->O
Vencill fears that some athletes would take use of PEDs to an extreme in that environment You are not only protecting the integrity of the game -LRB- with testing -RRB- , but you are also protecting the athletes from themselves , he said .<-->O
Some athletes , I m sure , would probably take matters into their own hands and things could get out of control .<-->O
Still , Fost contends that chemically enhancing your body shouldn t be seen any differently than other evolutions in the sporting landscape .<-->N
Athletes can sleep in -LRB- elevation-mimicking -RRB- hypoxic chambers , vaulters use fiberglass poles and riders can use the fastest bikes , Fost said .<-->N
Why shouldn t athletes be able to take advantage of the latest -LRB- doping -RRB- technology ?<-->N
People have been doing it since the beginning of time .<-->N
Fans aren t turned off by it .<-->N
It s quite the opposite , really .<-->O
Barry Bonds was one of the biggest draws in sports , and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa brought the fans out in droves during their home run chase .<-->N
People want to see bigger , stronger , faster athletes hit home runs and Olympic records being set .<-->N
Don Hooton , whose son Taylor committed suicide at age 17 after abruptly halting a cycle of steroids , hopes that day never comes to pass .<-->N
He runs the Taylor Hooton Foundation , which is slated to educate 250,000 high school students about the ills of steroid use this year alone .<-->N
The organization s website lists some of the alleged ills of steroid abuse , including mood swings -LRB- roid rage -RRB- , hallucinations and gynocomastia -LRB- male breast development -RRB- .<-->O
Few of those side effects have been proven by science , but Dr. Gary Wadler , a longtime medical advisor of the foundation , said the body can be seriously damaged by steroid use , especially the heart .<-->O
To study the use of steroids at the levels athletes currently use them is not going to happen , said Wadler , a New York internist who is a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency 's -LRB- WADA -RRB- prohibited list and methods subcommittee .<-->N
We don t allow people to take things that will hurt themselves -LRB- in studies -RRB- .<-->O
We can t tell athletes to take doping doses of steroids over a long period of time just to see how many get sick and die .<-->O
No institutional review board would allow that study to take place .<-->N
Therapeutic use of testosterone has been shown to be safe .<-->N
A 1996 paper on use of synthetic testosterone published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed notable gains in strength with no major side effects other than a handful of cases of breast tenderness and increased acne among the 40 men ages 19-40 who completed the study.Wadler says doping athletes are using much higher doses than those in that study .<-->O
And steroid use among teens is thought to be much more hazardous .<-->O
We have talked with enough other families who have been through what we ve been through to know this is a problem , Hooton said .<-->O
I ve had kids come up to me after one of our presentations and tell me , Mr. Hooton , I m sorry for what happened to Taylor , but , between you and me , I know how Taylor felt .<-->O
I did steroids and when I quit , I felt like he did .<-->O
The only thing is that I didn t commit suicide .<-->N
And Fost , a pediatrician , is by no means advocating PED use by juveniles .<-->N
There are some risks for children that are n't relevant for adults particularly stunting of growth and children are generally less capable of making informed choices than adults , Fost said .<-->O
I am in favor of testing programs in middle schools and high schools , not to punish the children , but to identify the sellers with harsh penalties for them .<-->O
Fost adds that the message that legalization of PEDs would send to children is no different than the one sent by two regulated vices : alcohol and tobacco .<-->N
The difference is that smoking kills 400,000 people a year , almost all of whom become addicted in adolescence , and drinking kills tens of thousands , many of them children , Fost said .<-->N
Deaths attributable to steroids are extraordinarily rare .<-->N
Hooton said despite the added awareness created by his group , Congressional inquiries and federal investigations , more teens are doing steroids now than ever before .<-->O
The feedback we re getting from kids is that the problem has not diminished , he said .<-->N
It s as wide open as it ever was .<-->N
It s certainly no longer a shock to hear an athlete get linked to performance-enhancing drugs .<-->O
It can cost an athlete millions , at least those not named Armstrong .<-->N
-LRB- Armstrong continues to deny he doped , even if he gave up his fight . -RRB-<-->O
But the use of PEDs , as testing statistics show , remains largely a consequence-free environment .<-->N
Maybe acceptance is the 12th step of the steroid era .<-->N
This could be the tipping point , Baker said of Armstrong .<-->N
He s a person so many people like due to his charitable work .<-->O
He s admired as a person , not just an athlete .<-->N
People see this and realize that nothing was accomplished by all these doping investigations .<-->N
It s just been one major witch hunt and a waste of taxpayer money .<-->O
Should performance-enhancing drugs be legalized ?<-->N
Our experts debate .<-->N
YES In theory , banning doping prevents athletes from taking unfair shortcuts and keeps sports on a level playing field .<-->N
In reality , these bans have done less to protect fairness and punish rule-breakers and more to discourage athletes from reaching the highest levels of success .<-->O
Lance Armstrong , the face of doping to many , is an example of the flawed logic behind bans .<-->N
Yes , Armstrong had an advantage because of his illegal activities .<-->N
But is it really an unfair advantage if the majority of your competitors are also using performance enhancing drugs -LRB- PEDs -RRB- ?<-->O
According to Business Insider , 20 out of 21 top three Tour de France finishers from 1999 to 2005 were taking PEDs , and 36 of 45 top three finishers from 1996 to 2010 were also doping .<-->N
While everybody s doing it might not fly in a kindergarten classroom , sports can and should have an internal standard of behavior .<-->O
The current bans simply don t work , and keep rule-following athletes from being competitve with their peers .<-->N
Sports are constantly evolving .<-->F
Walter Payton wasn t training with world-class coaches in state-of-the-art facilities when he dominated .<-->N
Babe Ruth wasn t drinking Gatorade or using creatine when he amazed his fans .<-->N
We don t ban the advantages that modern day athletes have over their predecessors , and that attitude of progress should apply across the board .<-->O
Getting a better night s sleep can enhance performance .<-->O
Eating a healthy breakfast , taking vitamins and supplements , training harder or simple genetic advantages there are countless factors that contribute to sports being unfair .<-->O
But that s the whole point of competition .<-->N
How many people would have cared about the Tour de France without Armstrong s stunning feats ?<-->N
Before failing a drug test in 2006 , Shawne Merriman was in highlight reel upon highlight reel during his 2005 season as the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year .<-->O
Who can deny the excitement of 1998 s record-breaking MLB home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa ?<-->O
Recently busted Alex Rodriguez is a career .300 hitter with 647 career homeruns , a 14 time all-star , a 3 time AL MVP and a World Series Champion .<-->N
We can continue the trend of hand-wringing and hysteria , with one doping scandal after another , further embarrassing the field of professional athletics or we can legalize and regulate performance-enhancing drugs to the benefit of sports and sports fans alike .<-->O
Let s do ourselves and our athletes a service by allowing them to perform at their best .<-->N

Why , then , do we get our knickers in a twist when professional athletes think Lance Armstrong or A-Rod turn out to have achieved their great feats with a boost from performance-enhancing drugs and other banned technologies ?<-->O
Not everyone turns up their nose when a high-profile athlete dopes .<-->N
Some offer excuses : the pressure to perform is overwhelming , and the rewards are too tempting to resist .<-->O
We allow special diets , scientifically optimized training , and novel equipment , so why ban drugs , or , in Lance s case , bags of whole blood ?<-->O
Aren t they all just technologies intended to produce outstanding performances ?<-->O
In some sports in some eras , nearly every competitor was doping : how else could an athlete have a shot at winning ?<-->N
That last argument everyone does it , so I m just leveling the pharmaceutical playing field provides half of the answer .<-->O
When I first asked elite athletes more than 30 years ago why drugs were being used , the answer was unequivocal : Whatever reservations you might have , no one wants to give up a competitive advantage , especially to someone who might not be as talented or dedicated as you but can get enough of an edge from drugs to beat you .<-->O
That story of a drug race spiraling ever upwards , much as the arms race drove nations to build more and deadlier weapons , is one of the best reasons to ban doping in sports .<-->N
It doesn t end with the pros either .<-->N
Amateur athletes , including high school and perhaps younger participants , look to their heroes for examples of how to succeed in sport .<-->O
If doping was allowed , we could expect non-elite athletes to pursue the latest advances in performance enhancing drugs just as they buy the latest running shoes , bikes , or tennis rackets .<-->O
In no universe is this a healthy development .<-->N
Pros and those who emulate them will be driven to use drugs in doses and combinations no scientist has ever studied .<-->N
Doping in pro sports is a useful prod that forces us to ask what sport is all about anyway ?<-->O
Why do we play ?<-->N
When we see an exceptional performance , when we experience one of those moments of grace and excellence in ourselves , what makes it so special ?<-->O
If excellence in sport is the intersection of talent and dedication , as I believe , then drugs distort and distract .<-->O
eOur shared understanding of the meaning and value of sport will determine whether doping should continue to be banned .<-->O
That decision is up to all of us .<-->N
The Use of Performance-Enhancing Drugs in Sports Michael Scott In the last couple of years , many athletes in different sports have been caught using performance-enhancing drugs .<-->N
When an athlete tests positive for performance-enhancing drugs , the athlete is usually well known .<-->N
Also , there have been many instances never reported .<-->N
It has come to a point where when an athlete is doing really well in his sport , speculations on the use of steroids or other performing-enhancing drugs arise .<-->O
But the bothersome thing about sports today is that the speculations may very well be true .<-->O
The use of steroids , and other performance-enhancing drugs , is dangerous .<-->N
Although it has enhanced the entertainment value of sports , it also has diminished the value of sportsmanship .<-->O
The use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports is widespread , becoming a matter of public knowledge and debate .<-->O
It has gotten to the point where athletes from other countries are coming to the United States to buy performance-enhancing drugs that are illegal in their home countries .<-->N
In his article `` Performance-Enhancing Substances Raise Serious Ethical Questions for Athletes , '' Kirk Johnson states that as a result of publicity , sales of performance-enhancing products have increased and companies are swiftly creating new products .<-->N
According to Johnson , `` Met-Rx ... said that it was developing a gum that boosted testosterone ... while you chew .<-->F
Another company has developed a steroid that dissolves under the tongue .<-->N
Advertising copy on the Internet bursts with claims about everything from better state of mind to heightened sexual performance '' -LRB- para .<-->O
18 -RRB- .<-->N
Athletes are also using dietary supplements that are advertised as having the same effects as prescription-only performance-enhancing drugs .<-->F
Studies indicate that some supplements change into illegal steroids once they 're taken into the body .<-->N
In `` Performance-Enhancing Dietary Supplements Are Dangerous , '' Gwen Knapp says , `` supplement use has been linked to the deaths of several athletes , who exceeded the recommended dosages or mixed their intake of supplements with other medications '' -LRB- para .<-->N
1 -RRB- .<-->N
She states that supplements are easy to buy , and athletes are drawn to them as if they were Michael Jordan 's latest shoe .<-->N
At first , a chain of vitamin stores did n't want to stock androstenedione , but when Mark McGwire admitted to using it during his record-breaking season , it became the must have ingredient .<-->O
Knapp believes that the problem with supplements is that they are almost unregulated .<-->N
The risky side effects of performance-enhancing drugs should be publicized .<-->N
Steven Ungerleider asserts in his article `` Steroids are Dangerous '' that even though steroid use may increase an athlete 's endurance and muscle growth , it also has many risky side effects .<-->O
Anabolic steroids are made in many forms that can be taken orally , injected , or rubbed into the skin .<-->N
In `` Steroids Are Harmful , '' Doug West states that steroids have many serious physical and psychological consequences .<-->N
They can cause cancer and strokes , stunt bone growth , and lead to aggression -LRB- para .<-->O
1 -RRB- .<-->N
They also may induce a sense of invincibility and promote excessively macho behavior , and sometimes , attacks of rage or psychosis -LRB- Ungerleider para .<-->O
12 -RRB- .<-->N
Men may also experience reduced sperm count , shrunken testicles , inability to achieve an erection , and irreversible breast enlargement .<-->O
Women may develop deep voices and excessive body hair .<-->N
According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse , the more serious life-threatening effects of steroid abuse are heart attacks , strokes , and liver cancer -LRB- West para .<-->O
7 -RRB- .<-->N
As far as the psychological toll , depression and addiction are other potential problems .<-->O
Other problems include irritability , impaired judgment , delusions and paranoid jealousy -LRB- para .<-->O
8 -RRB- .<-->N
Also , injecting steroids with contaminated needles creates a risk of HIV and other blood-borne infections -LRB- Ungerleider para .<-->F
13 -RRB- .<-->F
Why are athletes today , more athletic than athletes in the past ?<-->F
Some people say it 's because a lot of athletes are using performance-enhancing drugs .<-->N
In `` Athletes Will Never Stop Using Performance-Enhancing Drugs , '' Matt Barnard states that people should recognize that even the best athletes go to great lengths in order to succeed .<-->O
Definitely , one great length is the use of performance-enhancing drugs .<-->N
Some athletes struggle to achieve and keep up with better competition .<-->O
Though they condemn the use of drugs , international athletic associations and their corporate sponsors , covertly encourage drug use by demanding higher standards of achievement from athletes in order to reach fans and gain profit -LRB- Barnard para .<-->O
1 -RRB- .<-->N
However , Steve Olivier openly discourages the use of drugs .<-->N
He states in his article `` Banning Performance-Enhancing Drugs is Justified '' that athletes should be prohibited from taking performance-enhancing substances because these substances can harm those who use them .<-->N
According to Olivier , `` the use of performance-enhancing substances is not only illegal , it is also morally reprehensible in that it violates the virtues of honesty and trustworthiness , which go to the heart of the fairness and integrity of competitive sport '' -LRB- para .<-->O
4 -RRB- .<-->N
It also can be harmful to others .<-->N
The use of performing-enhancing drugs by role models can be an influence on young athletes .<-->N
If a young athlete , who is easily influenced , sees his hero attaining success through the use of performance-enhancing drugs , he 's going to perceive that as the only way to attain success .<-->O
The college level has been pretty successful at preventing the use of drugs .<-->N
In `` Testing for Steroids Has Been Effective at the College Level , '' Jack L. Copeland asserts that the drug testing program set up by the National Collegiate Athletic Association -LRB- NCAA -RRB- has helped reduce steroid use by college athletes .<-->N
Since athletes know they will be tested , most avoid steroid use .<-->O
The NCAA works with a laboratory that does an excellent job of identifying new performance-enhancing drugs and the substances that are taken to mask them .<-->N
Also , the NCAA spends a lot of money on educational efforts that inform college athletes about banned drugs -LRB- para .<-->N
1 -RRB- .<-->N
The NCAA 's drug-testing effort not only seeks to limit the use of performance-enhancing drugs , but also the use of `` street drugs . ''<-->F
Positive tests for banned substances have only been around one percent for several years now -LRB- para .<-->F
16 -RRB- .<-->N
It was a bold move into unmarked territory when the NCAA membership approved the NCAA 's drug-testing program in 1986 .<-->N
Now , doubts about the program 's ability to effectively discourage drug abuse have been satisfied .<-->O
Mary Wilbert , NCAA program coordinator in health and safety , says , `` The program does give support to those who do n't want to use substances , and lets them feel they do n't have to use them '' -LRB- qtd in Copeland para .<-->O
66 -RRB- .<-->N
It is now thought that there should be a focus on drugs on the high school and lower levels .<-->O
Greg Schwab recognizes in `` Steroid Use Among High School Athletes is a Growing Problem '' that the use of dietary supplements and performance-enhancing drugs among high school athletes is increasing tremendously .<-->O
According to a survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse , 2.7 percent of eighth - and tenth-graders and 2.9 percent of twelfth-graders admitted they had taken steroids at least once -LRB- Ungerleider para .<-->N
6 -RRB- .<-->N
Recent studies have shown that the use of steroids among high school athletes has increased as much as sixty percent .<-->N
West believes many young adults are using steroids to comply with cultural standards of manliness , to achieve the perfect body , or to boost athletic performance .<-->O
The values taught by participation in a team or individual sport , the values of competition , teamwork , dedication , and cooperation , have been replaced by the value of excelling at the highest level .<-->O
High school athletes are willing to do a lot in order to excel .<-->O
According to Schwab , high school athletes use all sports supplements as part of their training regimen , and the supplements are too easy to get .<-->O
`` While I am no expert on this , I have always believed that dietary supplements can lead athletes to using performance-enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids '' -LRB- Schwab para .<-->N
2 -RRB- .<-->N
Also , professional athletes are huge influences .<-->N
When a professional athlete admits to using steroids , some young athletes might think that it is part of what one must do to become an elite athlete .<-->O
Schwab asserts that the use of steroids and supplements among high school athletes is a problem that needs to be addressed .<-->O
In order to prevent the youth from going down the dead-end trail , it is the responsibility of the `` parents , youth workers and educators ... to exert a more positive long-lasting influence on our kids by investing our time and ourselves in loving them for who they are while shattering the false images our culture convincingly sells regarding who they must be '' -LRB- West para .<-->O
11 -RRB- .<-->N
Some people believe that steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs do n't harm .<-->O
In `` Performance-Enhancing Dietary Supplements Are Safe , '' the Council for Responsible Nutrition -LRB- CRN -RRB- states that within recommended dosage limits , performance-enhancing drugs , such as creatine and ephedra , are safe .<-->O
People seek an `` edge '' to support and improve performance , and millions of people have found that sports supplements are one helpful tool .<-->O
But performance-enhancing products should n't be promoted to children .<-->N
Creatine is considered safe for healthy people , but it should n't be used by people with kidney problems -LRB- Council para .<-->O
2 -RRB- .<-->N
According to studies by Columbia and Harvard , and a safety evaluation by Cantox , ephedra can be used safely .<-->N
The CRN asserts that `` media assertions that supplements are unregulated as a result of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act are false The Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate supplements in the same way that it regulates any other food product '' -LRB- para .<-->O
1 -RRB- .<-->N
According to Dr. Annette Dickinson , the CRN 's vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs , `` The truth is that dietary supplements are used by more than half of Americans , are beneficial in a variety of ways , and have a safety record comparable to that of any other food category '' -LRB- qtd .<-->O
in CRN , para .<-->N
7 -RRB- .<-->F
Today , it seems as if fans are starting to accept performance-enhancing drugs in sports .<-->N
Barnard believes we will certainly accept drugs in sport , just as we accept them in medicine , cosmetics or farming .<-->O
In 1998 , Mark McGwire hit the most home runs in a single season , breaking what is considered the most prestigious sports record in America .<-->O
He later admitted to using a performance-enhancing drug , androstenedione , during his record-breaking season .<-->N
But instead of dooming baseball , he was credited with `` reviving interest in America 's first game , giving it a renewed sense of value after the player strikes of 1994 '' -LRB- Barnard para .<-->O
3 -RRB- .<-->N
Today , sports are fine without supernatural athletes ; they have been for centuries .<-->N
Sports are probably as popular as ever , providing entertainment to millions of fans all over the world .<-->N
But the use of performance-enhancing drugs is violating the moral principles that govern sports .<-->N
Athletes are admired for their skills and ability , but it should be their natural athleticism that gets them recognized .<-->O
Athletes should practice and play as hard as they can in working to be successful .<-->O
In its article , `` Performance-Enhancing Drugs Tarnish Athletics , '' the European Commission asserts the belief that the use of performance-enhancing drugs `` is at odds with the principle that athletes should work without artificial resources to achieve success '' -LRB- para .<-->O
1 -RRB- .<-->N
Some athletes should just ask themselves one question : Do we really want to harm our bodies and tarnish the image of sports in order to be successful ?<-->O
Should We Accept Steroid Use in Sports?The debate over athletes ' use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs has taken on newfound urgency in recent months .<-->O
A report by former Sen. George Mitchell , released in December , mentioned dozens of baseball players as having used steroids and described their use as `` widespread . ''<-->N
Track star Marion Jones pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about steroid use in October .<-->O
And last summer , several riders were dismissed from the Tour de France on charges of using banned substances .<-->N
Those who oppose the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs say that the athletes who use them are breaking the rules and getting an unfair advantage over others .<-->O
Opponents of the drugs say the athletes are endangering not only their own health , but also indirectly encouraging youngsters to do the same .<-->N
Others maintain that it is hypocritical for society to encourage consumers to seek drugs to treat all sorts of ailments and conditions but to disdain drug use for sports .<-->O
They say the risk to athletes has been overstated and that the effort to keep them from using performance-enhancing drugs is bound to fail .<-->N
Six experts on steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs recently took on the issue in an Oxford-style debate , part of the series Intelligence Squared U.S. .<-->N
The debates are modeled on a program begun in London in 2002 : Three experts argue in favor of a proposition and three argue against .<-->O
In the latest debate , held on Jan. 15 , the formal proposition was , `` We should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports . ''<-->O
As the debate began , it was announced that former Olympics sprinter Ben Johnson , who was scheduled to argue in favor of allowing drugs , had pulled out on the advice of his lawyer because of his involvement in a lawsuit .<-->O
Johnson was stripped of his gold medal in the 1988 Olympics after testing positive for steroids .<-->N
In a vote before the debate , 18 percent of audience members supported the motion to accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports , and 63 percent opposed it .<-->O
Nineteen percent were undecided .<-->N
After the debate , 37 percent of audience members agreed with the proposition .<-->N
Fifty-nine percent opposed it , and 4 percent remained undecided .<-->N
Permit Doping So We Can Monitor ItThe war on drugs in sports is failing and must inevitably fail .<-->O
Paradoxically , the zero-tolerance approach to doping is ruining sports .<-->N
We should allow drugs in competitive sports for three reasons .<-->O
First , the ban is ruining the mood and spirit of the game .<-->N
It s hard to enjoy any sports narrative if we don t know who is clean and who isn t. Second , the ban is actually bad for the health of the athletes .<-->O
They currently use undetectable substances and methods with no medical supervision or responsibility .<-->N
How can this be monitored ?<-->N
Third , the ban is unfair .<-->N
Honest athletes don t have access to safe enhancement methods .<-->N
Cheaters have the competitive advantage .<-->N
Throughout human history , athletes have tried to use various substances to improve their performance .<-->N
Some doping agents have been permitted like caffeine , which increases time to exhaustion by 10 percent .<-->N
But this wasn t always the case .<-->N
Athletes used to get stripped of their medals when they tested positive for it .<-->N
It is legal today because it is safe enough .<-->N
As evidenced by the lifting of the caffeine ban in 2004 , we should relax the drug ban even more , allowing for performance enhancers in adults -LRB- not children -RRB- if the drugs satisfy three criteria : 1 .<-->O
They should be safe enough .<-->O
Safety should be judged relative to the risks of the sport , which are considerable .<-->N
American football can cause quadriplegia .<-->N
Medical supervised administration of steroids poses nothing like that kind of risk .<-->O
The drugs taken should be consistent with the spirit of the sport in question .<-->O
Steroids do not add some magical ability ; they simply enhance the effects of hard training and accelerate recovery from injury .<-->O
However , beta-blockers to reduce tremors would compromise sports that test the athlete s nerve , like archery and shooting .<-->O
The intervention should not dominate or dehumanize performance .<-->O
Robotic limbs would substantially remove the human element to running .<-->N
But steroids , growth hormone and blood doping mimic natural processes .<-->N
We have the science to enhance athletic performance safely .<-->N
We should use it .<-->N
Do you believe in individual freedom ?<-->N
If so , the use of drugs should be up to each individual .<-->N
The government 's role is to educate and to provide regulations which assure that the drugs you get are what you expect .<-->N
Marijuana should be legal and certainly should not be on any athletes ' banned substances list .<-->O
It is simply not a performance enhancing drug .<-->N
Drugs that are clearly dangerous -LRB- Methamphetamine for instance -RRB- should be available through a doctor .<-->O
People who participate in professional sports that generate huge incomes will continue to use performance enhancing drugs as long as it pays .<-->O
You ca n't prevent it and you ca n't test for it -LRB- Lance Armstrong -RRB- .<-->N
Many people object to drug use on moral grounds .<-->O
Drugs are neither good nor bad .<-->N
Morals are only in the minds of people and are often arbitrary .<-->N
Marijuana prohibition is the best example of morals based drug laws .<-->N
Drug use is a medical issue .<-->N
People who consume too much alcohol need rehabilitation and counseling .<-->O
It makes no sense to put any drug user in jail for using drugs .<-->N
Nearly everyone is a drug user .<-->N
If you take too much Oxycontin should you go to jail ?<-->O
You should n't go to jail because it 's expensive and wo n't help you get well .<-->O
Athletes do n't pay for their drugs , the teams supply them .<-->N
Teams would be able to give more support , and athletes would be more willing to accept that support to the use of drugs if they did n't have to hide it .<-->O
Athletes get picked by teams at young ages , before they start using drugs .<-->N
So they still get picked for their talent .<-->N
Mind you , drug enhancements of any kind are still forbidden for young athletes .<-->O
Currently , once athletes are picked to be pros they get thrown into this mad world of hide and seek and they ca n't really turn back or stay clean if they wish to do well .<-->O
Teams would have no real incentive to throw away talent they can enhance , even with that 1-strike-out rule .<-->O
You seem to assume that doping is something athletes do on their own and that teams have no hand in it .<-->N
That 's just naive .<-->O
`` You can not allow PED 's in team sports without severely affecting the livelihoods of every player in the sport , whether they use or not . ''<-->O
This is already what 's happening .<-->N
There are already rules that say you ca n't use PED 's ; clearly they 're not working .<-->N
The idea is to make it safer for the athletes.I am curious what others think of the marijuana ban .<-->O
Is it banned because it is a controlled substance in some countries , and it is a controlled substance because of the apparent ... health risks ?<-->N
Many athletes use marijuana as a pain reliever , and some say it is a performance enhancer - helps them focus and relax .<-->O
It is not addictive in the same way as alcohol and other substances , and side effects on health are not proven to be any more damaging than alcohol use .<-->N
The claim that marijuana is unhealthy seems absurd when world class athletes are regularly caught using it so close to a performance .<-->O
So why is it tested for?And lastly , the use of these substances is DRAMATIC .<-->N
As a former athlete , and one who has relatives coaching in MMA , it is impossible to compete against those who are using .<-->N
It changes them , their chemistry , makes them into something they were never intended to be .<-->N
So they do more than `` simply enhance the effects of hard training and accelerate recovery from injury . ''<-->O
Do we really want sports to become all about who has the best chemist ?<-->O
If so , sports become a battle of chemists and chemicals and not so much the intrinsic qualities -LRB- heart , discipline , perseverance , commitment , sacrifice , etc -RRB- that an athlete brings to the table .<-->O
The things most find intriguing and interesting about sports .<-->O
Continuing down the path we are discussing , legalizing all PED 's , would change sports as we know it .<-->O
We would lose the intrinsic values that can be gained through a positive sports experience as `` winning at any cost '' would truly become dominate .<-->O
What is ruining the mood in sports is the `` winning at all -LSB- any -RSB- costs '' attitudes that are becoming more and more prevalent , and certainly trickling down to the lower levels of sport .<-->O
If we do as you suggest and it only becomes worse not better .<-->O
Saying `` they currently use undetectable substances and methods with no medical supervision or responsibility '' as justification that we should then legalize and monitor it is like saying that because high school and junior high school age kids are drinking alcohol on the weekends we should just lower the drinking age to say11 or 12 and monitor it .<-->O
And before you say that some countries do allow this , I must point out -LRB- at least to my knowledge -RRB- that these same countries have just as much difficulty with alcohol related issues and alcoholism as we do .<-->O
Your second point is not a solution because it does not address the root of the problem .<-->N
The flip side to justification # 3 is that if we do legalize and monitor it as you say ALL would have to take these substances to compete at high levels .<-->O
The ramifications would extend well beyond the professional and elite levels of sport .<-->O
Along with that would be the support given that winning at any price is OK .<-->O
Not something I can ever subscribe to .<-->N
Let every young boy and girl watching the Olympics on TV thinking `` I 'm going to win a Gold medal in that sport someday '' -- that impossible , if not preposterous , idea where every Olympian 's journey to the medalist platform starts -- get the message that cheating and doping are OK during athletic competition and in the classroom , too , so long as you win .<-->O
Winning only matters .<-->N
Only losers do n't cheat .<-->N
The implicit message then becomes , `` We allow cheating because we 're powerless to stop it .<-->O
So we give up ! ''<-->N
; a fine declaration in its own right .<-->O
`` We quit !<-->N
We give up !<-->N
So it 's OK to cheat , make a mockery of the whole thing -- in athletic competition , on school assignments and tests .<-->O
It 's even OK to be at school stoned or wired , if it gets you an ` A ' '' .<-->N
Sports analysts and commentators will speculate -- or wax poetic , even -- about which cocktail of drugs might be responsible for some amazing performance or new world record instead of focusing on discipline , determination , skill and training , this chatter rattling in the background while children watch champions compete on TV , watch the culmination of someone elses ' Olympian dream , as their mindset forms .<-->O
Performance enhancing drugs in sport Why not allow drug use in sports ?<-->N
It isn t just drugs that are improving athlete s performances , sports technology , equipment and new training techniques are having an ever greater impact on the performances of athletes .<-->O
As this happens it is less and less the athletes natural ability and motivation which gives them the edge , and more their equipment and training budget .<-->O
Sports clothing such as body-hugging tops that can help players escape tackles in rugby and technologies such as streamlined , light weight racing bikes can give a team a winning margin .<-->O
Why then should these athletes be banned from using substances that can help them to get more out of their training and practice ?<-->N
Oxford Debates Performance enhancing drugs should be allowed in sport Proposer s opening statementTwo great sporting events are about to commence .<-->N
Le Tour de France and the Football World Cup .<-->N
Doping will play a part in both of these .<-->N
In every professional sport where doping could confer an advantage , there is doping .<-->O
Even if it is not widespread and even if you don t know about it .<-->O
This is most obvious in Le Tour .<-->N
Since it began in 1903 , riders have used drugs to cope with the ordeal , resorting to alcohol , caffeine , cocaine , amphetamines , steroids , growth hormone , EPO and blood doping .<-->N
But all sports , even the World Cup , face the drug problem .<-->N
The enormous rewards for the winner , the effectiveness of the drugs and the low rate of testing all create a cheating ` game ' that has proved irresistible to some athletes .<-->O
It is irresistible because of human nature .<-->N
And the cheating athletes are now winning .<-->N
Drugs such as EPO and growth hormone are natural chemicals in the body and are hard to detect .<-->O
And the task will get tougher still .<-->N
Athletes have returned to simple blood doping -LRB- having their own blood donated prior to competition and retransfused during the event -RRB- , which is virtually impossible to detect if done properly .<-->O
Gene doping , for example , will be equally difficult to detect .<-->N
This is a technique which allows the introduction of genes into an athlete 's own genetic material , or DNA , to improve muscular strength or endurance .<-->N
Also , the injection of an insulin-like growth factor -LRB- proven to increase muscle strength in mice -RRB- into the muscles of athletes would be simple .<-->O
Detection would require muscle biopsy , slicing a core of muscle to examine under a microscope , which would be dangerous and difficult .<-->O
EPO genes could also be directly integrated into athletes ' DNA .<-->N
Such gene therapy already works in monkeys .<-->F
There are only two options .<-->N
We can try to ratchet up the war on doping .<-->N
But this will fail , as the war on all victimless crimes involving personal advantage have failed -LRB- look at the war on alcohol , drugs and prostitution -RRB- .<-->O
Or we can regulate the use of performance-enhancing drugs .<-->N
Some performance enhancers which were once illegal , such as caffeine , have been legalised because they are safe enough .<-->O
This has had no adverse effects on sport and has removed the necessity of policing a ban and the problem of cheating .<-->N
Some controversy could have been avoided if we allowed riders to take EPO or blood dope up to some safe level , for example where their red blood cells make up 50 per cent of their blood .<-->O
This level is deemed safe by the International Cycling Union and this level is easily detected by a simple , reliable and cheap blood test .<-->O
Other drugs such as growth hormone can be monitored by evaluating athletes ' health , looking for signs of excess , rather than trying to detect what is a normal hormone .<-->O
A rational , realistic approach to doping would be to allow safe performance-enhancing drugs which are consistent with the spirit of a particular sport , and to focus on evaluating athletes ' health .<-->O
Some interventions would change the nature of a sport , like creating webbed hands and feet in swimming , and should be banned on those grounds .<-->O
But the use of drugs to increase endurance is a part of sport s history .<-->N
The rules of a sport are not God-given , but are primarily there for 4 reasons : -LRB- 1 -RRB- they define the nature of a particular display of physical excellence ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- create conditions for fair competition ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- protect health ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- provide a spectacle .<-->O
Any rule must be enforceable .<-->N
The current zero tolerance to drugs fails on the last three grounds and is unenforceable .<-->N
The rules can be changed .<-->N
We can better protect the health of competitors by allowing access to safe performance-enhancement and monitoring their health .<-->O
We provide a better spectacle if we give up the futile search for undetectable drugs , and focus on measurable issues relevant to the athlete 's health .<-->O
Given the pay-offs in terms of glory and money , some athletes will always access a black market of dangerous banned drugs which confer an extra advantage .<-->O
But overall , regulated access is better than prohibition , as the honest athletes presently have no access to performance-enhancers .<-->O
Under a regulated market , they would have access to some safe performance-enhancers .<-->N
This would narrow the advantage gap between the cheats and the honest athletes .<-->O
And we would create a stimulus for the market to produce new , safe performance - enhancers .<-->N
Limited resources could be better deployed to detect the dangerous drugs .<-->O
The World Anti-Doping Agency -LRB- WADA -RRB- claims that performance enhancement is against the spirit of sport .<-->O
But caffeine does not appear to have corrupted the Olympics .<-->N
Athletes already radically change their bodies through advanced , technologically-driven training regimes .<-->N
Tour riders receive intravenous artificial nutrition and hydration overnight because their bodies can not take on enough food and fluid naturally .<-->O
Ben Johnson , stripped of his 100 metres Olympic gold at the 1988 Games , said that the human body was not designed to run the speeds it is called upon to run now , and steroids were necessary to recover from the gruelling training and injuries .<-->O
Jacques Anquetil , the great French cyclist , once asked a French politician if `` they expect us to ride the Tour on mineral water '' .<-->N
Far from demonising these great athletes , we should admire them .<-->O
The use of drugs to accelerate recovery and to enhance the expression of human ability are a part of the spirit of sport .<-->O
Some drugs , such as the modest use of EPO or growth hormone , can enhance the expression of physical excellence in sport .<-->O
The challenge is to understand the spirit of each sport , and which drugs are consistent with this .<-->O
But performance-enhancement per se is not against the spirit of sport ; it is the spirit of sport .<-->O
To choose to be better is to be human .<-->N
What is ruining sport is cheating .<-->N
But cheating can be reduced by changing the rules .<-->N
Cheating can be better reduced by allowing drugs rather than banning them .<-->O
Ten years from now , 2007 will be remembered as the year in which the Tour de France died .<-->N
Race leader and likely eventual winner , Michael Rasmussen , was sacked a few stages from the end on an allegation of doping -LRB- without evidence -RRB- .<-->N
Pre-race favourite Vinokourov expelled after blood doping and his team Astana withdraw .<-->N
The Cofidis team withdraw from the Tour de France following the news that their Italian rider Cristian Moreni tested positive for testosterone .<-->N
Even the eventual winner had to fend off questions about the legality of his victory .<-->N
The winner s team , which once was home to the Tour legend Lance Armstrong , is disbanding because it can not secure sponsorship .<-->N
By all accounts , drug scandals have ripped the sport of professional cycling to shreds .<-->N
The Tour moved from being the greatest test of human endurance to a petty media-fest of allegations , recriminations and scandals , with the world s best athletes being expelled like shabby contestants in Big Brother .<-->O
For the competitors , doping is a part of the spirit of Le Tour .<-->N
Since it began in 1903 , riders have invariably used performance-enhancing substances in an attempt get through the gruelling 21 day test of human endurance .<-->N
They have taken alcohol , caffeine , cocaine , amphetamines , steroids , growth hormone , EPO and blood doping .<-->N
Fausto Coppi , who won the golden jersey in 1949 and 1952 , summed it up when he was asked whether he ever used amphetamines , or La Bomba , and replied , Only when absolutely necessary .<-->O
When asked how often that was , he said , Most of the time .<-->N
The 1967 Tour saw a rider collapse and die during the competition with amphetamines in his pocket .1 The Tour requires a superhuman effort .<-->F
Bjarne Riis , 1996 Tour winner , admitted taking EPO .2 The 1997 winner , Jan Ulrich , was later alleged to be taking drugs .<-->N
Floyd Landis , 2006 winner , was disqualified testing positive for testosterone .<-->N
The only recent winner of the Tour not to be found taking drugs is Lance Armstrong , but after winning his seventh Tour , he faced allegations that a frozen sample from his first tour victory had now been found to contain EPO .<-->O
Since the 1960s , the idealistic drug crusaders have been on a mission to reverse the course of history , and eliminate drugs from the sport .<-->N
But this zero tolerance strategy to drugs has failed , as this year s tour spectacularly shows .<-->O
And it is bound to fail .<-->N
Only around 10-15 % of professional athletes are drug tested .<-->N
There are enormous pressures to win .<-->N
And the development of new drugs is clearly outstripping our capacity to develop effective tests .<-->N
Many modern doping agents like EPO and growth hormone mimic natural hormones and are extremely difficult to detect .<-->O
If these agents are developed in secret , either by underground labs or by government-funded researchers , there is no way to detect them until samples are discovered by the authorities .<-->N
The Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative -LRB- BALCO -RRB- secretly developed the designer steroid THG , and marketed it to elite sportspeople like baseball legend Barry Bonds and athletics superstar Marion Jones .<-->N
The drug was a well-kept secret , and a test was only developed after a sample was anonymously mailed to the authorities by Jones coach , Trevor Graham .3 As gene doping becomes more efficient , it is likely to offer great opportunities for doping in sport and is likely to be very difficult to detect , whether samples are discovered or not .<-->O
For example , Insulin-like growth factor injected into the muscles of mice increases strength .<-->N
Direct injection into the muscles of athletes would be simple and very difficult to detect as DNA would be taken into muscle DNA , requiring muscle biopsy -LRB- which is dangerous and difficult -RRB- to detect it .<-->O
Vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates the development of new blood vessels and could also be of use to athletes in the future .<-->N
EPO genes could be directly integrated into host DNA .<-->N
Since such gene therapy works in animals , and there is no reason why it could not be attempted by athletes now .<-->O
Some people claim that these recent positive tests show we are winning the war on drugs .<-->O
All prohibitionist policies on alcohol , prostitution , recreational drugs - will fail because they involve victimless crimes and the financial incentives in these activities is so strong .<-->O
And there is no evidence that the current policy is picking up competent cheaters .<-->N
Riis was never detected he confessed .<-->N
Alexander Vinokourov was ejected from Le Tour this year for blood doping , causing his entire team to withdraw .<-->N
But it is alleged that he was only picked up because he was using someone else s blood .4 He would not have been caught if he had used his own blood .<-->O
Landis is alleged to have used testosterone to win a stage after an appalling performance the day before .<-->N
But testosterone takes weeks to increase a rider s muscle mass it does not confer any instantaneous performance enhancement .<-->N
If it is true that he was using testosterone , a much plausible explanation was that he donated some of his own blood months before , while training but on testosterone , and that testosterone remained in the blood that was given back during the Tour .<-->O
He was caught , in that case , because of incompetence .<-->N
It is likely that many riders in the Tour are doping in one way or another .<-->N
There are only two options .<-->N
We can vainly try to ratchet up our war on doping .<-->O
Or we can take a rational approach to the use of performance enhancers : allow drugs which are safe and do not corrupt the spirit of a sport , as a display of human physical excellence .<-->O
How would such a policy have helped the Tour ?<-->N
Le Tour , Blood Doping and EPO The ability to perform well in endurance sporting events is determined by the ability to deliver oxygen to muscles .<-->O
The more red blood cells you have , the more oxygen you can carry .<-->N
Erythropoietin -LRB- EPO -RRB- is a natural hormone that stimulates red blood cell production , raising the haematocrit -LRB- HCT -RRB- -- the percentage of the blood made up by red blood cells .<-->O
EPO is produced in response to anaemia , haemorrhage , pregnancy , or living at high altitude .<-->N
At sea level , the average person has an HCT of 40-50 percent .<-->N
HCT naturally varies 2.5 per cent of all men have a HCT above 50 percent .5 Raising the HCT too high can cause health problems .<-->O
Your risk of harm rapidly rises as HCT gets above 50 per cent , especially if you also have high blood pressure .6 When your HCT is over 56 per cent , you are at high risk of stroke , heart and lung failure .<-->O
In the four years after EPO became available in Europe , twenty cyclists died of sudden and unexpected cardiac problems .7 Use of EPO is endemic in cycling and many other sports .<-->N
EPO is extremely hard to detect and its use has continued despite sophisticated testing .<-->O
Athletes have also moved back to blood doping , where they donate a unit of their own blood months before and have it retransfused during the race , after their own levels have been replenished .<-->O
This increases the concentration of red blood cells in the body without leaving any chemical trace , and no physical trace other than , perhaps , a puncture mark , though riders are routinely on intravenous nutrition and hydraion because they can not eat or drink enough naturally to cope with the demans of today s Tour .<-->O
Partly due to the existence of undetectable blood doping , the International Cycling Union requires that athletes to have a HCT no higher than 50 per cent .<-->N
This criterion casts a net which ensnares those who use inject too much EPO , perform too much blood doping , and those who are born with a naturally elevated haematocrit .<-->O
Athletes with a naturally elevated level of HCT can not race unless doctors can prove their HCT is natural .<-->O
Charles Wegelius was a British rider who was banned and then cleared in 2003 .<-->N
He had had his spleen removed in 1998 following an accident -- since the spleen removes red blood cells , this increased his HCT .8 Finnish cross country skier Eoro Maentyranta won two Olympic gold medals in 1964 .<-->O
Subsequently , it was found he had a genetic mutation that meant that he `` naturally '' had 40-50 per cent more red blood cells than the average competitor .9 There are other ways to increase the number of red blood cells which are legal .<-->O
Altitude training can push the HCT to dangerous , even fatal , levels .<-->O
More recently , hypoxic air machines simulate altitude training .<-->N
The body responds by releasing natural EPO and growing more blood cells , so that the body may absorb more oxygen with every breath .<-->O
The results of a haematocrit test show no difference whether you elevating your blood count by altitude training , by using a hypoxic air machine , by having an elective splenectomy , or by taking EPO .<-->O
At present , the authorities use haematocrit tests to identify people who are cheating , and make special allowances for those who are born different , or who like Wegelius have become different through some medical procedure .<-->N
In practice , these tests are only capable of catching those who are incompetent at cheating , and even then there is only a small chance that each incompetent cheater will be caught .<-->O
The present situation is inherently unfair .<-->N
It is unfair to those riders who have not had their spleen removed .<-->N
It is unfair to those riders who cheated like all the others , but who were unlucky enough to be tested at the wrong time .<-->O
And it is unfair to those who can not afford hypoxic training facilities .<-->N
The current system rewards the competent cheaters .<-->N
A fairer , more effective option would be to forget about finding the cheaters , to forget about making special allowances , and simply measure every cyclist s haematocrit .<-->O
This would not catch many cheaters , but it would entirely solve the cheating problem .<-->O
The test is simple , cheap and reliable , and could be done at the beginning of a race .<-->O
We could pick a safe level for competition .<-->N
The International Cycling Union currently sets this at 50 % but we could revise that .<-->N
If that is the safe limit , we should let people dope to that limit .<-->O
Currently , it is illegal to use EPO or blood doping to move your haematocrit from 48 to 49 % -LRB- though it is legal to do it by using a hypoxic air machine or altitude training -RRB- even though some people will have a normal level of 49 % .<-->O
But if 50 % is the safe limit , anyone should be allowed to raise their red cell count to that level and all those above should be excluded for health reasons , even if it is natural -LRB- or these people s red cell count could be lowered to safe levels by diluting their blood -RRB- .<-->O
Athletes do not cheat when they take legal performance enhancers like caffeine or creatine .<-->O
Under blanket haematocrit limits , every blood-based performance enhancer would be like these legal drugs .<-->N
A similar strategy could be adopted for anabolic steroids .<-->N
While we test athletes for unsafe levels of HCT , we could test every athlete for the symptoms of dangerous steroid overuse .<-->O
This would mean regularly testing each athlete for liver damage , cholesterol , blood pressure and left-ventricle hypertrophy , which increases the risk of heart attack and sudden cardiac death .10 It makes no moral difference whether an athlete has liver damage or high cholesterol from steroids or from poor diet .<-->O
If their cholesterol level puts them at risk of death during intense athletic competition , they should be excluded for safety reasons .<-->O
Conversely , if their use of steroids has not produced symptoms of harm , they ought to be allowed to compete , regardless of whether or not they are clean .<-->O
A regulated permissive policy would paradoxically reduce risk to athletes .<-->O
The present system creates an environment of risk to the athlete .<-->N
Since nearly all doping is illegal , the pressure is to develop undetectable performance enhancers with no mind to safety .<-->O
Furthermore , the penalties are the same no matter what dosage an athlete takes , and no matter how effective the drug is , so athletes are forced to take massive doses of the most effective drugs .<-->O
Performance enhancers are produced on the black market and administered in a clandestine , uncontrolled way with no monitoring of the athlete s health .<-->O
Allowing the use of safe performance enhancers would make sport safer as there would be less pressure on athletes to take unsafe enhancers .<-->O
Blanket safety testing of every athlete would create a powerful incentive to limit the use of existing enhancements to safe doses .<-->O
If the safe doses were ineffective at producing a performance benefit , it would create a powerful pressure to develop new performance enhancers which are effective at a safe dose .<-->O
Allowing the safe use of performance enhancers would not eliminate risk to athletes health but it could reduce it to an arbitrarily low level .<-->O
If we make sure to test every athlete for medical indications of risk , it will become more difficult for cheaters to endanger their health by using unsafe dosages or toxic enhancements .<-->O
Such a system would be effective against most clandestine undetectable drugs .<-->O
Enhanced Recovery and Athlete Health Sporting bodies , pundits and players often talk about what s good for their sport .<-->N
Drugs are often said to be bad for a sport .<-->N
But this is an oversimplification .<-->N
Any change whether technological , regulatory or pharmaceutical can be good for players and bad for fans , or vice versa .<-->O
Whether a drug is good for the fans or for the players depends on what kind of drug it is .<-->N
Sometimes , a technology or method of training appears which is good for both the players and the spectators .<-->N
Ironically , the two best examples of such a win-win technology are the most infamous performance enhancements available anabolic steroids and EPO .<-->O
One of the effects of steroid use is that it aids players in recovering from injury and training .<-->N
Accelerated recovery is an artificial enhancement , but it is not the type of enhancement that makes anybody worse off .<-->O
To the contrary , when an athlete takes a long time to recover from injury , it is bad for everyone his fans , his teammates , and the athlete himself .<-->O
Players have often used steroids with this recuperative purpose in mind .<-->N
Ben Johnson said in a radio interview that the human body was not designed to run the speeds it is called upon to run now , and steroids were necessary to recover from the gruelling training and injuries .<-->N
The American baseball player Chad Fox said this in 2003 , in the midst of Major League Baseball s recent doping scandals : With all the injuries I 've had , I could have taken steroids .<-->O
But my family is too important .<-->N
-LRB- Bloom 2003 -RRB- 11 When he made this statement , Fox was referring to the period before testing began , so he could not have meant that his family would suffer if he was banned for doping .<-->O
He meant that his family would be put at grave risk by the side-effects steroids would have on his body .<-->O
But this reflects a gross exaggeration of the dangers of steroid use .<-->N
Doctors regularly prescribe anabolic steroids to civilians who are recovering from injuries or surgery .<-->N
Taken in clinical doses , anabolic steroids are extremely safe and effective at reducing recuperation time .12 In order to elicit both the muscle-building effects of steroids and its famous health-endangering side-effects , an athlete must take very large quantities of the drug .<-->O
In other words , if Fox had taken the steroids in modest doses , it would have only lengthened his career and helped him to recover from injuries , which would have been good for the spectators , for Fox , and certainly it would have been good for his family .<-->O
EPO is medically beneficial in a similar way .<-->N
To train in any professional athletic sport is very demanding in fact , it could be compared to a medical pathology .<-->O
Female athletes training in intense sports like cycling are at high risk of developing a dangerously low haematocrit , also known as anaemia .13 Various unrelated complaints can also cause anaemia in male athletes .<-->O
These athletes would be healthier and safer if their haematocrit was artificially buoyed with EPO .<-->N
In both men and women , EPO would also be beneficial if their haematocrit were genetically or medically depressed .<-->O
EPO also has a number of eneficial effects which are not related to its ability to increase HCT .<-->N
For example , EPO has been shown to stimulate wound healing in mice .14 We need to acknowledge that training is very hard on the human body .<-->O
Intense training for a sport like cycling causes traumatic injuries , stress injuries , inflammation and immunosuppression .15 It is similar to a medical pathology .<-->O
If we are serious about protecting the health of athletes , we need to make available the treatments which doctors would prescribe for a pathology of this nature .<-->O
Like steroids and EPO .<-->N
The Spirit of Sport Sport is the pursuit of human physical excellence -LRB- skill or strength -RRB- in a rule governed activity .<-->O
The rules of sport are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- arbitrary ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- define the nature of the activity to bring out the display of certain skills or strengths ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- allow for meaningful comparison in competitive sport to determine who is better .<-->O
The central objection to doping is that taking performance enhancers is in itself cheating because it is against the spirit of sport .<-->O
This is false .<-->N
We already allow many technologies which significantly enhance performance .<-->N
Caffeine is not illegal , even though it can strongly increase performance .<-->O
In endurance sports , caffeine helps to mobilize the fat stores of an athlete .16 It can make as much as a 20 % difference in the time to exhaustion among competitive athletes , depending on how the trial is performed .17 In the context of elite sport , that is a massive difference .<-->O
The legal dietary supplement creatine is similar to the banned drugs EPO , growth hormone and testosterone , in that it supplements an endogenous substance .<-->N
Creatine s other similarity to the banned drugs is that it is effective it can increase an athlete s time to exhaustion in anaerobic exercise by over 10 % .18 19 The reason that these performance enhancers are permitted is because they are safe .<-->O
It is inconsistent not to allow other performance enhancers if they are safe enough .<-->O
Of course we do not wish to argue that athletes should employ any and every technology in order to gain a competitive advantage .<-->O
If we allow cyclists to ride the Tour on motorcycles , they can win even if they are fat , old and unfit .<-->O
But if we allow cyclists to ride the Tour on steroids or EPO , they will only win if they are strong , fit and fast .<-->O
These drugs do not subvert the nature of the sport ; indeed , they encourage athletes to become paragons of the sporting ideal : supermen .<-->O
Cycling better than any other sport shows that drugs can be a part of the culture of that sport and not prevent the display of human physical excellence doping is as old as human competition and the Tour , because of the superhuman demands it makes , is just a very vivid example of that .<-->O
A Rational Doping Policy A rational policy on doping would allow safe performance enhancing interventions which are consistent with the spirit of a particular sport .<-->O
Firstly , we should develop safer performance enhancing drugs or interventions .<-->N
These need to be as effective as riskier options .<-->O
Ideally , they need to be no more effective when taken in harmful megadose quantities .<-->O
They need to be provided at a competitive price .<-->O
Secondly , we should focus detective efforts on those drugs and practices which detract from the athlete s project enhancing his body s performance .<-->N
Some changes , like allowing swimmers to use flippers , would reduce the importance of athleticism in a sport .<-->O
But blood doping in cycling does not .<-->N
Thirdly , we should test every athlete to make sure they are fit to compete regardless of whether or not they are using drugs It is far easier to test haematocrit -LRB- the amount of red blood cells in the blood -RRB- , and set a safe level -LRB- such as 50 % -RRB- and ban anyone who is above that level and at risk , than it is to detect the cause of that elevation , which could be natural , autotransfusion , use of hypoxic air tent , gene doping or exogenous EPO .<-->O
It is also relatively easy to test for liver damage , blood pressure and cholesterol .<-->O
We should test heart structure and function , not to see if athletes are guilty of taking steroids , but to make sure they aren t at risk of heart attack .<-->O
We could also test immunocompetence , testosterone levels and joint structure and function all of which can be influenced by steroid overuse or simply by training too hard .<-->O
In Australia , boxers are excluded from competition if they have measurable brain damage on magnetic resonance imaging .<-->N
But recent results suggest that their brains could also be protected by prescribing EPO , which provides protection against traumatic brain injury .20 The question is : what risks should athletes be exposed to ?<-->O
It is not : what is the origin of that risk ?<-->N
Setting the acceptable risk level for performance enhancing drugs should be consistent with the magnitude of risk which athletes are allowed to entertain in elite sport .<-->O
Elite sport can be extremely harmful .<-->O
More riders die in crashes than from drugs .<-->N
Even clean elite athletes have to accept serious harms to be competitive .<-->O
There is nothing special about a drug-related risk which demands that we intervene , when we permit these unnecessary non-drug risks to exist .<-->O
Concern for athletic welfare should be paramount .<-->O
But taking drugs is not necessarily cheating .<-->N
The legalization of some drugs in sport may be fairer and safer .<-->N
There is nothing wrong with an enhanced competition .<-->N
The limits to the use of drugs and other performance enhancers in sport should be on safety grounds , based on a consistent comparison with other risks taken in elite sport , and their use should not diminish the need for athleticism in the athlete -LRB- e.g. using flippers in swimming or motorcycles in cycling -RRB- and the spirit of a particular sport as a display of a human physical excellence .<-->O
We should redirect scarce resources away from the war on drugs to be used to protect athletes health and be less concerned with whether some biological substance or intervention improves performance , per se .<-->O
Zero tolerance to performance enhancement has failed and it is unfair , unsafe and ruining the sport .<-->O
Jacques Anquetil during a TV debate , asked a French politician if they expect us to ride the Tour on mineral water .<-->N
21 But today we demonise the men who courageously push themselves to the human limit and beyond .<-->N
We should admire them , rather than denigrate them .<-->O
They give us the spectacle we want , and we complain when they push themselves to the limits we expect .<-->O
Cheating occurs when the rules are broken .<-->N
But we set the rules .<-->N
The rules should define the nature and spirit of a sport , protect athletes health , provide a reasonable spectacle and be enforceable in a fair and reasonable way .<-->O
The rules should allow athletes to access medicines which protect their livelihood and help them to recuperate .<-->O
The current rules are not enforceable .<-->N
They are ruining the spectacle of cycling and they are ruining the sport for the cyclists as well .<-->N
We can achieve these goals better with a more regulated permissive approach to doping .<-->O
We have two choices : to vainly try to turn the clock back , or to rethink who we are and what sport is .<-->O
Our crusade against drugs in sport has failed .<-->N
Rather than fearing drugs in sport , we should embrace them .<-->N
Performance enhancement is not against the spirit of sport ; it is the spirit of sport .<-->O
To choose to be better is to be human .<-->N

Encouraging physical activity in the young through compulsory PE fights child obesity and contributes to forming lifelong habits of exercise .<-->N
This doesn t have to be through traditional team sports ; increasingly schools are able to offer exercise in the form of swimming , gymnastics , dance , weight training , use of a multigym , aerobics , etc. .<-->O
Students should be allowed a choice .<-->N
Lots of children don t want to do this .<-->N
If their parents agree , why should they be forced to -LRB- or forced to lie in producing a sick note -RRB- ?<-->O
It is different from any other lesson it is about what one does with one s body .<-->N
In any case , it is a red herring to say that PE makes any serious difference to people s health .<-->N
There are plenty of more effective ways of ensuring a healthy population than pushing children round a freezing sports pitch once a week ; not least would be addressing the disgusting diets our young have today , and encouraging walking or cycling to school rather than total reliance on the car .<-->O
Physical Education , Compulsory Yes because ... No because ... Physical Education is an important part of holistic schooling .<-->N
PE is an aspect of school being abou ... Physical Education is an important part of holistic schooling .<-->N
PE is an aspect of school being about more than just book learning it is about educating the whole person , a holistic education that betters us in an all-round sense , rather than a merely academic experience .<-->O
Some aspects of physical education are vital for future wellbeing , e.g. being able to swim , learning to lift heavy weights safely .<-->O
\ Arguments about cost seem petty when compared to this aim and also misguided , since PE departments would continue to exist to serve those that chose to study PE voluntarily , even if the subject were no longer to be compulsory .<-->O
Arguments about the size of classes may well be correct , but these suggest better funding for PE rather than abandonment of the commitment to public health .<-->O
\ Sport is a waste of school time and resources .<-->N
One or two PE lessons a week make very little difference to an individual s health but a huge difference to a school s budget .<-->O
It creates a whole extra department in schools , wasting a great deal of money and time that could be better spent on academic lessons .<-->O
It also requires schools buildings to be surrounded by a large amount of land for playing fields , making it prohibitively expensive to build new schools in urban areas .<-->O
The quality of teaching is low , as students are taught in huge classes .<-->N
On the other hand , the quality of teaching and of equipment goes up if there are fewer -LRB- but keener -RRB- students taking the subject .<-->N
Frankly , given the average current pupil-teacher ration , the subject is not merely without positive purpose it may be dangerous to students who are normally not properly supervised .<-->O
Physical Education , Compulsory Yes because ... No because ... School sport is about discovering gifts .<-->N
If not driven by PE , many in society wouldn t find out tha ... School sport is about discovering gifts .<-->N
If not driven by PE , many in society wouldn t find out that they had a talent for a sport , or even that they enjoyed it .<-->O
Once experienced , sport can be enjoyed for life , while for some it will provide the possibility of a college scholarship and even a career .<-->O
\ Individuals are not humiliated in PE if they are , the schools concerned should be brought to task just as they would be with regard to humiliation of students in any subject .<-->O
Rather , as UNESCO says , the student should be helped to fulfil a level of attainment in sport that corresponds to his gifts .<-->N
\ Students can discover these delights outside of school , without discovering the bullying that comes with PE more than with any other lesson .<-->N
They are more likely to obtain specialist coaching at sports clubs .<-->N
\ Furthermore , for every child that discovers a gift , there are many that suffer .<-->N
PE is unique , in that failure in its lessons involves physical humiliation .<-->O
This is bad for children and especially bad for adolescents , who have more than enough body issues without this .<-->O
\ Physical Education , Compulsory Yes because ... No because ... The quest for national sporting achievement begins in schools .<-->N

The quest for national sporting achievement begins in schools .<-->N
If we don t have compulsory PE , it is much harder to pick out athletes to represent our country on a wider stage .<-->N
Even with a sports academy model run along Australian lines , it s much easier to find suitable individuals with a full sports program in every school .<-->O
State education is not just about aiding the individual it s also about the state getting a good return on its investment in a well-educated populace to drive business and entrepreneurialism etc. .<-->O
This applies equally in sports , too .<-->N
Schools aren t supposed to be about fostering achievers for the state that smacks of Stalinism .<-->N
Schools should be tailored to the individual if the individual student doesn t want to participate in sports , they shouldn t have to .<-->N
If we allowed such national aims to be considered in schools , would we consent to humiliation of those that did badly in maths lessons , to encourage their achievement in maths -LRB- and thus business skills ? -RRB-<-->O
Of course not .<-->N
But we allow that in PE .<-->N
Physical Education , Compulsory Yes because ... No because ... Without school support , sports will collapse .<-->O

If full classes aren t made up , then team activities will end by sheer lack of numbers , no matter if several very talented individuals are at the school -LRB- or even potentially talented they ll never know without the program -RRB- .<-->O
If voluntary take-up of sport in schools is too low , then schools will shut down PE programmes so that there is no choice at all .<-->O
Not everyone is academic : why deprive those talented sports students of their one chance to shine ?<-->O
Forcing children that don t want to play to make up teams in order to allow others to shine smacks of rigid education from a bygone era .<-->O
In any case , in an increasingly litigious age , a compulsory rather than voluntary sports program is a liability .<-->O
More and more schools are avoiding the very team games -LRB- e.g. rugby , soccer , hockey , football -RRB- the proposition discusses here , due to the -LRB- realistic -RRB- fear of lawsuits .<-->O

Sport is different to , say Latin it encompasses life choices -LRB- most importantly , a concern for physical fitness , but also working in a team etc -RRB- that ought to be encouraged in all students .<-->O
Extra classes for interested students can take place separately , and often do in the form of fixtures with other schools , championships etc. .<-->N
Sport shouldn t be seen as an alternative to academia , an either/or it should be a part of every student s life in addition to their other studies .<-->N
\ If the opposition is correct about the heavy workload involved in schools , then students are that much more likely not to choose PE in an environment where it is voluntary , and the quality of our children s health will be even worse .<-->O
Much better to keep being healthy compulsory , and reform the pressures elsewhere in the curriculum .<-->O
\ Successful sporting nations like Australia realise that sports , like any other specialised subjects , are best taught to selected groups that display both talent and interest in the field forcing all to compete holds back the able and punishes the less able .<-->O
The right way to go is to liberate those that don t want to participate , and allow those that are extremely keen to go to academies that focus their talents more efficiently than a regular school ever could .<-->O
\ Furthermore , our children are burdened enough in schools already , especially at the older end of the system , with multiple examinations .<-->N
PE simply adds , needlessly , to this hectic schedule .<-->O

This is no idle question : obesity in the UK is rising rapidly .<-->N
Individuals have no right to choice about this : they re being compelled to attend school , to take the lessons the state says they should take .<-->O
The state doesn t just impose a curricular compulsion , since physical attendance is forced so there s nothing unique in principle about enforced PE .<-->O
Indeed , what can be more important as an aim for our schools than to encourage public health ?<-->N
\ It is in recognition of that fact , that in 1978 UNESCO recognised PE as as essential element of lifelong education .<-->O
\ If PE is made voluntary , it seems obvious that many students against their long term interests , and the long term interests of society will choose not to .<-->O
That will damage this essential element of education , and damage public health .<-->O
It is true that the health of society is not perfect even with compulsory PE but how much worse might it be without it ?<-->O
\ We acknowledge the right of individuals -LRB- or their parents -RRB- to control their own bodies when they have an operation , where they go , what they do .<-->O
Why is this any different ?<-->N
\ This discussion should be held in the real world : students actually aren t compelled to attend PE classes , as sick notes are produced with alarming regularity by parents complicit in their child s wish to avoid this lesson .<-->O
The aim of compulsory PE isn t being fulfilled at present in any case , and greater efforts to enforce it will only result in more deceit , or children missing school for the entire day or , in the most extreme cases , being withdrawn from state education by parents unwilling to allow their children to be forced into something they don t wish to do .<-->O
Instead , we should simply abandon the whole exercise and allow PE to become voluntary .<-->O
The UNESCO charter stresses the right to PE , and was addressed to nations that failed to provide it at all it was not meant to suggest that individuals should be compelled to do it in nations that do .<-->O
\ Physical Education , Compulsory Yes because ... No because ... Sport helps to forge character .<-->N
Playing team sports builds character and encourages students to wor ... Sport helps to forge character .<-->F
Playing team sports builds character and encourages students to work with others .<-->N
It teaches children how to win and lose with good grace and builds a strong school spirit through competition with other institutions .<-->O
It is often the experience of playing on a team together which builds the strongest friendships at school , which endure for years afterwards .<-->N
Many say the same benefits derive from the common endurance of prison In particular , injuries sustained through school sport and the psychological trauma of being bullied for sporting ineptitude can mark people for years after they have left school .<-->O
Teamwork can be better developed through music , drama , community projects , etc. without the need to encourage an ultra-competitive ethos .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Physical education has long been compulsory in many schools across the world .<-->N
Educators say it helps children to develop the habit of exercising .<-->N
But I think PE actually reduces students ' interest in sport so it should not be compulsory .<-->O
It is true that PE gives children a chance to try different types of sport , but that does not mean they will develop an interest in them .<-->O
Forcing students to do something is not an effective or efficient way of developing their interest .<-->O
As PE is one of the school subjects in which students are graded , they are more likely to see it as ` academic work ' and less likely to develop an interest in it .<-->O
Many argue that compulsory PE lessons help to ensure students do a certain amount of exercise and remain healthy , but I have doubts about that .<-->O
According to studies , children should do at least 15 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercises three times a week .<-->N
But in PE lessons , students are forced to exercise for 45 minutes or an hour .<-->N
It is very intense .<-->N
I do n't think it 's a good way of exercising .<-->N
Exercise should be a hobby that children enjoy , not an ` assignment ' that puts them off .<-->N
I think schools should not make PE compulsory .<-->O
Rather , they should encourage students to exercise on a daily basis by explaining the benefits to them .<-->O
Jessica Leung , 16 , Our Lady of the Rosary College Physical education has been a compulsory subject in schools for a long time and I think it should stay that way .<-->O
I think PE can raise students ' interest in sport and help them lead a healthy lifestyle .<-->O
In PE lessons , students learn different kinds of sport , such as basketball , tennis and so forth .<-->O
They can find out which kind of sport they enjoy playing .<-->N
They develop an interest that could turn into a hobby .<-->N
If it became a hobby , they would play it more often and lead a healthier lifestyle .<-->N
Hong Kong students have very little time to exercise .<-->N
Many studies have shown that they lack exercise and that obesity among children and teenagers is on the rise .<-->N
PE is a good way of fighting obesity and improving students ' health .<-->N
If PE became an optional subject , I think not many students would take it .<-->N
They would think it 's less important because they would not be graded .<-->O
They would want to spend more time on subjects that count in their final grades .<-->N
They would not want to spend time on courses that would not help their academic future .<-->O
This would defeat the purpose of the class .<-->N
In Hong Kong , many people are aware of the benefits of exercising , but not all of them do it .<-->N
Having PE lessons does not only raise students ' interest in sport , but also helps them turn it into a life-long habit .<-->N
What 's more , it 's easier to get the message of healthy living across to children early in life .<-->N
In conclusion , PE should be compulsory and is the way to a healthier life .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Physical education should be compulsory in school and children should have at least three physical education lessons a week , says an own-initiative report adopted by MEPs with 590 votes in favour 56 against and 21 abstentions .<-->O
The number of children who are overweight or obese is growing by an estimated 400,000 per year , yet , according to a study for the Culture Committee , the average time that primary schools allocate to physical education has fallen from 121 to 109 minutes per week since 2002 .<-->O
The report calls on Member States to make physical education compulsory in primary and secondary schools , ensure that the timetable includes at least three physical education lessons a week , and ensure `` a higher degree of integration '' between sports and academic subjects .<-->O
MEPs underline that physical education is the only school subject that seeks to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle and focuses on their physical and mental development .<-->N
MEPs also stress the need for better sports facilities and recommends that EU structural funds be used to create school and other sports facilities in disadvantaged areas .<-->O
The rapporteur , P l SCHMITT -LRB- EPP-ED , HU -RRB- said in the debate in Strasbourg on 12 November : `` I am happy that the role of sport has not been forgotten in the Lisbon Treaty .<-->O
Inactive lifestyles are becoming a serious danger to health , we ca n't afford to neglect an important tool as the physical education '' `` As a former Olympic champion , as a sports leader and as a Member of the European Parliament , it is my obligation to see how EU can contribute to the fight against obesity and promote healthy lifestyles and sport though education .<-->O
Regular exercise is important and therefore it should be obligatory to have at least three lessons of physical education a week in schools . ''<-->O
Child obesity and sport The report urges the Member States to carry out information campaigns on the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle , and engage in regular physical activity and on the health risks linked to an unhealthy diet aimed at children from a very early age and their parents .<-->O
The House stresses the importance of physical exercise in curbing obesity and overcoming unhealthy life-style habits , thereby greatly benefiting individual health , expresses concern , however , that longer working hours and present-day conditions of employment in general , are preventing workers from taking regular physical exercise and becoming more involved in sport .<-->O
A study commissioned by the Parliament 's Culture and Education Committee and written by a British academic -LRB- see link below -RRB- says that `` in some Member States the lack of sporting facilities ... and PE teachers put physical education in a difficult situation '' .<-->N
It concluded that `` PE is often sacrificed to other academic subjects '' .<-->N
The number of EU children affected by overweight and obesity is estimated to be rising by more than 400,000 a year , adding to the 14 million-plus of the EU population who are already overweight -LRB- including at least 3 million obese children -RRB- -LSB- COM -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 0637 , Green paper `` Promoting healthy diets and physical activity : a European dimension for the prevention of overweight , obesity and chronic diseases '' -RSB- across the entire EU27 , overweight affects almost 1 in 4 children .<-->O
Spain , Portugal and Italy report overweight and obesity levels exceeding 30 % among children aged 7-11 .<-->N
The rates of the increase in childhood overweight and obesity vary , with England and Poland showing the steepest increases .<-->N
In overall terms , children are less fit compared to the generation of the 1970s and 1980s .<-->N
It is not such much a higher calorie intake that causes overweight , but physical inactivity : children do not eat more - they move less .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- P.E. classes accomplish nothing .<-->N
The reasons habitually used to justify it -- health , exercise , cooperation -- are unsubstantiated at best .<-->O
I seriously question any study that alleges proof of these results .<-->N
I would first ask about the control group .<-->N
It would have to be a group of people who attended schools where P.E. was absent .<-->N
Then we 'd have to follow these two groups of people for the next 10 , 20 , 30 + years and record each individual 's measure of whole health at regular intervals and compare the results .<-->F
Then we 'd have to do it all over again .<-->F
Then we 'd have to have other researchers do the same thing in other environments to accommodate for the numerous variables .<-->F
This is how science works .<-->N
Now I ca n't be sure , but I have a strong suspicion that this has never happened .<-->O
The burdon of proof is on those who advance these alleged benefits of P.E. class ; I have yet to be convinced .<-->N
Furthermore , an open eye to one 's friends , neighbors , relatives and co-workers casts serious doubt on any purported success rate of this ideology .<-->O
P.E. class is a colossal waste of resources .<-->N
I have never seen a physical education teacher spend his or her evenings and weekends grading exams and essays , engaging students in healthy debate in the classroom , or spending an hour after school working one on one with a student .<-->O
-LRB- I am referring to academics , not extracurricular activities ; therefore , coaching a team does n't count . -RRB-<-->N
I 'm sure there are P.E. teachers that do have a very positive influence on non-athletically inclined students , but they are a chance encounter .<-->O
I seriously doubt much thought goes into curriculum development .<-->O
`` Let 's see , we 'll do flag football first , then soccer , then track ... perhaps we 'll change things up and do tennis this year . ''<-->N
This is hardly convincing .<-->O
P.E. teachers are paid the same as those teaching students to write , balance a check book , and understand human anatomy .<-->N
I could go on with other , nobler , educational efforts .<-->N
In comparison , the resources used for P.E. programs can not be justified .<-->N
Some may argue that students who actively participate in P.E. often exhibit characteristics of health and success .<-->N
These students typically have an inate ability for athletics and actively engage in sports and P.E class -- it 's easy for them .<-->O
Athletically inclined students will excel in P.E. , just as a musically inclined student would excel in Band .<-->O
A gifted basketball player may also be on the honor role , be attentive and have excellent attendance .<-->O
This is certainly true .<-->O
Nevertheless , it proves nothing about the relationship between athletics , and by proxy , P.E. class , and academic and social success .<-->N
Much emphasis is placed on , and respect given to , athletics .<-->N
As such , a student who excels at sports , however equal in every other intelectual measure , likely develops a strong sense of confidence and self-respect .<-->O
Both of these qualities significantly impact academic and social success .<-->N
To say that athletic involvement correlates positively to academic and social achievement is simply a false analogy .<-->O
It becomes clear when the social emphasis on athletics is repositioned .<-->N
Imagine that athletic ability and sports receive little attention .<-->N
They are given as much social status as is currently afforded to a 4-H club .<-->N
The quarterback of the football team is given as much recognition as the lead understudy in the school play .<-->N
Even though these students can run fast and throw a ball , peers ignore these accomplishments and the athletes are looked upon as geeks .<-->O
There is no significant social support to boost confidence and self-esteem .<-->O
Aside from athletic ability , they are equal in every other way to their peers .<-->N
The academic and social success of an athlete , when accessed in this context , will not be attributed to athletics ; it will be attributed to other individual characteristics -- as all success should .<-->O
Dissolve P.E. .<-->N
Instead , create a program that benefits all students .<-->F
`` Life Skills '' is a preferred replacement .<-->N
Teach healthy diet and safe food preparation .<-->N
Teach first-aid .<-->N
Teach household and personal safety .<-->N
Teach basic household repairs and basic auto mechanics .<-->N
Teach personal finance .<-->N
These are the real skills our youth need .<-->O
This is an investment with interest .<-->N
These are the skills that contribute to personal and community success .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you 're a recent college grad , think about this : Were you required by the university to take a P.E. class ?<-->N
Or was high school the last time you were `` forced '' to take gym ?<-->N
According to a new study in the journal Research Quarterly for Exercise and Support , the number of four-year universities that require students to take physical education classes is at its lowest ever .<-->F
Back in 1920 , 97 percent of students in four-year higher education institutions had to take P.E. .<-->F
But in 2010 , that number was 39 percent .<-->N
`` There is a remarkable disconnect in that we fund research as a nation showing that physical activity is absolutely critical to academic and life success , but we are n't applying that knowledge to our own students , '' study researcher Brad Cardinal , of Oregon State University -LRB- which requires students to take P.E. classes -RRB- , said in a statement .<-->O
Cardinal 's findings are based on data from 354 four-year colleges and universities .<-->N
Even though the study did n't come to any definitive reasons for why mandatory P.E. is becoming less common , the researchers noted that possible reasons include smaller budgets and more focus on academics .<-->O
What do you think ?<-->N
Should universities require students to take P.E. classes , or is it something people should just be doing of their own accord ?<-->O
Let us know in the comments !<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In preparation for grade 10 next September -LRB- in Ontario -RRB- , my eldest daughter has to make a number of course choices .<-->N
Carefully considering her interests as well as upcoming university admission requirements , we re weighing her options .<-->O
Only there s one course choice I wish was mandatory and not an option : physical education .<-->N
I often speak to the many benefits of physical activity for all and am a strong supporter of physical education for every child and in every school .<-->O
As is the case in Manitoba , I d like to see physical education as a mandatory course for every Canadian student until they graduate from high school .<-->N
Yes , I know that not everyone feels this way : on many occasions I ve butted heads with school administrators , principals , teachers , and parents who don t believe physical education should be a priority subject in schools .<-->O
I ve even met a few who don t think physical education belongs in schools .<-->N
Happily , I seem to be hearing from and interacting with a growing body of parents and administrators also asking : what good is education if our kids are too unhealthy and too unwell to benefit from it ?<-->O
Why is physical education so important ?<-->N
Regular physical activity is associated with a healthier , longer life and with a lower risk of heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes , obesity , and some cancers .<-->O
Physical education teaches students to integrate exercise into their lives for a lifetime .<-->N
Several large-scale studies have found improvements in students academic performance and cognitive ability with increased time spent in physical education .<-->N
Recent studies have found a strong correlation between aerobic fitness and academic performance as measured by grades in core subjects and standardized test scores .<-->N
Only 7 % of Canadian kids attain the recommended level of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day .<-->N
Without a robust physical education program , this number would be more dismal still .<-->O
Childhood obesity in Canada has tripled over the past three decades .<-->N
Regular participation in physical activity such as physical education classes at school can help foster a lifetime of healthy habits that includes the maintenance of a healthy weight .<-->O
Evidence from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study * showed that physical education programs do have an impact in combating childhood obesity in young overweight girls .<-->N
Just an extra hour of exercise a week lessened obesity in this group .<-->F

Children and youth are not using their free time for active play .<-->N
School lunchtime , after school and weekends are opportune times for kids to play actively ; however , 63 per cent of kids time after school and on weekends is spent being sedentary .<-->O
Participation in a rigorous school-based physical education program can reduce and/or offset the amount of time Canadian children spent in sedentary pursuits .<-->O
-LRB- source : Active Healthy Kids Canada -RRB- .<-->N
Let s not forget the relationship between physical activity and improved mental health .<-->N
For example , evidence suggests exercise may be as effective as psychotherapy or antidepressant medication in reducing depression .<-->N
We also know that children and youth who are physically active , tend to have better self-esteem and more self confidence .<-->O
My daughter is considering dropping physical education next year to make way for an elective course she d like to take .<-->N
She makes a strong argument in that she s quite active outside of school .<-->O
Jazz , hip-hop , swimming , walking to and from school , active time with family and friends , daily dog walks , and time spent at our local YMCA , all help her meet or exceed the recommendations set out in the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines .<-->O
Still , I m not convinced .<-->N
Just as we fitness instructors joke that there s no better way to get a workout than to have the commitment of teaching classes , the same can be said for the structure , routine and accountability that physical education classes in school provide .<-->O
Perhaps the best part for kids and teens ?<-->N
The opportunity to get active and have fun with their friends .<-->O
Let s not forget that our kids need active play , and plenty of it , for healthy development and health benefits .<-->O
In this post , I ve presented just a few of the many benefits of physical education classes for students .<-->O
There are in fact many more , along with plenty of recent research supporting the importance of more , and not less , physical activity for our kids .<-->O
What s your take on physical education in high school ?<-->N
Should it be optional ?<-->F
Should it be mandatory until graduation ?<-->N
What will you encourage your kids to do if and when they re faced with this same decision ?<-->N

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There are pros and cons to mandatory physical education -LRB- PE -RRB- classes , but the health benefits often outweigh other considerations .<-->N
With obesity concerns on the rise , PE classes are often viewed as a necessary requirement by both parents and school administrators .<-->N
Without required PE courses , some students might choose to ignore physical activity completely , focusing on sedentary pursuits .<-->O
Good Habits Required PE classes help students develop good exercise habits , resulting in healthier lifestyles .<-->N
According to the Bright Hub Education website , healthy exercise helps prevent obesity and other serious illnesses , such as heart disease , cancer , diabetes and osteoporosis .<-->O
Because most of the normal school day requires students to participate in relatively sedentary activities , mandatory PE classes force students to do something active .<-->O
The classes help students burn calories , exercise muscles , reduce stress levels and improve their psychological and physical health .<-->O
Future Health Physical education courses encourage students to lead healthy lives .<-->N
Bright Hub states that people who exercise regularly during childhood and adolescence are more likely to exercise during adulthood .<-->N
Without a PE requirement , some students might opt out of the class due to laziness or self-indulgence .<-->N
If they never exercise as students , it could be difficult for them to practice self-discipline and develop healthy exercise habits as adults .<-->O
They might also avoid future physical activity if they feel self-conscious about their lack of fitness and resulting physical limitations , especially if their adult peers are in better physical condition .<-->O
Liability Risks As important as physical activity is to health and well-being , it 's important to remember that physical education courses include fitness training , sports and games that could potentially result in physical injury .<-->O
Students who do n't have much athletic ability may not have the skills necessary to defend themselves against more competitive athletes .<-->O
Uncoordinated , weak and overweight students might get bullied by athletic students or hurt themselves while playing sports or using fitness equipment .<-->O
Even healthy , athletic students are susceptible to PE injuries .<-->N
And although students may receive similar injuries on the playground or in extracurricular sports , they can choose whether to participate -- it 's not mandatory .<-->N
Academic Conflicts Mandatory PE classes can be disadvantageous for students who have strict academic requirements .<-->O
Some students need class time to focus on advanced coursework that might help them get into competitive colleges .<-->O
Ohio news publication `` West Life '' reports that some school-board members think PE requirements should be waived for students with heavy academic loads and time-consuming classes , such as choir and band .<-->O
These students are often forced to take physical education classes during the summer in other school districts that offer them .<-->N
Mandatory PE classes limit a student 's freedom to choose where she wants to invest her time .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the runup to the last general election , when cross-party agreement was essential if any of the remaining draft legislation was to become law , the Conservatives blocked a proposal that would have made personal , social and health education -LRB- PSHE -RRB- compulsory in schools .<-->O
And this year , as this election approaches , the education secretary , Nicky Morgan , has rejected the same recommendation , this time coming from the cross-party education select committee .<-->N
Warm words now accompany the refusal on compulsory PSHE .<-->N
It should , she said , be at the heart of the curriculum .<-->N
To show she really means it , a new set of guidelines will be issued .<-->O
Put aside the question as to why Morgan is happy for some schools to ignore something she believes is at the heart of the curriculum , the real frustration is the shallowness of the approach .<-->O
The government s interest in PSHE arises from the national focus on the terrible cases of child exploitation , adolescent mental ill-health and online sexual imagery .<-->O
Something needs to be done about it , and schools should take on some of the responsibility .<-->O
The search for answers to other social ills obesity , drugs and alcohol , teenage pregnancies and youth crime has in the past been laid at the classroom door .<-->N
The faith in education s power to change social mores and entrenched behaviour is not misplaced .<-->N
However , politicians can t just lob a social crisis into the nation s schools and think it s all that needs to be done .<-->O
Demanding something be taught does not guarantee it will be learned .<-->O
This is especially the case with areas of knowledge and understanding as difficult and sensitive as those covered by PSHE .<-->O
The subject needs the best possible conditions if it is to succeed and I would suggest two that are essential .<-->O
First , it needs well-trained teachers and status in the school curriculum .<-->N
Yet the government allocates no initial teacher training places to PSHE although more than 33,000 teachers find themselves teaching it and we know it has to battle for time on the curriculum .<-->O
It s not surprising Ofsted has judged that more than 40 % of schools do not have good PSHE lessons .<-->N
Politicians can t just lob a social crisis into schools and think it s all that needs to be done Over the past five years the government has skewed the timetable towards what it calls a knowledge-based curriculum hard facts that can be learned , tested and measured .<-->O
This is what now defines a school s success and status the consequences of failing against these criteria are well understood .<-->O
Second , the complexity of the challenge needs to be understood .<-->O
Compulsory PSHE by itself won t protect young people from the dangers that surround them or make sure they make wise choices .<-->O
It needs more .<-->N
Schools don t only teach students through what goes on in the classroom .<-->N
Some develop their students self-esteem , extend their horizons and make them feel valued in a quite remarkable way .<-->O
This is not easy to measure and is impossible to grade , but its worth can be seen in the confidence and ambition of students .<-->O
Yet , where in the system is this success recognised ?<-->N
Which schools excel ?<-->N
How can we make sure others learn from them ?<-->N
There are no ways or means .<-->N
To give her some credit , Morgan has at least spoken about these issues .<-->N
I m not sure her predecessor , Michael Gove , ever did .<-->N
Despite this , the national concern about the serious risks facing this generation demands stronger leadership than the secretary of state has shown .<-->O
I don t doubt her concern or her wish to solve the problem , but her words and her actions have fallen far short of what is needed .<-->O
Schools will do the best they can , but they are not getting leadership from the top .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the overall development of a child , along with academics , which develop his mind , a child should participate in physical activities such as sports and exercises as well .<-->O
Although , researches in the field have shown that physical education should be made mandatory in schools as it develops positivity , improves the attitude and fitness of the students , yet , due to various constraints , many schools are not really able to implement this .<-->O
Lack of funds , increased emphasis on academics to up the scores in order to avail government funding ; there are various reasons behind this policy of the schools for not making physical education compulsory .<-->N
The following Buzzle article will perhaps help such school authorities , to have a fresh look at this topic ... Importance of Physical Education Fitness Obesity is a very common problem faced by numerous American kids , which if not taken care of in time , can lead to many lifestyle diseases such as heart disease , cancer and diabetes in the long run .<-->O
Engaging in physical activities help to burn calories and lose fat .<-->O
Regular exercising builds muscles , makes the immune system strong and improves upon a child 's stamina .<-->N
This increases the fitness levels and keeps various diseases and health conditions in check .<-->N
Self-esteem Physical activities help to keep a child active and focused .<-->N
When a student participates in physical activities , he becomes fit and attractive , which helps to boost his self-esteem .<-->O
After all everyone wants to look their best , regardless of age , is n't it ?<-->O
Life Lessons By participating in various sports , a student gets to learn so many things about life .<-->N
A student wins some games and loses some , this makes him understand that winning and losing are a part of life and should be accepted with grace .<-->O
When a student participates in team games , he learns that co-operating with others is very important if goals are to be achieved .<-->N
Likewise , sports can teach so many life lessons to students and thus , help them evolve mentally .<-->O
Healthy Eating During the theoretical physical education classes , a student is taught the importance of healthy eating .<-->N
He gets to know how harmful some of his favorite foods such as pizzas , burgers , cakes and aerated drinks can be .<-->O
A student is also made to understand that if he does not make healthy food choices , he can face many health problems in the future .<-->O
Equipped with this knowledge , many students inculcate healthy eating habits , by giving up high sugar and fast foods and replacing them with healthy foods like fruits , vegetables and nuts .<-->O
Hygiene Physical education classes lay great emphasis on maintaining hygiene .<-->N
They teach students how to remain clean and germ-free at all times .<-->N
Sex education is sometimes part of this curriculum too .<-->N
The safe practices taught in these classes , if followed by the students throughout their life , will save them from many diseases .<-->N
Stress Management Often times , students , particularly in their adolescent years , face various kinds of pressure and experience stress and anxiety .<-->O
Participation in physical activities can act as a stress buster for them .<-->N
Researches have shown that when a person exercises , the levels of cortisol , a stress hormone , get reduced .<-->N
Moreover , a person who exercises every day , is able to sleep better , thus giving enough time to his body to repair and restore .<-->O
This proves that by making an exercise routine , a student can remain stress-free , relaxed and concentrate more on his studies and other important things .<-->N
Productivity Researches show that students who participate in physical activities have high energy levels and are more alert than those who led sedentary lifestyles .<-->O
Due to these very reasons , the productivity of such students in various spheres of life , including their studies , improves considerably .<-->O
As can be seen , physical education contributes so much towards making a child grow into a healthy , intelligent , confident and level-headed adult .<-->O
It can be rightly said that it 's not just for individual growth , but for the improvement of the whole society , physical education should be made an important part of the school curriculum .<-->O

IN PICTURES - An Olympic education : schools where Team GB Olympians are made The Coalition insisted that head teachers should be given the freedom to organise physical activity themselves instead of following a bureaucratic system .<-->N
It was also feared that many schools were shunning competitive sport and favouring disciplines such as yoga and circus skills to hit targets imposed by the previous Labour government .<-->N
But the move will raise fears that some children may not be getting access to the necessary amount of exercise every week .<-->O

It was also revealed this week that Michael Gove , the Education Secretary , has approved the sale of more than 20 school playing fields since the last General Election .<-->N
Officials insisted most became surplus when existing schools closed or amalgamated .<-->N
But the figures could prove embarrassing for the Government as the nation continues to be swept along by the success of the London Olympics and Team GB s medal haul .<-->O
Today , the Youth Sport Trust criticised the decision to scrap the two hour PE target , claiming it was now difficult to identify which schools were failing to provide enough lessons .<-->O
Measuring the number of young people participating in two hours of school sport did give a clear indication of participation levels in sport in schools across the country , a spokesman said .<-->N
There is still some great work going on in schools but it is now more difficult to know exactly where provision is good and where it needs to be improved .<-->O
Under the previous Government , all children of compulsory school age were expected to take part in two hours of sport a week .<-->N
By 2009/10 , some 86 per cent of pupils were meeting the target .<-->F
Labour later outlined a long-term goal of ensuring children did five hours a week of physical activity during lesson time or after school .<-->N
As part of a new school sport strategy published in late 2010 , the Coalition axed the last Government s targets including the new five hour offer claiming they led to a decline in the number of children taking part in traditionally competitive sports such as rugby union , netball and hockey .<-->O
A sports census completed by schools every year was also scrapped .<-->N
But a statement released at the time suggested that all schools would be expected to continue providing two hours a week of PE and sport .<-->F
Today , the Department for Education insisted that this was no longer the case .<-->N
Instead of handing down target and quotas from Whitehall , we have chosen to trust teachers and parents when it comes to deciding how much sport pupils should do , a spokesman said .<-->O
We want to strip away the red tape that takes up too much time teachers should be using to teach , run sports clubs or plan lessons .<-->O
In the past , schools were heavily over-burdened with paperwork and form-filling .<-->N
Speaking earlier this week , Mr Hunt said : I think at the moment school sport provision is patchy in some places , and we need to do what we can to make sure that the very best examples are spread throughout the whole country , and this is absolutely going to be a focus over the next few months and one of the things that we really want to take away from these Games . ''<-->O
The presumption of critics of David Miliband 's view that terrorism can be justified is , Natalie Hanman points out , that the state has a monopoly on violence , which therefore legitimates the use of it , and that any other group using violence is illegitimate .<-->O
If this were true , then , when Nelson Mandela dies , he should be universally condemned as nothing more than a terrorist and murderer something the Thatcher government liked to call him .<-->N
This is not a serious position to hold .<-->N
Alternatively , we might say that the violence employed by all states , at least if they are western democracies , is illegitimate .<-->O
Again , the many cases of the necessity of war September 1939 , for example invalidate this position .<-->O
So , what we can say is that if we agree with the aims of a group , then violence is an ethically acceptable extension of the struggle ; and if we disagree , it is not .<-->O
These judgments need not be merely subjective but can be weighed up in the same way that any set of political actions are weighed up .<-->O
While we may not reach an objective basis for the support of the armed struggle in one context as against another , we can at least suggest principles that are reasonable and then defend those principles .<-->O
But more than this , we are also therefore forced to accept that the use of violence against `` soft targets '' is terrorism in whatever cause it is employed ; the difference is that we might support some causes and not others because we see them as morally virtuous or vicious .<-->O
It was on this basis , belief in the cause , that Miliband was defending the anti-apartheid activist Joe Slovo .<-->O
The use of violence , whether by states or other groups , should be based on the same argument as that used to justify a declaration of war `` just war '' theory .<-->O
But let us not pretend that the causes we believe in are not using terror to further their aims just because we believe in them , or that the use of terror is not central to the possibility that they will be successful .<-->O
The choice of terms here is not between freedom fighter and terrorist but between murderer and terrorist the former simply killing nihilistically because they are killing in a cause we do not believe in , and the latter using violence as part of an achievable and just political project with which we agree .<-->O
Miliband 's critics say that his justification for the ANC 's armed struggle is giving comfort to the enemy in Afghanistan .<-->O
How does this fit that case ?<-->N
The Taliban are not merely a tribal group set on removing foreign invaders from their land ; they have run a murderous state that sponsored war against other states , and now they make war on their own people to recreate that state with all the human rights violations they previously employed .<-->O
They have a political strategy , but it is not more realistic than that of their allies in al-Qaida .<-->N
I can understand how you could construct an argument that makes their use of violence legitimate , but I reject it .<-->O
The ANC , though , was also a terrorist group -LRB- through its military wing , Umkonto we Sizwe -RRB- .<-->N
So how can we decide between these groups ?<-->N
The difference is that the ANC deployed terror for the political purpose of destroying an obscene system that would not have been defeated otherwise .<-->O
The economic boycott was important , but would the world have launched the boycott without the armed struggle ?<-->O
Would the people repressed under the apartheid police state have kept faith with the ANC if there had not been a dimension of armed resistance to the struggle ?<-->O
I doubt it very much .<-->O
In the case of the Taliban , the strategy is to regain and hold power through terror , and run a state based on the suppression of human rights and the sponsorship of international terrorist attacks against civilian targets .<-->O
The means and the ends of the Taliban 's cause strike me as the opposite of just , and are entirely illegitimate .<-->O
But each of these groups can correctly be called terrorist and should be referred to as such but that is where the analysis should begin , not end .<-->O
What were , or are , they each fighting for ?<-->N
Or against ?<-->N
How do they use terror ?<-->N
Who are their targets ?<-->N
What is their political strategy ?<-->N
These are the questions that need to be asked .<-->N
In assessing a campaigner 's life , as Miliband was doing , you have to look at the broad picture .<-->N
When the Maquis , for instance , were killing German troops and when the Warsaw Ghetto rose up , they killed every enemy they could find .<-->N
They wanted to hurl some of the terror that they had faced back in the faces of their oppressors .<-->O
Were they terrorists in the sense that they used terror to further their cause ?<-->O
Yes , they were .<-->N
But their cause was just and their violence justifiable .<-->O
When the Nazis who survived formed the Werwolf resistance groups and attacked the occupying allied forces , were they terrorists ?<-->N
Yes , they were .<-->N
But the end they fought for was obscene and so they also deserved to be called murderers .<-->O
It is not the term itself that matters , but the cause for which the violence is used that should concern us .<-->O
Will the troops in Afghanistan be demoralised by Miliband 's defence of the armed struggle against apartheid ?<-->N
I doubt it very much .<-->O
Members of the British armed forces , in my experience , have a lot more political sense than many of the politicians who choose to speak for them .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------ Terrorism , as defined by Webster s , is the unlawful use or threat of violence especially against the state or the public as a politically motivated means of attack or coercion .<-->O
Terrorists use violent tactics in an effort to create political change , threaten or induce fear in the public and/or government , raise media attention or further their political cause .<-->O
Unfortunately , many times , terrorist attacks fall upon innocent victims .<-->N
One may argue as to the degree of innocence each individual may have .<-->N
Terrorist attacks in current history most always end in the killing of children .<-->N
There can be no argument as to a baby s innocence .<-->O
Terrorism when inflicted on innocent civilians can never be justified .<-->N
Killing others for any reason other than self-defense is morally reprehensible .<-->N
Kant believes in a universal law .<-->N
Morally , we must treat humanity never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end .<-->O
In other words , terrorists can not morally justify innocent deaths to achieve some ultimate goal .<-->O
R.G. Frey and Christopher Morris have similar beliefs that , terrorists can not avail themselves of such theories to justify furthering the ends of some small group at the cost of greater damage to the interests of others .<-->O
Even if we disagree with Kant , Frey and Morris , and assume that the terrorist s goals were justifiable , terrorist attacks in no way guarantee a set end result .<-->O
Although a terrorist would achieve his goal of threatening and inducing fear in the public by performing a terrorist act , there is no guarantee that such an act will either create the political change the terrorist is trying to achieve , or attain the desired response by the government or the public .<-->O
The media attention that is derived from the act may or may not be conducive to the terrorists objectives .<-->N
One may argue that the terrorists are justified in their actions .<-->N
Those in support of the terrorist attacks would most likely also support the attackers cause .<-->O
For example , a group of terrorists may bomb the white house because they believe that President Bush is corrupt and is killing innocent people in Iraq and Afghanistan without just cause .<-->O
The terrorists believe that if they bomb the White House and kill the President , the Bush administration will fall , and the wars in the Middle East will end .<-->O
There may be some who agree with these terrorists , and believe that they are justified .<-->O
Take a life for a life .<-->N
Bush is responsible for the deaths of thousands , so his death is warranted .<-->O
However , if the supporters of these terrorist attacks would examine the consequences of the attack on the White House in more detail , they may change their stance .<-->O
How do we measure the attacker s success ?<-->N
Is success measured by number of deaths or the fall of the house of Bush ?<-->N
What if the Bush administration does fall , but more and greater corruption follows ?<-->N
How about the innocent lives at the White House that will be lost during the attack ?<-->O
Taking innocent lives is the very thing the terrorists so greatly oppose .<-->O
This is a contradiction in belief .<-->O
How do we assess the value or cost of the fear and terror that this attack will instill on the entire nation ?<-->O
Is this also a desired result ?<-->N
Do we know for certain that widespread panic and total chaos will not ensue in the aftermath of such a heinous act ?<-->O
And it is doubtful that such an act would in fact immediately end the Middle Eastern wars .<-->O
An attack on the White House would impose a significant impact on our current government and public climate .<-->O
Immediate and severe actions would be taken .<-->O
However , these terrorists did not exhaust all legal possibilities .<-->N
R.G. Frey and Christopher Morris state that alternatives such as passive resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience must first be attempted .<-->O
We have created a legal system to create change as well as protect the public .<-->N
Our society has created various means for voicing our disapproval , without the need for violence .<-->O
These terrorists can vote , form groups and foundations , peacefully protest , and write letters to our elected officials .<-->N
They have the freedom to join activists , or even travel to the Middle East and volunteer .<-->N
All these methods will not produce immediate results , and our judicial system is not without faults .<-->N
But these systems were put in place to protect an individual from harm , and protect those individuals personal rights .<-->O
The knowledgeable death of innocents can never be justified .<-->N
W.D. Ross suggests that we have a moral obligation , a prima facie duty to non-maleficence .<-->O
It is our ultimate responsibility to not harm others .<-->O
And Richard Wasserstrom also affirms that there are no circumstances under which the intentional killing of innocent persons , even in time of war , can be justified .<-->O
It is always immoral to do so .<-->N
Many individuals would claim terrorism can never be justified .<-->O
The word never conveys an absolute .<-->N
Absolutes tend never to hold true .<-->N
There always seems to be grey areas , or caveats which are exceptions to every rule .<-->N
We can rephrase the absolute statement to terrorism usually can not be justified , but in some rare instances , is justifiable .<-->O
In the event that all political means of mediation have been exhausted , and lives of innocent people are threatened or the basic needs of life -LRB- food , shelter , sanitation -RRB- are deprived , then those individuals would be justified in fighting for self preservation through means of terrorism .<-->O
This act of terrorism must be geared towards those responsible with the insurance that no innocent civilian lives are lost .<-->O
Maybe then , a word other than terrorism should be used in this instance .<-->N
Maybe a better word , based on this definition , would be revolution .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------ Can Terrorism Ever Be Justified ?<-->N
Note : This is in no way related to eRepublik ; this revolves around real life issues .<-->N
Hello everyone , I have taken the time to do extensive research on whether terrorism can be justified .<-->N
I have concluded personally that it can not .<-->N
It is a matter of opinion , and I would like to hear other people s thoughts on this subject .<-->O
What exactly is terrorism ?<-->N
Terrorism is the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective .<-->O
Terrorism has been practiced by political organizations with both rightist and leftist objectives , by nationalistic and religious groups , by revolutionaries , and even by state institutions such as armies , intelligence services , and police according to Merrian-Webster s Dictionary .<-->O
Terrorism is the unlawful use or threat of violence especially against the state or the public as a politically motivated means of attack or coercion .<-->O
Terrorists use violent tactics in an effort to create political change , threaten or induce fear in the public and/or government , raise media attention or further their political cause .<-->O

Why terrorism can not be justified .<-->N

There are no circumstances under which the intentional killing of innocent persons , even in time of war , can be justified .<-->O
It is always immoral to do so .<-->N
Is it really terrorism ?<-->N
How can you tell ?<-->N
We can rephrase the absolute statement to terrorism usually can not be justified , but in some rare instances , is justifiable .<-->O
In the event that all political means of mediation have been exhausted , and lives of innocent people are threatened or the basic needs of life -LRB- food , shelter , sanitation -RRB- are deprived , then those individuals would be justified in fighting for self preservation through means of terrorism .<-->O
This act of terrorism must be geared towards those responsible with the insurance that no innocent civilian lives are lost .<-->O
Maybe then , a word other than terrorism should be used in this instance .<-->N
Maybe a better word , based on this definition , would be revolution .<-->O
Terrorism can not be justified , as it is nearly always the case that aggressive acts of terrorism are perpetrated by individuals who do not represent the majority of society .<-->N
Maybe you could argue that `` terrorism '' is a political term .<-->O
Governments call actions terrorist to automatically code them as unjustified .<-->N
One person 's terrorist is another 's freedom fighter .<-->N
Also , you can argue that it is difficult to distinguish terrorism from other forms of political violence .<-->O
Is an assassination a terrorist attack or an act of war ?<-->N
During WW2 , Allied forces had several opportunities to assassinate Hitler , was it a terrorist act ?<-->N
So , maybe you can ask a bigger question , is political violence -LRB- riots , war , intimidation tactics ... -RRB- ever justified ?<-->O
It seems easier to answer yes to that question because it is of less value and does not provoke the same intense response as `` terrorism '' does .<-->O
One interesting example might be Colombian paramilitary groups who fight leftist guerillas -LRB- like the FARC -RRB- because the government has very limited control -LRB- and is often not even present -RRB- in rural areas .<-->O
They call themselves `` Self-Defense Forces , '' and believe they are doing everything they can to protect the country .<-->N
Of course , others label them terrorist .<-->N
When do their actions become terrorist instead of self-defense ?<-->N
Thank you for reading , please share your thoughts .<-->N

Intimidating , I know .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------ Terrorism is almost always morally unjustified , but it may be justified as the only way of preventing a moral disaster Can terrorism ever be morally justified ?<-->O
Igor Primoratz writes on the nature of terrorism and whether it is possible to defend terrorist attacks in isolated cases .<-->O
He argues that definitions of terrorism can not be based on the identity of those resorting to it and must therefore be extended to include state terrorism .<-->O
He concludes that while terrorism is almost always unjustified from a moral perspective , under specific , extreme conditions , terrorist acts may be defended on account of the moral disaster they prevent or stop .<-->O
The worldwide public debate about terrorism that has gone on for more than a decade now has involved mostly scholars with backgrounds in political science , international relations , law , and public policy .<-->O
It has also included politicians and ordinary citizens .<-->N
The debate has great urgency as we are reminded , time and again , of the ubiquity of the terrorist threat .<-->O
Nonetheless , there isn t much agreement on any of the main questions raised by terrorism conceptual , moral , or political .<-->O
This is understandable in view of some basic flaws of the debate .<-->O
One is the lack of clarity about what its subject is : just what is terrorism and who should count as a terrorist ?<-->O
Perhaps inevitably , the debate has often been clouded by emotions , moral passions , and political interests .<-->O
Infested by moral relativism and double standards -LRB- us / them , state use of force/insurgent terrorism -RRB- , it has often led to talking at cross purposes .<-->O
Philosophy can make a significant contribution to this debate at two levels : the conceptual and the moral .<-->O
Philosophers are good at spotting and disentangling confusions and debunking double standards .<-->N
Although some embrace some version of relativism , others can help overcome it , and put to rest the pernicious clich one person s terrorist is another s freedom fighter .<-->O
Philosophers normally avoid conflating the conceptual and moral levels of debate .<-->O
This makes it possible to construct a definition of terrorism that doesn t beg the moral and political questions .<-->O
They bring to bear major ethical theories , introducing order into an array of moral arguments for and against terrorism and helping people decide what position best reflects their moral values and political commitments .<-->O
1972 Munich Terrorist Attack -LRB- Associated Press -RRB- If we are to define terrorism in a way helpful to the moral and political debate , we should put aside both the identity of those resorting to it and their ultimate political , ideological , or religious aims .<-->O
We should rather understand terrorism in terms of just what is done and what the proximate aims of doing it are .<-->O
Such a definition should be morally and politically neutral , and facilitate , rather than pre-empt , a well-focused moral debate .<-->O
Terrorism , then , is the deliberate use of violence , or threat of its use , against innocent people , aiming to intimidate some other people into a course of action they otherwise wouldn t take .<-->O
Being agent-neutral , the definition doesn t rule out state terrorism a phenomenon well known in modern history , yet curiously ignored , or defined out of existence , in public debate .<-->O
Indeed , historically , the state has been the greatest terrorist .<-->N
One major account of the morality of terrorism is provided by consequentialism : terrorism , like everything else , should be judged solely by consequences .<-->O
When its rationally expected consequences are good on balance , it will be morally justified .<-->N
As Leon Trotsky famously said , given a paramount end , the question of the means becomes one of expediency rather than principle .<-->O
But surely it can t be right that life and limb of innocent civilians is fair game whenever it is expedient that it should be so .<-->O
Here , as elsewhere , consequentialism proves much too permissive with regard to questionable and even repugnant means .<-->O
Terrorism can t be judged solely by its consequences ; first and foremost , it is a great wrong intrinsically , because of what it is : a violation of basic rights and a gross injustice .<-->O
A clear alternative to consequentialism is an absolute prohibition of intentional killing and maiming of some ordinary citizens in order to terrorise and coerce others .<-->O
This may be thought as obvious a moral truth as any .<-->O
But it is difficult to back this intuition with an argument that converts those who don t share it .<-->O
And it is ever more difficult to uphold the absolutist position , as the critic constructs ever more catastrophic scenarios that can be averted only by terrorism .<-->O
Should we insist on rights and justice even if the heavens fall ?<-->O
What of a middle-of-the-road view ?<-->N
Terrorism is wrong in itself , for it violates some of our most important rights and constitutes a grave injustice .<-->O
Still recourse to it may be morally permissible , if a people or a political community finds itself in extremis , and terrorism is the only way out .<-->N
But then , just when is a people or a polity in extremis ?<-->N
Michael Walzer s statement of this view in his seminal book Just and Unjust Wars operates with the notion of supreme emergency , when deliberate attacks on innocent civilians are the only way of coping with an imminent threat to the survival and freedom of a political community .<-->O
I find this vague and too permissive .<-->N
My view is structurally similar , but much more restrictive .<-->O
Terrorism is almost absolutely wrong , and may be considered only -LRB- i -RRB- in the face of a moral disaster , understood in a special , highly restrictive sense : as an imminent threat of extermination or ethnic cleansing of an entire people , and -LRB- ii -RRB- when there are good reasons to believe that terrorism is the only way of preventing the disaster , stopping it in its tracks , or reversing a wide range of its consequences .<-->O
This is a good place to give some historical and contemporary examples of a morally justified act or campaign of terrorism .<-->N
But I don t have any .<-->N
Does this undermine my view of terrorism , showing that it has no purchase on reality , and offers no practical moral guidance ?<-->O
I think not .<-->N
It is as it should be .<-->N
Terrorism is the deliberate use of often lethal violence against innocent people for the sake of intimidating and coercing some other people .<-->O
Such an extreme type of violence , used in order to terrorise and coerce , ought to be extremely hard to justify .<-->O
So it shouldn t be thought odd that no case of terrorism so far has been morally justified , or that any resort to it in the future is extremely unlikely to be .<-->O
After all , terrorism is almost absolutely morally wrong .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------ That is a really hard question .<-->N
In Syria they were doing that in hopes of killing Bashar Al-Assad in Damascus but they did n't put the bombs anywhere near enough and ended up killing a bunch of civilians , particularly children .<-->O
The scene was horrifying .<-->N
If they had succeeded they might have saved thousands more innocent lives but instead their sloppiness ended up killing more and saving none .<-->O
I do n't know exactly what is going on there now , I have n't heard much in the last few weeks since North Korea started all its threats .<-->O
I myself do n't think it can be justified .<-->N
I do n't know .<-->N
If you stoop to the level of being willing to kill innocents just for a chance at the enemy then I think the question should be raised of whether your side deserves to win at all .<-->O
I think terrorism is more along the lines of cowardice .<-->N
I think war is a stupid way to solve differences but us humans seem unable to solve things any other way when it comes down to it .<-->O
Geez , that is a hard question Zoran .<-->N
What do you think ?<-->N
Terrorism is never justified .<-->N
Terrorism is about striking at civilian targets in order to produce fear , chaos , and government crackdowns on civil institutions to create civil unrest -LRB- which , in turn , produces more fear and chaos -RRB- .<-->O
It 's not `` freedom fighting '' or `` guerrilla warfare '' ... to put it bluntly , it 's f *** ing cowardice .<-->N
If you have an issue with a government or military authority , you strike at targets associated with that authority : offices , supply dumps , bases , etc. .<-->N
You encourage civilians employed at those places to sabotage machinery and jam up security checkpoints .<-->O
In short , you do what you can to confine the fighting to the enemy whenever possible .<-->N
Will there be collateral damage ?<-->N
In war , people get hurt .<-->N
It 's inevitable .<-->N
That 's why it should be a last resort .<-->N
The point is to try and minimize that damage wherever possible .<-->O
Terrorists , however , do n't do that .<-->N
They strike at innocents deliberately : dance clubs , markets , the World Trade Center ... the list goes on .<-->N
It 's as dishonorable as it gets .<-->N
It 's also counterproductive : nothing sways people against you more than killing them , especially when you 're only doing it to make their lives more complicated .<-->O
What happens then when you 've been brainwashed or basically told outright that there are no civilians in this war ?<-->O
That 's sadly what a lot of things I 've read have shown me .<-->N
That there were and therefore are no civilians in war .<-->N
I do n't think we can judge those who truly believe there are only combatants in a war environment because of brainwashing or lies -LRB- like those who dropped the bombs in WW2 I 'm not so sure they knew why they were doing it or what it would do -RRB- .<-->O
But we should hold leaders somewhat accountable .<-->N
I think that targeting civilians is a different thing to terrorism in the above situations but I still think it is something that should not ever really need to be or have been done .<-->O
Unfortunately it often stems out of the belief that one country has to invade another for their best interests along with the interests of global peace -LRB- of course keep in mind that the US never joined a war unless their own interests were at stake -RRB- .<-->O
And therefore using bombs or something similar -LRB- drones -RRB- becomes much easier and simpler .<-->O
I do n't believe terrorism is ever justified .<-->N
I do n't believe torture is truly justified on a moral level , though it may be necessary .<-->O
That 's the unfortunate nature of humans and life .<-->N
Some things which are never justifiable may be viewed as necessary for the long run .<-->O
That 's what interested me the most about Watchmen , the idea that some things may be seen as necessary though not morally right .<-->O
And of course we have the idea of the ` hero ' stating that one should never compromise .<-->O
In essence terrorism is bullying amplified with advanced weaponry to the point where they can cause as much chaos and scaremongering as possible .<-->O
Bullying is never justified , therefore terrorism is ten times upwards worse .<-->O

In extreme cases , in which peaceful and democratic methods have been exhausted , it is legitimate and justified to resort to terror .<-->O
In cases of repression and suffering , with an implacably oppressive state and no obvious possibility of international relief , it is sometimes necessary to resort to violence to defend one s people and pursue one s cause .<-->O
Terrorism is never justified .<-->N
Peaceful and democratic means must always be used .<-->N
Even when democratic rights are denied , non-violent protest is the only moral action .<-->O

In many countries terrorists have succeeded in bringing governments to negotiate with them and make concessions to them .<-->N
Where governments have not been willing to concede to rational argument and peaceful protest , terrorism can compel recognition of a cause .<-->O
Nelson Mandela moved from terrorist to President .<-->N
In many other countries we see this trend too in Israel , Northern Ireland , recently in Sri Lanka , and in the Oslo peace process that led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority .<-->N
Therefore , terrorism is justified by its success in achieving results when peaceful means have failed .<-->O
Terrorism does not work .<-->N
It antagonises and angers the community that it targets .<-->N
It polarises opinion and makes it more difficult for moderates on both sides to prevail and compromise .<-->O
A lasting and peaceful settlement can only be won with the freely given consent of both parties to a conflict or disagreement .<-->O
The bad-feeling caused by the slaughter of hundreds , perhaps thousands , of innocent people by terrorists makes such consent desperately difficult to give .<-->O
Furthermore , states or institutions created in concession to terror are often corrupt , dominated by men of violence with links to organised crime .<-->O
Nothing is achieved to improve the lives of the people in whose name terror has been used .<-->N

States can use their wealth and media to put across their side of the story ; their opponents do not have these resources and perhaps need to resort to terrorism to publicise their cause .<-->O
In this way , limited and focused use of violence can have a dramatic international impact .<-->N
All publicity is definitely not good publicity .<-->N
Powerful images of suffering and death will permanently mark the terrorists cause , losing the battle for public opinion around the world .<-->O
Furthermore , groups that resort to terrorism play into the hands of their opponents ; states suffering from terrorism can win powerful support from similarly affected nations , such as the USA , in combating this threat .<-->O
Terrorism , Justification for Ideals like freedom and liberty are more important than a single human life ; they are what gives ... Ideals like freedom and liberty are more important than a single human life ; they are what gives meaning to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people .<-->O

Abstract ideals are insignificant when compared to the value of even a single life .<-->O
Life is sacred , and to murder anyone in pursuit of an idea or even the improvement of other people s lives is shocking , abhorrent and wrong .<-->O
No one has the right to say another person s life is worthless , or worth less than the cause which is pursued through terrorism .<-->O
Terrorism , Justification for Actions should be judged by their consequences .<-->N
In bringing hope , popular recognition , and ultimatel ... Actions should be judged by their consequences .<-->O
In bringing hope , popular recognition , and ultimately relief to the plight of a group , terrorism is aimed at laudable objectives and can achieve sufficient good to outweigh the evil of its methods .<-->O
The end does not justify the means .<-->N
The consequences of any action are by no means clear .<-->N
The success of terrorism is not guaranteed ; it is an immoral gamble to kill people in the hope of achieving something else .<-->O
And even if the goal was realised , the price paid is literally incalculable .<-->N
Those who use violence in the pursuit of higher aims presume to be able to calculate suffering .<-->O
But the fear , suffering and death caused by terrorism damage millions of people .<-->O
Not just the victims are affected , with their families and fellow citizens , but also people in many different countries who are put at risk because terrorists from other countries are inspired by these atrocious acts .<-->O
Terrorism , Justification for The definition of terrorism depends very much upon your point of view - the proposition does not nee ... The definition of terrorism depends very much upon your point of view - the proposition does not need to defend every atrocity against innocent civilians to argue that terrorism is sometimes justified .<-->O
A broad definition would say terrorism was the use of violence for political ends by any group which breaks the Geneva Conventions -LRB- which govern actions between armies in wartime -RRB- or ignores generally accepted concepts of human rights .<-->O
Under such a broad definition , states and their armed forces could be accused of terrorism .<-->O
So could many resistance groups in wartime or freedom fighters struggling against dictatorships , as well as participants in civil wars - all irregular groups outside the scope of the Geneva Conventions .<-->O
Effectively , such a definition says that the armies of sovereign states should have a monopoly on violence , and that they can only act in certain ways .<-->O
Some exceptions to this are surely easy to justify - e.g. the actions of the French resistance to German occupation in World War II , or of American patriots against the British in the 1770s .<-->O
A narrower definition would say that terrorism was the use of violence against innocent civilians to achieve a political end .<-->O
Such a definition would allow freedom fighters and resistance groups with a legitimate grievance to use force against dictatorship and occupation , providing they only targeted the troops and other agents of oppression .<-->O
Yet even this tight definition has grey areas - what if the soldiers being targeted are reluctant conscripts ?<-->N
Are not civilian settlers in occupied territories legitimate targets as agents of oppression ?<-->N
What about their children ?<-->N
Does n't it make a difference if civilians are armed or unarmed ?<-->N
Do n't civil servants such as teachers and doctors count as agents of an occupying or oppressive state ?<-->O
States who ignore the Geneva Conventions , for example by mistreating prisoners or deliberately attacking civilian targets , are guilty of terrorism and this can not be justified .<-->O
Nor are the Conventions only applicable to warfare between sovereign states - their principles can be clearly applied in other kinds of conflict and used to distinguish between legitimate military struggle and indefensible terrorism .<-->O
Nor is it reasonable to argue that there are grey areas , and that civilians are sometimes legitimate targets - once such a claim has been made anything can eventually be ` justified ' in the name of some cause .<-->O
All too often the political leaderships of protest movements have decided that limited ` physical force ' is necessary to advance their cause , only to find the violence spiralling out of control .<-->O
The ` hard men ' who are prepared to use force end up in control of the movement , which increasingly attracts criminals and others who love violence for its own sake .<-->O
The original base of support for the movement in the wider population and internationally is alienated .<-->O
The authorities against whom the movement is struggling also respond by using increasingly repressive measures of their own , generating a spiral of violence and cruelty .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------ Nothing can justify terrorism ever , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the opening of a high-level meeting of the Security Council today , capped by a presidential statement expressing that body s deep concern over the terrorist threat and its determination to combat it by all means in all its forms and manifestations , in line with the United Nations Charter and international law .<-->O
We have to drown out shrill appeals to intolerance and extremism with sound calls for compassion and moderation , said Secretary-General Ban .<-->O
In social media networks , which terrorists and extremists increasingly were exploiting to radicalize people and spread hate , the terrorist narrative must be replaced with messages of peace , development and human welfare , he said .<-->O
Citing challenges in Mali and the broader Sahel region , where , he said , terrorism was feeding off extreme destitution and undermining development through violence , intolerance and human rights abuses , he welcomed the Council s resolve to tackle the challenges there head on and said he counted on all its members , and all in the international community , to unite in advancing that important work .<-->O
In its agreed statement , the Council stressed that terrorism could only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive approach involving the participation and collaboration of all States and international and regional organizations .<-->O
It recognized that the scourge would not be defeated by military force or security forces , law enforcement measures and intelligence operations alone .<-->O
In that connection , it underlined the need to address the conditions conducive to terrorism s spread , including strengthening efforts to prevent and peacefully resolve conflict , promote the rule of law , protect human rights and fundamental freedoms , good governance , tolerance and inclusiveness .<-->O
The statement reaffirmed that Member States should refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State , and from providing any form of support , active or passive , to entities or persons involved in or associated with terrorist acts , including by suppressing recruitment of terrorists and eliminating their weapons supply .<-->O
The need to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism was underlined , as was the use of sanctions as an important tool in countering the phenomenon , in the context of fair and clear procedures for placing individuals and entities on sanctions lists and for removing them .<-->O
Additionally , note was taken of the Secretary-General s recommendation to appoint a counter-terrorism coordinator .<-->N
When the floor was opened for statements , Pakistan s Foreign Minister , whose delegation holds the Council presidency this month , said her country has led from the front to combat terrorism , in a comprehensive approach based on three Ds : deterrence , development and dialogue .<-->O
She urged special emphasis on creating employment opportunities for people in regions scarred by terrorism so that terrorists can not lure them to their side .<-->O
The endeavour overall was a long haul , she said , encouraging Member States to brace for it , prepare for it .<-->O
A lopsided or uni-dimensional approach will not work as we try to defeat this hydra-headed monster .<-->O
Pakistan s enemy is our enemy , declared the Senior Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom , offering her condolences for the victims of the latest attacks in that country and agreeing that it was indeed on the front line of a threat that was more diverse and more fragmented , but , equally , was more determined than ever .<-->O
A military response was sometimes unavoidable , she said , while at the same time urging recognition of the link between instability and terrorism , and poverty .<-->O
In Yemen , she noted , access to justice , jobs and services must be expanded , and in Somalia , support must continue for police training , improving access to health care and humanitarian assistance .<-->O
Financing was the lifeblood of terrorists , and thus , effective standards must be enforced to dry it up .<-->O
The language of today s interventions was strong as speaker after speaker held that terrorism was , as China s Vice Minister described it , the arch enemy of all mankind .<-->O
So , too , was the expressed commitment to decisive action in the context of a comprehensive approach and sustained international cooperation to contain the ongoing threat , which weighed on all nations and all peoples .<-->O
With the phenomenon mutating , adapting , exploiting new tools and technologies and benefiting from ever-available funding sources , speakers stressed the need to blunt the scope and magnitude of the assault with foolproof policies and practices , and strict adherence to existing instruments .<-->O
The link between development and security was highlighted , as fragile States were seen as especially vulnerable to terrorism , and unemployed young people at greater risk of recruitment .<-->O
Several supported the Secretary-General s suggestion to appoint a counter-terrorism coordinator .<-->N
Closing the meeting , Pakistan s representative said it had been a full and comprehensive debate that lived up to the importance and scope of the topic .<-->O
Condemnation of terrorism had been unequivocal , and determination to address and combat it had been strong and unambiguous .<-->O
The importance of a comprehensive approach for more effective counter-terrorism efforts had been a recurring theme .<-->O
Also speaking at the Ministerial or Cabinet level were representatives of Luxembourg , Morocco , Russian Federation , United States , Argentina , Togo , Azerbaijan and Rwanda .<-->N
Statements were also made by the representatives of Guatemala , Australia , Republic of Korea , France , Brazil , Egypt -LRB- on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Conference -RRB- , Senegal , Liechtenstein , New Zealand , Malaysia , Turkey , Syria , Bangladesh , Iran -LRB- on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement -RRB- , Indonesia , Japan , India , Israel , South Africa , Venezuela , Nigeria , Kazakhstan , Canada , Uganda , Armenia , Spain , Afghanistan , Botswana , Switzerland , Norway , Tunisia , Colombia , Sri Lanka , Cuba , C te d Ivoire -LRB- on behalf of the Economic Community of West African States -LRB- ECOWAS -RRB- , and Saudi Arabia .<-->F
The Head of the European Union delegation also spoke .<-->N
Making further statements were the representatives of Iran and Turkey .<-->N
The meeting began at 10:03 a.m. , was suspended at 1:08 p.m. , resumed at 3:10 p.m. and adjourned at 6:59 p.m. Background The Security Council met today to convene a high-level open debate on A comprehensive approach to counter-terrorism .<-->O
It had before it a concept note prepared by the President -LRB- S/2013/3 -RRB- .<-->N
Secretary-General BAN KI-MOON , United Nations Secretary-General , welcomed Pakistan s Foreign Minister and expressed condolence for the victims of recent repeated terrorist attacks in Pakistan .<-->N
He reiterated the Organization s strong support and solidarity for the Pakistani Government s efforts to combat terrorism and defend the country s institutions and freedoms .<-->O
He noted solid progress in countering terrorism in the past year .<-->O
In June , the General Assembly recommitted to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and , through a consensus text , strengthened the global resolve to support victims of terrorism everywhere and to adopt a comprehensive anti-terrorism approach based on respect for human rights and the rule of law .<-->O
No counter-terrorism policy could be effective without addressing conditions that are conducive to the terrorism s spread .<-->O
Development and security were critically linked .<-->N
Nothing can justify terrorism ever .<-->N
No grievance , no goal , no cause can excuse terrorist acts , he said .<-->N
At the same time , the conditions that fed the problem endemic conflicts and human rights violations that went unpunished must be removed .<-->O
Dialogue and understanding were crucial .<-->N
We have to drown out shrill appeals to intolerance and extremism with sound calls for compassion and moderation , he said .<-->O
In social media networks , which terrorists and extremists increasingly were exploiting to radicalize people and spread hate , the terrorist narrative must be replaced with messages of peace , development and human welfare .<-->O
Progress in those areas would demand steady efforts by States individually and collectively .<-->O
He lauded three upcoming conferences on the subject .<-->N
In April , the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force -LRB- CTITF -RRB- Working Group on human rights while countering terrorism , a new project on human rights training for counter-terrorism law enforcement officials , would hold its first conference in Amman .<-->O
In two weeks , the CTIFT United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre would hold an International Conference on National and Regional Counter-Terrorism Strategies , in Bogota .<-->N
And this summer , the CTITF and the Swiss Government would host a conference of counter-terrorism focal points aimed at addressing conditions conducive to the terrorism s spread .<-->O
States needed capacity-building to respond to the financing of terrorism , which remained a key threat .<-->O
The Counter-Terrorism Committee s special meeting on that subject last November , chaired by India s Permanent Representative , was an important step .<-->N
He urged humanitarian , security and political actors to engage in an open , sustained policy dialogue to ensure that anti-terrorism acts never thwarted timely , principled delivery of aid to civilians .<-->O
This is all the more important as we cope with increasing humanitarian emergencies around the world , he said , citing challenges in Mali and the broader Sahel region , where terrorism was feeding off of extreme destitution and undermining development through violence , intolerance and human rights abuses .<-->O
He welcomed the Council s resolve to tackle the challenges in that region head on .<-->N
He was deeply moved by the brave efforts of Malala Yousufzai , the young Pakistani girl shot by extremists , to champion the fundamental right to education .<-->O
Malala and her schoolmates have shown tremendous courage .<-->O
Their grace and integrity challenge the world to respond to the terrorist threat with the comprehensive and broad-based approach that is essential to success , he said , adding that I count on all members of this Council and all members of the international community to unite in advancing this important work .<-->O
Statements HINA RABBANI KHAR , Foreign Minister of Pakistan , presiding over today s meeting as Council president for the month , said that the terrorism threat is not for today or tomorrow , or for the next week or for a year .<-->N
It is a long haul .<-->N
We all have to brace for it .<-->N
We all have to continue to prepare for it .<-->N
As a threat to international peace and security , terrorism had a direct bearing on all countries and regions , on individuals and societies .<-->O
The last decade had shown that the scourge knew no geographical boundaries , and that a lopsided or uni-dimensional approach will not work as we try to defeat this hydra-headed monster .<-->O
After a decade of fighting terrorism , she said , everyone here was deeply aware of the unintended consequences of political decisions that could fuel it .<-->O
Short-sighted methods could offer the scourge ideological fodder .<-->N
She sought a comprehensive and interlocking approach , which was much more effective than the present effort and which was geared towards not only winning the battles , but winning the war .<-->O
Terrorist networks must be attacked and dismantled because they defy the writ of the State and kill civilians .<-->O
All must persevere in their efforts to deter and defeat terrorists militarily .<-->O
However , she continued , terrorism would not be defeated by law enforcement measures , or intelligence operations or military and security strategies alone .<-->O
Terrorists misleading , distorted and malicious narrative , and their demented ideology that justified the killing of innocents , must be quashed by the international community .<-->O
She pointed to the interrelationship between development and security , adding the need for special emphasis on creating employment opportunities for people in regions scarred by terrorism so that terrorists can not lure them to their side .<-->O
Nothing worked better than allowing preferential market access to products produced within regions wracked by terrorism , she said .<-->O
Even more important was dialogue , and a rule of law , protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and good governance and tolerance should also be fostered .<-->O
She cited several reasons why counter-terrorism should be high on the Council s agenda , including that terrorism continued to mutate into newer and different forms .<-->O
Also , regional cooperation was necessary , and Pakistan and Afghanistan had taken steps towards a strategic relationship to jointly fight the scourge .<-->O
Terrorism was a serious threat to Pakistan , which had been one of its biggest victims .<-->N
Its comprehensive approach was based on three Ds : deterrence , development and dialogue .<-->N
The entire nation , Government , judiciary and civil society were determined to fight it .<-->O
Indeed , the country had led from the front in the global fight , but success had come with a heavy cost for Pakistan and its people .<-->N
Nevertheless , Pakistan s community resilience has been second to none .<-->N
JEAN ASSELBORN , Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg , said the threat of terrorism was serious and spreading , as demonstrated by the situations in the Sahel , and in Pakistan , which had very recently been the victim of terrorist attacks .<-->O
His Government strongly condemned terrorism as unjustifiable criminal acts that must be prosecuted and punished , regardless of the perpetrators .<-->O
Luxembourg was committed to the European strategy against the scourge and also backed the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy , which had expanded the framework of the fight to not only include security measures , but also towards ensuring the respect for human rights and addressing root causes .<-->O
This strategy provides a comprehensive approach allowing for more effective responses to the threat by combining security , rule of law , development goals and the protection of human rights , he said , calling on Member States to strengthen and enhance United Nations capacities in such areas as conflict prevention , rule of law , peacebuilding and development .<-->O
The fight against terrorism must be grounded by a fundamental respect for human rights and good governance .<-->O
Indeed , he said , experience had shown that serious violations of human rights might even create conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism .<-->O
In the same vein , counter-terrorism strategies must pay due attention the promotion of tolerance , dialogue and to respect for diversity .<-->O
The United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization -LRB- UNESCO -RRB- had a major role to play in that regard , as did the Alliance of Civilizations .<-->N
He went on to say that his Government supported the work of the Security Council s relevant counter-terrorism committees , and stressed that sanctions were an important tool in the international combat against the scourge .<-->O
He again reaffirmed the need to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights and to that end welcomed relevant measures adopted by the Security Council , and extended his Government s full support to the work of the Office of the Ombudsman , established in 2009 .<-->O
Before concluding , he stressed the need to bolster global efforts to counter terrorist financing .<-->O
As an international financial centre , Luxembourg was conscious of its special responsibilities in that regard , and its Government had , therefore , adopted a modern and coherent arsenal of legislative and regulatory measures to combat money-laundering and other illicit financial flows .<-->O
SAYEEDA WARSI , Senior Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom , said Pakistan was on the front line of terrorism and making enormous sacrifices , including in lives lost .<-->O
Her country understood the terrible losses inflicted on the Pakistani people , and it would continue to offer its sympathy and steadfast support .<-->O
After all , Pakistan s enemy is our enemy .<-->N
Terrorism was among the most pressing and challenging of threats , thus requiring a united and comprehensive response .<-->O
The world had changed since the 11 September attacks and other terrorism atrocities , and globalism had made the scourge increasingly interconnected , its boundaries less clearly defined .<-->O
Indeed , the threat was more diverse and more fragmented , but equally , terrorists were more determined than ever .<-->N
She welcomed the call for a more comprehensive approach to counter-terrorism , in terms of the number of countries working together and in terms of the range of tools employed to defeat it .<-->N
A military response was sometimes unavoidable , but the link between instability and terrorism , and poverty , should be recognized .<-->O
In Yemen , for example , access to justice , jobs and services must be expanded .<-->N
In Somalia , support must continue for police training and securing access to health care and humanitarian assistance .<-->O
Her country s broader counter-terrorism effort would include work to bring countries out of poverty and build stability .<-->O
Work in both development and defence must also continue , and it should not be forgotten that financing was the lifeblood of terrorist networks .<-->O
She welcomed the work of the United Nations and other international bodies in setting effective standards to combat that financing .<-->N
Terrorism , she continued , also exploited technological opportunities and , thus , it was crucial to prevent cybercrime .<-->N
The United Kingdom , in addition , was working to combat drug and human trafficking .<-->N
Her country supported the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy , and it underscored the importance for all efforts to conform at all times with international law .<-->N
Specifically , it must be ensured that the collective capacity to arrest , detain and prosecute be in accordance with such standards .<-->O
The United Nations was uniquely placed to lead the struggle , but with some 31 bodies around the world involved in that fight , she supported the Secretary-General s call to appoint a United Nations coordinator .<-->N
CUI TIANKAI , Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of China , said that Pakistan was at the forefront of the international efforts to counter terrorism and that country s efforts had been recognized by the entire world .<-->N
China rejected terrorism in all its forms and would continue to support Pakistan s efforts to counter the scourge .<-->O
Overall in the past years , some progress had been made and the threat of terrorism had declined , but the situation remained quite serious , as terrorist activities remained rampant in some parts of the world and the situation in some regions opened space for the activities of terrorist operatives .<-->O
Moreover , some organizations were joining together and the combat against the scourge remained a long and uphill battle .<-->O
He said that in combating terrorism , it was important to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity .<-->O
It was also important to achieve global consensus on counter-terrorism measures .<-->O
China supported the work of the Council in shaping a global response , and he stressed that it was essential for all countries to abide by the Council s edicts and the measures set out in the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy .<-->N
At the same time , he stressed that terrorism could not be eradicated through military means alone .<-->N
Indeed , a comprehensive political , development and diplomatic approach was necessary .<-->O
In addition , the international community must reject selectivity ; all forms of terrorism must be tackled equally regardless of motives and perpetrators .<-->O
Indeed , the international community must speak in one voice and act in concert to deter and eradicate the global scourge .<-->O
China had faced its share of terrorist acts , carried out by Eastern Turkistan Islamist Movement and associated groups .<-->N
Those groups had caused heavy losses in the country .<-->F
Definitive evidence abounds , he said , stressing that such actions threatened China , the region and the international community .<-->N
China had long backed the United Nations framework and Security Council resolutions on the issue , and it had also signed agreements with global and regional groups to help tackle terrorist funding and money-laundering .<-->N
Finally , he said that while the world had made significant steps to counter terrorism , there was still a long way to go .<-->O
The international community should continue to press ahead in a comprehensive manner .<-->O
YOUSSEF AMRANI , Minister Delegate for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation , Morocco , said that as Chair of the Counter-terrorism Committee , Morocco was committed to working with all Member States to strengthen action towards a strategic , transparent approach and to further coordinate technical aid to improve Member States capacity to combat terrorism .<-->O
He commended the CTITF and expressed Morocco s commitment to working with other members of the Advisory Board of the United Nations Centre on Counter-Terrorism to develop capacity-building .<-->N
The United Nations must , however , bolster efforts , adapt responses to new patterns of terrorism and diversify its partnerships with regional and subregional organizations .<-->O
Morocco was ready to pursue discussions on all proposals that sought to enhance coherence , coordination and effectiveness of United Nations counter-terrorism efforts , including the Secretary-General s proposal to appoint a counter-terrorism coordinator .<-->O
The United Nations should seek more interaction with other multilateral initiatives to fight terrorism , he said .<-->O
The 2006 Statement of Principles adopted by the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism offered a way to unite and share experience and expertise .<-->N
The Rabat Memorandum adopted last year by the Global Forum against Terrorism on Good Practices for Effective Counterterrorism Practice in the Criminal Justice Sector gave a set of norms for an effective criminal justice response to terrorism .<-->O
An active member of the Forum , Morocco hosted in October 2012 a workshop on Transnational Security Challenges in the South Atlantic , which identified ways to strengthen global cooperation and build the necessary capacity to counter terrorism , transnational crime and illicit networks .<-->O
Morocco had established a comprehensive counter-terrorism approach based on tolerance , human rights , the rule of law and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Strategy .<-->O
It had firm law enforcement measures and a dedicated counter-terrorism justice system .<-->O
For years , Morocco had warned the global community about the deteriorating situation in the Sahel , which was today the centre stage for alarming terrorist activity , he said .<-->N
He supported Mali s recent call for external aid to combat terrorist elements .<-->N
The United Nations needs to speed up and intensify its efforts in assisting the Government of Mali and in ensuring a prompt deployment of -LSB- African-led International Support Mission in Mali -RSB- on the ground , he said , stressing that bilateral support and resources , including through the holding of a donors conference , were vital .<-->O
He reiterated Morocco s calls for a sustainable framework for dialogue , cooperation and solidarity among all States of the Sahel and the Maghreb to address the critical situation in the Sahel .<-->O
Joint responsibility , inclusive cooperation and constructive partnership must prevail over narrow political calculations .<-->O
ALEXANDER ZMEEVSKY , Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation in the fight against Terrorism and Transnational Organized Crime , said that , unfortunately , the terrorist threat had not declined .<-->O
He pointed to the savage attacks a few days ago in Pakistan , offering his sympathy and hope for a speedy recovery .<-->O
Terrorism was quickly adapting to new realities , acquiring a new dimension and gravity , in regions previously unscathed .<-->N
It was exceptionally dangerous and hard to predict , and it threatened international peace and security .<-->O
New , serious problems in the context of counter-terrorism security were accumulating in conflict areas , including in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East .<-->O
Terrorism crossed borders , it was fast-arming , and it constantly developed new funding sources .<-->N
It also meshed with organized crime , including in West Africa and the Sahel region .<-->N
He underlined the threat posed by Al-Qaida and the Taliban in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region , which continued to generate terrorist threats , with a heavy reliance on the narcotics trade .<-->N
Terrorism , he said , was an untraditional adversary it was not linked to international obligations , it bore no responsibility to society and had its own coordinates in international relations .<-->O
It also involved the training of rebels .<-->N
Terrorism and violent extremism were very dangerous trends , which were determined to spread , under slogans of reformed democracy and calls for street protests , sometimes under Al-Qaida flags with the portrait of Osama bin Laden in plain view .<-->O
Against that backdrop was a growing destructive wave of radicalism , which provoked tensions in various regions and created favourable conditions for bringing new adherents , especially young people , into the movement .<-->O
Indeed , terrorism now was woven into the very fibre of armed conflict , such as what was being seen in Mali .<-->O
The Council needed a common approach , yet it displayed a lack of a consolidated position , especially in the context of the Syrian events unfolding against the backdrop of Al-Qaida-linked terrorism .<-->O
He called for transnational efforts and effective cooperation to defeat the threat .<-->O
Much had been done , and he pointed in particular to the effective global response system , which included a solid treaty base .<-->O
However , the level of participation must be expanded .<-->N
The United Nations had an essential coordinating role to play .<-->N
Counter-terrorism also required simultaneous development , as well as improved cooperation of law enforcement agencies .<-->O
Timely and appropriate reaction remained a priority issue for the United Nations and Security Council .<-->N
His country attached vital importance to the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee , the 1267 and 1988 Committees on , respectively , Al-Qaida and the Taliban , and said in closing that it was also critical to maintain a focus on sanctions and to prevent nuclear terrorism .<-->O
SUSAN RICE -LRB- United States -RRB- joined others in expressing deep condolences to Pakistan for the recent spate of terrorist attacks against that country , which reminded all that the scourge of terrorism remained a serious threat .<-->O
She said that while the Council had taken major steps to enhance the international counter-terrorism framework , terrorists , nevertheless , thrived and continued to threaten all States , posing grave dangers at national and global levels .<-->O
Indeed , the insidious activities of Al-Qaida and other groups was evident in , among other regions , the Arabian Peninsula , the Islamic Maghreb and the Horn of Africa , where they continued to sow instability , destabilize societies and obstruct delivery of humanitarian goods and services .<-->O
The diffuse nature of modern terrorism made it clear , she continued , that long-term diplomatic and economic initiatives were indispensible .<-->O
While we have made progress together , terrorist groups continue to adapt , she said , noting that such groups continued to incorporate new measures , such as kidnapping , in their deadly arsenals .<-->O
The international community must do much more to combat the scourge ; with the threats ever more diffuse , the need for a comprehensive global strategy was more necessary than ever .<-->O
While force was indeed often necessary , it was not nearly enough to comprehensively counter the threat of terrorism over the longer term .<-->O
As such , it was necessary to adopt holistic strategies that incorporated development and socio-economic measures that could help counter extremism and stem the pipeline of recruits .<-->O
Such broad action would , she said , ensure that all States were better able to counter the scourge of terrorism within their borders and regions .<-->O
The United States was doing its part to that end , training legal advisers and helping nations bolster their judicial capacities to deal with terrorism and to disrupt terrorist financial networks .<-->O
In addition , the United States was also cooperating in the work of the Centre for Strategic Counter-Terrorism Communications , set up to disrupt and rebut extremist propaganda online .<-->O
The United States would continue to work closely with United Nations efforts to ensure the necessary architecture was in place to address terrorism in the twenty-first century .<-->O
The Organization had a critical role to play as a forum for collective action against terrorism , and she supported the call of the Secretary-General to appoint a counter-terrorism focal point .<-->O
The United States looked forward to working with the Council and other Member States in promoting the Council s anti-terrorism measures .<-->N
At the same time , she encouraged all Member States to enhance their cooperation with civil society groups to ensure a cooperative and comprehensive approach .<-->O
MARIA DEL CARMEN SQUEFF , Undersecr etary for Foreign Affairs of Argentina , also advocated a comprehensive approach and stressed the priority role played by the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies .<-->N
The Council should ensure the effectiveness of those bodies .<-->O
In all cases , solving the problems should avoid consequences for the populations concerned .<-->O
The new terrorism threats had led to the understanding of the need for solidarity .<-->O
Counter-terrorism efforts must be strengthened in those areas where conditions existed for the scourge s spread , particularly where the rule of law was not respected .<-->O
She said that neither religious nor ethnic differences , nor economic circumstances could justify terrorism .<-->O
Rule of law with full social inclusion and dignified work counter-balanced terrorism .<-->O
Argentina had tragically suffered State terrorism and its consequent human rights violations .<-->O
That had led to a strengthening of State policies , particularly with regard to memory , truth , justice and redress , and it had galvanized support on the international stage for the progressive development of that concept .<-->O
Argentina had supported the creation of a Special Rapporteur in the Human Rights Council , as well as the Convention on Enforced Disappearances .<-->N
Argentina , as a victim of terrorism in 1992 and again in 1994 , was convinced that the scourge must be fought in the framework of rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms , including due process and human rights .<-->O
Terrorism was made worse by its capacity to undermine public institutions and domestic security , and actions to counter it must correspond to the risks a country faced , he said , pressing for greater emphasis on prevention .<-->O
In Argentina , that responsibility fell to the Ministry of National Security .<-->N
The Security Council must continue efforts through its relevant bodies to promote international cooperation in that regard and , as part of that endeavour , judicial cooperation in terms of both extradition and legal assistance .<-->O
He urged Member States to incorporate and apply in their internal legislation international legal instruments and United Nations resolutions to ensure that those accused of terrorism did not benefit from legal vacuums .<-->O
Work must be augmented on speedy and effective mechanisms to freeze funding and dismantle the economic structures that support terrorist organizations .<-->O
Argentina had drafted a law to implement the relevant Council resolutions , particularly the provisions to freeze funds .<-->N
KOFI ESAW , Minister , Senior Adviser to the President for diplomatic matters and cooperation of Togo , said that , unfortunately , the tireless efforts to deal with terrorism had not achieved the hoped-for results .<-->O
Terrorism was taking better advantage of technologies and the financial resources flowing from crimes of all kinds , including illicit drug trafficking and ransom payments .<-->O
Terrorists also had a propensity to operate through business and non-governmental organizations , which further complicated efforts to counter the phenomenon .<-->N
As the threats became more complicated , States were forced to spend much more to combat them , at a time when they were dealing with numerous pressing challenges , such as fighting poverty and implementing sustainable development objectives .<-->O
He said it was important to get a handle on the various manifestations and mutations of terrorism , in order to do a better job of fighting it .<-->O
It was also vital to know more about its motives and motivations what prompted individuals to flirt with terrorism .<-->O
He suspected that was generated by social vulnerabilities and frustrations , particularly among young people , who were prepared to offer their services in order to survive .<-->O
Development and security interacted as causes and consequences of terrorism , and it was also important to recall that terrorism often enjoyed the leaven of extremism and religious sectarianism , used as an affirmation of a criminal group s views .<-->O
One motivation could be the globalization of economies and societies , whereby States were competing with , and even defeated by , private interest dominated more and more by profits than values of human dignity .<-->O
Unfortunately , the financial and economic crises of the last few years had dug a deeper hole between rich and poor and provoked frustration , despair and even the loss of the will to live .<-->O
That vulnerability was exploited by terrorist groups as they recruited members .<-->N
However , he said , even if poverty , discrimination and prejudice nourishes terrorism , there could be no justification for it , since there were frameworks for dialogue , negotiation and compromise .<-->O
But , given the scope of terrorist acts with often catastrophic consequences for States and regions as was the case for the Sahel , including Mali and Somalia the international community must remain mobilized .<-->O
He welcomed the United Nations counter-terrorism efforts and strategy , and felt revisiting the approach allowed it to be updated in line with the changing face of terrorism .<-->N
Togo also fully supported the work of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate and the committees spawned by relevant Council resolutions .<-->N
His country had always made counter-terrorism a major priority and taken on the various legal instruments adopted under United Nations auspices , as well as by regional organizations , such as the African Union .<-->O
Given the impact of poverty , inequality and intolerance on the spread of terrorism , he was convinced that the security and jurisdictional dimensions of countering it could only be effective if such factors as good governance , development , strengthened dialogue among civilizations and peaceful resolution of disputes were also taken on board .<-->O
YASHAR ALIYEV , Special Envoy of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan , said his country had been a repeated target of terrorist attacks .<-->N
Indeed , the activity of well-known State-sponsored international terrorist groups , whose ideology is based on historical and religious prejudice and hatred , is a serious threat to Azerbaijan s national security and the security of the region as a whole .<-->O
His Government had repeatedly drawn attention to such threats and had called on all States to combat the scourge in all its forms , including through the establishment of a more coordinated and comprehensive United Nations approach .<-->O
Azerbaijan had consistently taken steps to implement its respective obligations and contribute to the global fight against terrorism .<-->O
With that in mind , he noted that his county would be hosting in early March an international Conference on Strengthening Cooperation in Preventing Terrorism , co-organized by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime -LRB- UNODC -RRB- and the Islamic Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization .<-->N
He said that that Conference would bring together Heads of State and Government , as well as ministers and heads of international organizations and members of civil society and academia , with the aim of initiating in-depth discussions on the challenges posed by terrorism and how they could be surmounted .<-->O
The Conference would also aim to promote relevant international cooperation and generate concrete ideas and technical assistance proposals towards strengthening national capacities .<-->O
Speaking more broadly , he said that the changing nature of terrorism was extremely worrying , requiring a comprehensive international approach to counter it .<-->O
While major steps had been taken in that regard under the auspices of the United Nations , a number of areas continued to require constant attention , including the situations in conflict-affected territories , especially those under foreign military occupation , which provided fertile ground for terrorist and other non-State actors to use violence to achieve their goals .<-->O
He said that the accumulation of weapons and ammunition on such territories posed the risk of proliferation to such illegal actors .<-->O
While recognizing the significance of addressing all conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism , he stressed the need to intensify conflict resolution efforts on the basis of international norms , especially the respect for territorial integrity .<-->O
Calling for cooperation on helping States address capacity gaps in the fight against terrorism , he also stressed that the war on terrorism must not be used to target any particular religion or culture .<-->O
To that end , all States must support the various initiatives carried out by , among others , the Alliance of Civilizations .<-->O
Azerbaijan was a member of that initiative s Group of Friends and was actively engaged in promoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue .<-->N
EUG NE-RICHARD GASANA , Minister of State in Charge of Cooperation , Rwanda , strongly condemned all forms of terrorism .<-->N
Rwanda had ratified the 14 universal anti-terrorism instruments .<-->N
It had embraced the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its action plan .<-->N
Rwanda had ratified the Organization of African Unity s 1999 convention on preventing and combating terrorism .<-->F
He commended the anti-terrorism work of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee and of the African Union .<-->N
Rwanda would continue to engage with global , regional and bilateral partners to prevent and combat terrorism .<-->O
Effective steps to counter and prevent terrorism required adequate national legal and institutional frameworks , rooted in the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights .<-->O
Rwanda had implemented the recommendations of Council resolution 1373 -LRB- 2001 -RRB- through such frameworks and a national counter-terrorism committee equipped with a national focal point and members of different national security organs , as well as through a functional counter-terrorism unit within the Rwanda National Police .<-->O
Rwanda also had adopted laws to prevent and penalize money-laundering and financing of terrorism , he said .<-->N
The Rwanda National Police s Financial Investigation Unit operated within the National Bank of Rwanda .<-->N
Rwanda was a member of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group and the East African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organisation .<-->F
Both operated in line with resolution 1373 -LRB- 2001 -RRB- .<-->N
He expressed particular concern over terrorism in Africa .<-->O
He condemned Al-Shabaab in Somalia , Ansar Dine and other Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb-affiliated organizations in Mali and North Africa , Boko Haram in Nigeria and other terrorist groups on the continent .<-->N
Conflicts and statelessness in several African countries provided a fresh breeding ground for terrorism .<-->N
It was no coincidence that terrorists regularly attacked peacekeepers and threatened troop-contributing countries .<-->N
Resolving conflicts on the continent was an absolute priority to bring peace and stability in the present , and prevent widespread terrorism and its spread .<-->O
It was crucial to address terrorism s root causes , he said .<-->N
Terrorism in the Arab world was a reminder of the urgent need to find a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .<-->O
Attention must be paid to terrorist groups that changed names and acronyms upon being classified as terrorist , and later masqueraded as political organizations .<-->N
A case in point was the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .<-->N
It had been a product of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda , which , upon being blacklisted , changed its named and acronym , but retained all its terrorist characteristics .<-->N
GERT ROSENTHAL -LRB- Guatemala -RRB- said his country rejected all forms of terrorism .<-->N
Preventive action was needed within the framework of international cooperation .<-->N
The United Nations played a fundamental role through conventions , protocols and strategies .<-->N
As noted by the Global Strategy , terrorism must not only be addressed within the realm of defence and security .<-->O
The sources of tension over ethnic , religious and ideological differences must also be addressed .<-->N
A special role must be given to the virtue of tolerance .<-->O
At the same time , counter-terrorism measures must not be used as a pretext to violate basic human rights .<-->O
In that regard , adoption of a comprehensive terrorism convention was long overdue .<-->O
Such a convention would help prevent impunity for those that committed terrorist acts ; facilitate cooperation and mutual legal aid among States to bring to justice perpetrators of terrorist acts ; offer a definition for terrorism , allowing for its universal criminalization ; and fill existing gaps in the Council s work , particularly in Committee 1373 and the measures applied by the sanctions committees .<-->O
He was concerned with terrorism s link to transnational organized crime .<-->O
Criminal cartels operating in Latin America and terrorist groups both had absolute disdain for human life .<-->O
Already , terrorists joined cartels to finance their violent acts .<-->N
In the future , the cartels could join terrorist groups as a way to accumulate illicit wealth .<-->N
He stressed the need for a comprehensive , holistic approach to address the complex phenomenon and said greater coherence of efforts was needed among the different United Nations entities tackling terrorism .<-->O
The efforts of the Council s diverse subsidiary bodies to combat terrorism were too decentralized .<-->N
He expressed doubts over the level of coordination between the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and the various Secretariat departments .<-->N
Council members should begin discussing among themselves whether there was enough internal coherence to carry out the work of the various sanctions committees .<-->O
GARY QUINLAN -LRB- Australia -RRB- expressed his condolences for the terrible attacks in Pakistan last week .<-->O
Good intelligence , strong law enforcement and prosecution were not enough to tackle terrorism .<-->O
Its drivers , narrative and processes of radicalization must also be targeted .<-->O
Prevention and strengthened cooperation and coordination within and among States were crucial .<-->N
States had succeeded considerably in prosecuting terrorists and degrading major terrorist networks .<-->O
For example , in Southeast Asia , Indonesia had prosecuted more than 600 terrorists since the 2002 bombing in Bali .<-->N
That shared success in law enforcement had exposed that prisons were in many cases a weak link in counter-terrorism efforts .<-->O
Terrorists continued to recruit and plan attacks from prisons .<-->N
It was vital to effectively manage and rehabilitate extremist detainees , share best practices and develop common strategies .<-->O
Australia , Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries were using the work of the Global Counterterrorism Forum to develop regional approaches .<-->N
Societies must be strengthened in order to reject the violent extremism that fuelled terrorism .<-->O
To do that , everyone must have a voice and access to education and work , he said , noting that youth unemployment was one of the greatest vulnerabilities of all regions .<-->O
Promoting values such as tolerance , understanding and dialogue within and between religions and cultures and respect for diversity could help communities resist the terrorists message .<-->O
The rule of law must be strengthened and there must be equality before the law in order to remove a potential grievance often exploited by terrorists .<-->O
States must be innovative in using modern telecommunications to promote those values .<-->O
The Alliance of Civilizations and interfaith dialogue were still crucial .<-->N
States must strengthen collaboration with regional networks .<-->N
The Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation had trained more than 12,000 officers , building understanding of the common challenges and diverse needs of the region , strengthening personal relationships and developing a sense of common purpose .<-->O
More regional facilities like the Centre were needed .<-->N
He called for the appointment of a United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator .<-->N
KIM SOOK -LRB- Republic of Korea -RRB- said that over the past decade , the international community had made concerted and cooperative efforts to achieve progress in countering terrorism , such as significantly weakening Al-Qaida s core operatives in Afghanistan .<-->O
Still , the threat of terrorism remained serious , and Al-Qaida was still a source of concern , especially as its regional affiliates expanded their spheres of influence in such regions as Northern Mali and the Southern Arabian Peninsula .<-->O
The threat of home-grown terrorism was also increasing , he said , adding that terrorist organizations were becoming more sophisticated , bolstered by new information and communications technology , and were including in their deadly arsenals such acts as kidnapping and piracy .<-->O
Since no State could counter terrorist activity alone , it was imperative for the international community to improve its cooperation in areas such as law enforcement , information sharing and the combat against terrorist financing .<-->O
In all that , it would be crucial to strengthen the capacities and preparedness strategies of all Member States , he said , stressing the role played by the United Nations in that regard .<-->N
He went on to acknowledge and welcome the Organization s efforts , including through the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy , the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and the relevant task force .<-->O
The Republic of Korea also supported the Secretary-General s call for the appointment of a counter-terrorism coordinator .<-->N
He went on to stress that military efforts alone could not effectively eradicate terrorism and such measures must be backed by efforts to enhance socio-economic and environmental conditions .<-->O
We need to deal with the diffusion of violent extremism by marginalized groups .<-->O
We need to solve unemployment problems and expand educational opportunities , he said , in that regard , and added that collective efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals would be a big step in the overall strategy to counter terrorism .<-->O
MARTIN BRIENS -LRB- France -RRB- said that with the evolution of terrorism , the international community must now confront all kinds of shadowy organizations , including from Al-Qaida , which harmed the security of entire regions .<-->O
He was thinking , in particular , of the Sahel and Horn of Africa .<-->N
Those groups exploited regional weaknesses and could be the rear guards targeting neighbouring States .<-->N
Indeed , they could jeopardize the very existence of a State .<-->O
The Council , in resolution 2085 -LRB- 2012 -RRB- , had emphasized the importance of the situation in northern Mali , including for the Sahel and international community overall .<-->N
Since the text s adoption , the problem had intensified , and France had responded to a request by the Malian authorities to deal with it .<-->N
He urged the international community to show unity and solidarity in the face of the terrorism threat and to avoid any legal vacuum .<-->O
In that , it was vital to effectively implement existing instruments and adopt long-term strategies .<-->N
The United Nations must establish a permanent legal framework and define , for once and for all , their obligations to combat terrorism .<-->N
Relevant Security Council resolutions had established obligations in that regard and called for a whole range of actions .<-->N
Additionally , the United Nations promoted cooperation and , through its Strategy , sought to bring together existing mechanisms and strengthen coordination among States and organizations .<-->N
A comprehensive approach was needed both to eliminate terrorism and to prevent its spread .<-->O
Terrorists access to funds must be blocked and security policies must be established to beef up fragile States , which were often most vulnerable to the scourge s spread , he continued .<-->O
Those policies should be accompanied by development and good governance programmes .<-->N
The international community , for its part , must assist those States in that and regional strategies should also be established .<-->O
That was the approach of the European States in the Sahel one part security and one part development .<-->N
Capacity-building and rule of law promotion were also essential components to combat terrorism .<-->N
MARIA LUIZA RIBEIRO VIOTTI -LRB- Brazil -RRB- said Brazil was a long-time supporter of global anti-terrorism efforts .<-->N
It had always condemned terrorism in all its forms .<-->N
The concept of repudiating terrorism was enshrined in the Brazilian Constitution and was a guiding principle of Brazil s foreign policy .<-->N
Terrorism must be addressed through a holistic approach , taking into account its diverse underlying causes .<-->N
Development and inclusiveness were key tools for combating terrorism .<-->N
An advocate of the interdependence between peace , security and development , Brazil commended the approach in Pakistan s concept note in that regard .<-->O
Brazil fully supported the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy .<-->N
Focusing on prevention meant promoting democratic values , international cooperation for social and economic development , as well as political , ethnic and religious tolerance .<-->O
Counter-terrorism should never justify disregard for basic individual rights and the rule of law .<-->O
The fight against terrorism must be in compliance with international law and human rights law .<-->O
She encouraged the Council to continue reflecting on ways to strengthen due process within the 1267 and 1989 sanctions committees .<-->N
The work of the Ombudsman was a valuable tool for increasing fairness when considering requests for delisting .<-->O
Cooperation and capacity-building were essential for fighting terrorism .<-->N
Many countries had the political will to implement the Council s pertinent resolutions , but they lacked the necessary capacity to do so .<-->O
She lauded the fact that capacity-building was a top priority for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre .<-->N
She commended the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee in facilitating technical aid to Member States , and for the organization of regional workshops and seminars .<-->N
There was no excuse for terrorist acts .<-->N
The Council had a duty to condemn such acts and work coherently and universally to prevent the spread of terrorism .<-->O
MOOTAZ AHMADEIN KHALIL -LRB- Egypt -RRB- , in his statement on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation -LRB- OIC -RRB- , said the OIC Group , whose members were themselves prime targets of terrorist acts , was very much aware that terrorism was one of the most serious threats to international peace and security .<-->O
He outlined four tenets he believed would improve the United Nations and Member States efforts to combat terrorism , if they were applied .<-->O
First , the evolving nature of terrorism called for effective regional and international cooperation .<-->O
Second , all terrorist acts had to be fought within a single legal concept , and should avoid double standards .<-->N
Thus , criminalizing all acts of terrorism regardless of their motivation had to be accompanied by pursuing all perpetrators of terrorist acts under due process of law , whether they were individuals , groups or States .<-->O
Third , there was need for a comprehensive approach in criminalizing incitement to terrorism ; and Security Council resolution 1624 -LRB- 2005 -RRB- was an important step in that regard .<-->O
Fourth , it was not enough to rely on security and legal measures alone to eradicate terrorism .<-->O
He believed the most effective way to fight terrorism was to eliminate its root causes .<-->O
To that end , the international community needed to work collectively towards resolving existing protracted conflicts ; recognize and fulfil the legitimate right of peoples to self determination ; and also assist the efforts of all nations towards poverty eradication .<-->O
He also noted the OIC Group s concern about the instances of intolerance , discrimination , profiling , negative stereotyping , stigmatization , religious hatred and violence against Muslims , as well as the denigration of their religion and its symbols , including the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad that occurred in many parts of the world .<-->O
Such acts contradicted international human rights norms , he declared , adding : We condone the freedom of expression that respects diversity and combats the myth of clash of civilizations ; not the one that is used to incite hatred , or to target one specific religion or culture and deepens ignorance and disregard towards the other .<-->O
At the national level , he said the best response to terrorism came with the Egyptian revolution in January 2011 , when the country proved in a practical way that change could occur by peaceful means .<-->O
The real defeat of extremist terrorist ideologies had no occurred with the use of force through Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , but rather it had happened in Tahir Square with the success of the Egyptian revolution in institutionalizing peaceful change .<-->O
ABDOU SALAM DIALLO -LRB- Senegal -RRB- said terrorism was a dangerous and complex phenomenon requiring holistic and cooperative counter-measures .<-->O
Indeed , effective and sincere international cooperation and collaboration was vital to disrupting terrorists and their networks .<-->O
Senegal , therefore , supported all activities that would bolster coordination among all States .<-->O
The Global Strategy remained the most comprehensive framework to achieve comprehensive positive results against the scourge .<-->O
The Strategy must be implemented without selectivity , including in the area of information-sharing .<-->N
In addition , the framework of legal measures adopted and enacted by the Security Council was also vital to the global combat against the scourge .<-->O
For its part , Senegal had undertaken strenuous measures to bolster its border controls and airline security , among other national measures .<-->O
Senegal remained seriously concerned by the situation in the Sahel , which made clear the ongoing and ever-changing threat posed by terrorism .<-->O
With that in mind , he welcomed the Council s recent actions to help Mali regain control of all its national territory .<-->N
Looking beyond his region , he expressed support for the Secretary-General s proposal to appoint a global counter-terrorism focal point and stressed the need for Member States to proceed swiftly towards the elaboration of a comprehensive international anti-terrorism convention .<-->O
CHRISTIAN WENAWESER -LRB- Liechtenstein -RRB- lauded the initiatives to make the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Strategy more effective and believed that a comprehensive , holistic approach was the only way to tackle terrorism sustainably .<-->O
He stressed the need to evenly implement all four pillars of the Strategy .<-->O
At the same time , it was argued that the strategy was so broad in nature that concrete progress could only be made in specific areas .<-->O
He wanted to address a few specific topics .<-->N
First , effective action to counter the financing of terrorism was a key to weaken the operational capacity of terrorists .<-->O
It was a top priority for Liechtenstein to ensure that its financial centre was not used for criminal activity .<-->O
Strong domestic legislation that required all financial intermediaries to exercise due diligence , backed by Government institutions such as financial intelligence units with the necessary resources and capabilities to follow up on reported suspicious transactions , was vital for success .<-->O
Since its inception 12 years ago , Liechtenstein s financial intelligence unit had assisted other countries in establishing and training their own units .<-->N
Further , Government responses to terrorism must adhere to applicable human rights laws and international humanitarian law , he said .<-->O
As some applicable rules of global law were rather general in nature and required that a Government s action be proportional to their goals and balance competing interests , the United Nations could do more to advise Member States how to strike a crucial balance and share best practices for doing so .<-->O
Governments must also consider to what extent extreme counter-terrorism measures could fuel more terrorist violence , or otherwise undermine the rule of law and good governance .<-->O
Also , he commended the Council s efforts to make fairer and clearer the procedures for sanctions listings related to entities associated with Al-Qaida .<-->N
The Council should apply the lessons of that process to other sanctions regime .<-->N
Finally , he stressed the need to conclude the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism .<-->O
THOMAS MAYR-HARTING , Head of the delegation of the European Union , said an integrated approach combining prevention and responses to terrorist threats and attacks was essential .<-->N
The Union worked closely with the United Nations to implement the Counter-Terrorism Strategy .<-->N
Preventing terrorism by stopping its terrorist radicalization and recruitment was a Union priority .<-->N
He called for a greater focus on addressing the conditions conducive to its spread and for new approaches involving various tools and non-traditional actors .<-->N
Efforts should include aid to victims and their families .<-->N
Victims and victims aid groups could help prevent terrorist radicalization and send a message of non-violence and reconciliation .<-->O
The Union had a range of measures aimed at cutting off terrorists access to funding .<-->N
It was committed to implementing the Financial Action Task Force s recommendations .<-->N
Relevant United Nations resolutions and Council of Europe instruments played an important role in countering terrorist financing .<-->N
Civil society , which had a key role in countering terrorism and violent extremism , must be safeguarded against abuse by terrorist networks .<-->O
Towards that end , Member States and civil society should share best practices .<-->O
Counter-terrorism must be carried out in full compliance with democratic values , human rights and the rule of law , he said .<-->O
Within the framework of the Assembly s high-level meeting in September on the rule of law , the Union pledged to develop operational guidance to ensure adherence to international humanitarian law when implementing counter-terrorism projects with third countries .<-->O
The Union would continue to support the consolidation of State institutions , the justice system , police forces and customs to strengthen security and the rule of law .<-->O
The Union welcomed the Global Counterterrorism Forum s Rule of Law Group and it would actively take part in creating in Tunis the Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law .<-->N
JULIET HAY -LRB- New Zealand -RRB- said that despite a low threat of terrorism , the Government was vigilant to possible terrorist threats in the country from disaffected or alienated members of the community .<-->O
Its coordinated national approach , carried out in consultation with the community , was rooted in prevention .<-->N
New Zealand had strengthened its legal framework to criminalize involvement in terrorism and it had created innovative social approaches to divert young people from violent extremism .<-->O
Community policing , strategies to engage minorities and religious groups , a strong focus on interfaith dialogue and initiatives fostering community trust in the National Police had helped to combat radicalization and violent extremism .<-->O
New Zealand had zero tolerance for violence or other serious crimes .<-->O
Communities were engaged to address the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour and to prevent vulnerable groups from terrorist recruitment .<-->N
That strategy had succeeded considerably in preventing terrorist acts .<-->N
New Zealand was supporting a new programme by the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate on the practical use of community policing in countering violent extremism .<-->O
Beginning this year , the programme would seek to enhance the capacity of police officers in South Asia and Southeast Asia to recognize possible extreme violence tendencies at an early stage .<-->O
New Zealand would continue partnering with the Organization s counter-terrorism entities to prevent terrorism financing through the use of cash couriers and by strengthening criminal justice and law enforcement .<-->O
SAIFUL AZAM ABDULLAH -LRB- Malaysia -RRB- aligned his statement with those of Iran s representative on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and Egypt s representative on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation .<-->N
Terrorists were comprehensive in carrying out their acts .<-->N
The international community s response must be equally comprehensive .<-->N
Terrorism s root causes must be understood and tackled through inclusive political and development efforts that fulfilled socioeconomic needs .<-->O
In short , we need to win the hearts and minds of the people to counter terrorism effectively , he said .<-->O
Human rights standards must be maintained when countering terrorism .<-->O
Towards that end , last year , Malaysia repealed the 1960 Internal Security Act and introduced the Security Offences -LRB- Special Measures -RRB- Act .<-->N
Further , while supportive of such efforts as the Alliance of Civilizations , he believed that the real problem today was not between people of different faiths , but rather between the extremists and moderates of all faiths and cultures .<-->O
Thus , he called for a Global Movement of the Moderates to drown out the voices of extremism .<-->N
Moderates must be the only dominant voice in the mainstream .<-->N
Such a move would help eradicate terrorism .<-->O
Moderation was also the best response to countering incitement to violence and extremism .<-->O
HALIT EVIK -LRB- Turkey -RRB- said that his country , like so many others , had not been spared the scourge of terrorism .<-->O
He recalled the recent attacks in Pakistan and condemned terrorism in all its forms .<-->N
He said that since terrorism was a multi-faceted phenomenon , it could only be effectively addressed through a broad spectrum of activities carried out at all levels .<-->O
We need to redouble our efforts to enhance cooperation and coordination both at the United Nations and among its Member States , as well as relevant international , regional and subregional organizations , he continued , stressing that such cooperation must lead to the identification of measures that countered the scourge of terrorism and closed off legal loopholes and implementation gaps .<-->O
Like other speakers , he stressed that law enforcement measures alone could not comprehensively counter terrorism , and said that every effort must be made to assist States in enhancing national capacity , the greatest challenge faced by many countries .<-->O
Also important was bolstering regional and subregional cooperation , as building new partnerships , enhancing institutional capacities and developing cooperative networks would have an enduring impact on collective efforts .<-->O
In addition , effective implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant Security Council resolutions also remained essential in the effort to comprehensively combat terrorism .<-->O
Finally , he stressed that continuing and enhancing the ongoing dialogue among civilizations was vital , especially towards preventing the indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures .<-->O
Broadening such dialogue could help counter the forces that fuelled polarization and extremism , he said , recalling that the Alliance of Civilizations , which had been launched by Turkey and Spain , aimed to facilitate harmony and dialogue by emphasizing common values among all cultures .<-->O
BASHAR JA AFARI -LRB- Syria -RRB- said it was a painful reality that today , terrorists struck the University of Aleppo , targeting the students as they sat for their midterm examinations .<-->N
That cowardly act killed 82 students and wounded 162 others .<-->N
Syria had constantly warned that the terrorist armed groups in his country always took advance of a Security Council meeting to perpetuate their terrorist acts , and that was indeed what had happened today perhaps for the tenth or twentieth time since the crisis in my country began .<-->O
Despite the recognition of the terrorist groups committing horrific crimes in his country , some affiliated with Al-Qaida , there were still some State policies supporting them by providing financing and offering them political and media support .<-->O
Today , armed terrorist groups also attacked homes in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood , killing and wounding the women and children there .<-->N
The Arabia channel , considered to be the operations room for such acts , actually broadcast news of that act before it actually happened and reported it as a blow by terrorist groups against the Syrian regime .<-->O
His delegation , he said , had repeatedly called on the Council for more logic and wisdom , and it had warned of the dangers of terrorists flowing into Syria , he said .<-->N
It had demanded that countries supporting those terrorist groups stop doing so , and called on the Council and others to assume their responsibilities .<-->N
However , countries with influence had thwarted any concrete action to combat terrorism in Syria , and prevented the Council from issuing even press statements that would have condemned the attacks that claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent Syrians .<-->O
The question to be asked was for whose benefit Western nations had mounted the wave of demands for legitimate reform in the Arab world , diverting those nations , forging alliance with extremist Islamist organizations , which , once in power , removed their masks and started searching for bases in countries that had not previously known such groups .<-->O
He also asked who benefited from the smuggling of Al-Qaida prisoners and detainees to Syria , with funding and support from Turkey , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and a specific political group in Lebanon .<-->O
Finally , he wondered how the Council could condemn terrorism in Mali while condoning those same attacks in Syria .<-->O
MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN -LRB- Bangladesh -RRB- called the adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in 2006 a watershed moment in the global fight against terrorism , and asked for its transparent and comprehensive implementation .<-->O
He condemned all forms of terrorism and said his Government had been following and would continue to follow a zero tolerance policy on terrorism and extremism .<-->O
Bangladesh was of the view that the four pillars of the Strategy and the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force to support its implementation were important steps .<-->O
A party to all 14 universal anti-terrorism instruments , Bangladesh also ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime .<-->N
Further , the Government supported the United Nations work in the effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1267 -LRB- 1999 -RRB- ; had banned all terrorist groups blacklisted by the 1267 Committee ; and was keeping a close eye on any suspicious activity , he stated .<-->O
He cautioned , however , that there had to be distinction between terrorism and the legitimate struggle against foreign occupation , and right to self-determination , as outlined in the Charter of the United Nations .<-->O
Any attempt to wrongfully associate terrorism with any religion , nationality , civilization or ethnic group should be avoided , he asserted .<-->O
He added that for the Global Strategy against Terrorism to succeed , its root causes , such as economic disparity and deprivation , political subjugation and exclusion , prolonged and unresolved conflicts , among others , had to be addressed in that discourse .<-->O
He called on the United Nations to lead that discourse .<-->N
MOHAMMAD KHAZAEE -LRB- Iran -RRB- , speaking as Chair of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement , said that terrorism was a common threat to the entire international community , and his delegation had long supported decisive efforts to counter that scourge whenever and wherever it was carried out .<-->O
Indeed , counter-terrorism strategies should be immune to political motivation and double standards .<-->O
They should be based on international cooperation and strengthened coordination , with the United Nations in the central role .<-->O
He said that the Movement called for a transparent , comprehensive and balanced implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy , and agreed to participate in future meetings on ensuring such implementation .<-->O
The Movement also called for enhanced engagement of member States in the work of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force , to ensure that body s transparency and provide feedback on the Strategy s implementation .<-->O
Continuing , he said that the Movement considered that terrorism could not be equated with the legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial domination or foreign occupation .<-->O
The brutalization of such peoples should continue to be denounced as the gravest form of terrorism .<-->O
The Movement also would continue to denounce the use of State power to suppress people who were exercising their inalienable right to self-determination and struggling to expel foreign occupiers .<-->O
He went on to reiterate the Movement s call for the convening of an international United Nations summit on formulating an international response to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , including identification of root causes .<-->N
It also reiterated the need to complete the elaboration of a comprehensive counter-terrorism convention .<-->O
Concluding , he said that the Movement believed that more action and political will were needed to improve existing counter-terrorism measures and initiatives , including those set up by the Security Council and the General Assembly .<-->N
Such improvements would ensure that global activities would be carried out in a coordinated , transparent , accountable and consistent manner .<-->O
DESRA PERCAYA -LRB- Indonesia -RRB- said that his country was among those that had suffered the devastating impact of terrorism and it , therefore , recognized the imperative of ensuring concerted national action against the scourge and a robust global framework that was versatile , cooperative and sustainable .<-->O
He went on to welcome the third biennial review of the Global Strategy this past June and stressed that that mechanism was a powerful tool for enhancing and coordinating worldwide anti-terrorism efforts and providing relevant assistance to Member States .<-->O
He reiterated the Non-Aligned Movement s call for enhanced engagement by member States in the work of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force , as outlined in the review process .<-->N
Such an approach would help countries better monitor and assess the work of the Task Force and to provide relevant guidance .<-->O
He went on to express his delegation s support for a comprehensive approach to counter-terrorism that encompassed human rights and the rule of law .<-->O
At the national level , Indonesia had enacted several legal measures aimed at countering terrorism , including one law that had led to the arrest , since 2003 , of some 600 terrorists .<-->N
Building on its steady progress , the country had continued to strengthen its relevant law enforcement institutions towards enhancing their capacity to deliver timely and effective results .<-->O
Through the establishment in 2010 of the National Counter-Terrorism Agency , Indonesia was addressing not only the legal and technical aspects of the scourge , but also addressing equally important social aspects , he said .<-->N
Concluding , he stressed the need to tackle the root causes of terrorism , through , among other measures , promoting dialogue , tolerance and mutual understanding , as well as through the empowerment of moderates .<-->O
Terrorism should not be associated with any culture or religion , and the international community must work to dismiss attempts to profile particular civilizations .<-->O
KAZUO KODAMA -LRB- Japan -RRB- said that more comprehensive responses were needed to prevent and eliminate international terrorism , and that it was also necessary to address all aspects of the scourge at national and global levels .<-->O
In that effort , it was necessary to consider the differing capacities and needs of specific States , including , among other situations , socio-economic conditions that could foment extremism .<-->O
He said there was also a need to promote dialogue among neighbours and regions , and to ensure the participation of civil society in all such national initiatives .<-->O
States that had been successful in achieving solid results in the area could share their experiences with others , thus contributing more broadly to capacity enhancement .<-->O
In addition to enhancing its own capacity , Japan , he said , had been conducting bilateral and multilateral dialogues and consultations .<-->N
It had been making full use of its own knowledge and contributing to international efforts by dispatching counter-terrorism experts and holding seminars , particularly in South East Asia , focusing on such issues as immigration control , aviation and maritime security , cooperation in law enforcement , and countering terrorist financing .<-->O
He went on to highlight the recent Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan and Japan s efforts to ensure the parties in the Philippines pressed ahead with the implementation of the Mindanao peace process as examples of Japan s commitment to the international effort to address all aspects of the issue .<-->O
Specifically on terrorist financing , he said that Japan welcomed that the special meeting in November of the Counter-Terrorism Committee had focused on that issue and had provided Member States and relevant organizations the opportunity to discuss experiences and challenges in that area .<-->O
Japan , for its part , was making steady progress , including through updating the measures targeting terrorist financing discussed at that meeting .<-->N
HARDEEP SINGH PURI -LRB- India -RRB- said that the scourge of terrorism undermined peace , democracy and freedom , and endangered the foundation of democratic societies .<-->O
Indeed , it was a threat that recognized no border , ethnicity or religion .<-->N
India had faced the scourge for more that two and a half decades , and the entire region had borne the brunt of the activities of the world s major terrorist actors , including , among others , Al-Qaida , Lashkar-e-Taiba , Jamaat-ud Daawa , and elements of the Taliban .<-->O
In addition , over the years , terrorists and their networks had begun to globalize , expanding both their outreach and the scope of their activities .<-->N
They recruit in one country , raise funds in another , operate in still others , and were waging asymmetric warfare against the entire international community , he said , adding that the nexus between terrorist and organized criminal networks was now well established , with terrorist financing , drug trafficking and illicit arms trading now intertwined in a complex toxic relationship .<-->O
He went on to recall that he had had the privilege to Chair the Counter-Terrorism Committee during 2011-2012 , and his delegation had aimed to provide renewed momentum to the global counter-terrorism effort and to promote a culture of zero tolerance towards the scourge .<-->O
During his delegation s chairmanship , the Committee had held three special meetings , including one that had focused on suppressing and preventing terrorist financing .<-->N
As for broader United Nations efforts , he said that India had long believed that while much progress had been made , the Organization needed to strengthen the normative framework of its Counter-Terrorism Strategy by adopting a comprehensive convention on the scourge .<-->O
The international community must also strengthen enforcement measures aimed at destroying terrorist safe havens , their financial flows and support networks .<-->O
Describing terrorism as Frankenstein s monster , he said that fighting it required unrelenting and broad-based efforts .<-->O
RON PROSOR -LRB- Israel -RRB- said that every roadside bombing , every suicide attack , and every act of terrorism began with words and thoughts of hate .<-->O
They began with Al-Qaida websites that turned suicide bombers into Jihadi celebrities .<-->N
They began with Hizbullah summer camps that used arts and crafts to glorify martyrdom and teach bomb-making skills to children .<-->O
Combating terrorism required combating terrorists wherever they struck , yet also imperative was to attack terrorist infrastructure and go after those who supported and financed terrorism .<-->O
True counter-terrorism must also begin by disrupting the ecosystem of extremism in which terror thrived .<-->O
It meant advancing education that taught peace , not hate , and mutual understanding , not martyrdom .<-->O
It meant speaking out against incitement and all forms of terrorism , even when it was politically inconvenient .<-->O
That was far from that reality , however , as in too many corners of the planet , and in this Council , some States justified certain terrorists , while condemning others .<-->O
He said Israel appreciated the work of the United Nations counter-terrorism bodies .<-->N
It continued to share its knowledge and experience through years of combating terrorism , and it was working closely with many States and regional organizations to advance counter-terrorism cooperation .<-->O
However , it takes a network to beat a network .<-->N
Criminals are supporters of terrorists , and many States , including in this Chamber , work hand in hand with them , as well .<-->N
Iran stood chief among those nations .<-->N
Across Africa , Iranian weaponry had become the tool of choice for some of the region s bloodiest insurgencies and terrorist acts .<-->F
In Gaza , Iran was funding , training and arming Hamas .<-->N
It had also help Hizbullah to build its arsenal to unprecedented levels in Lebanon .<-->N
The Council could not turn a blind eye to those States that supported and armed terrorists , who must be held accountable for the violence they had spread and the lives they had taken .<-->O
ZAHEER LAHER -LRB- South Africa -RRB- said his delegation continued to support measures that placed the United Nations at the centre of multilateral counter-terrorism efforts .<-->N
South Africa was also of the view that international initiatives must be comprehensive , including through addressing collateral concerns such as development .<-->O
He said that his Government continued to believe that the Global Strategy was the most credible and relevant international mechanism for countering terrorism which enjoyed widespread political support of all Member States .<-->O
Nevertheless , the international community must recommit to addressing the conditions that bred terrorism , and in that regard , the United Nations must step up its efforts to help resolve long-standing conflicts in accordance with international law , and to adopt strategies that limited political exclusion and social marginalization .<-->O
He said that the international community s otherwise commendable counter-terrorism measures must be carried out with due care , as well as appropriate planning and foresight .<-->O
We remain mindful that the lack of an appropriate response or political will to address long-standing conflicts will impact negatively on our collective efforts to root out terrorism , he said , noting in that regard the unintended consequences of weapons proliferation in the Sahel in the wake of actions taken by the international community in that subregion in 2011 .<-->O
The prevailing situation had given rise to a resurgence of terrorist networks , destabilizing countries in the region and making them more vulnerable to terrorism in the future .<-->N
He reiterated the need for the international community , especially the United Nations , to tackle the root causes of terrorism , as well as factors that inflamed passion and resentment , or contributed to the spread of the scourge .<-->O
JORGE VALERO BRICE O -LRB- Venezuela -RRB- restated his country s categorical condemnation of any terrorist act .<-->N
It had spearheaded efforts to counter that scourge , as demonstrated by its adherence to countless instruments and successful policies and initiatives to control the financing of terrorists and money-laundering .<-->O
In May 2012 , the organic law against organized crime and the financing of terrorism law had been enacted , with the objective of preventing , investigating , prosecuting , criminalizing and punishing those crimes .<-->O
Venezuela endorsed all steps taken within the context of the Global Strategy , which recognized that countering terrorism was the prime responsibility of Member States and should be undertaken in the context of cooperation and norms of international law and international humanitarian and human rights law .<-->O
Terrorism took many forms , but among the most reprehensible was State terrorism .<-->O
It was practised , not only by non-State actors behind the scenes , but by State actors , in the full light of day .<-->N
The Palestinian case revealed the double standard of some countries efforts to combat terrorism , and the Council s inaction in that regard was deplorable .<-->O
USMAN SARKI -LRB- Nigeria -RRB- said that the complexity and evolving nature of the threat , as well as the diversity of the conditions conducive of its spread , required a multifaceted and sustainable response at national , regional and global levels .<-->O
Terrorists exploited instability and took advantage of new technologies , including mobile telephones and the Internet .<-->N
The world had to rise to that challenge , which was why Nigeria had taken certain measures to neutralize the threats .<-->O
He drew attention to its terrorism prevention amendment bill of December 2012 , as well as to the adoption of a three-pronged strategy aimed at addressing social and economic grievances and promoting political and religious dialogue ; restructuring the banking sector and strengthening relevant institutional bodies on the front line of the fight ; and signing regional counter-terrorism treaties .<-->O
A project in the Sahel was expected to galvanize Member States , and international and civil society organizations to attain the common objective of defeating terrorism .<-->O
Nigeria was a member of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and would work within that and other frameworks to attain the common objective of blunting the dangers and threats posed by terrorist movements and organizations .<-->O
BYRGANYM AITIMOVA -LRB- Kazakhstan -RRB- said her country , convinced that no nation in the world could adequately address contemporary challenges alone , particularly those of terrorism , attached great value to cooperation on counter-terrorism , and supported all international and regional efforts in that direction , including the implementation of the main provisions of the United Nations Global Counter Terrorism Strategy at the national and regional levels .<-->O
Consequently , Kazakhstan was an active participant in the Anti-Terrorism Centre for the Commonwealth of Independent States , the regional Anti-Terrorism Structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , as well as the measures undertaken by the Organization of Collective Security treaty in the fight against terrorism and extremism .<-->O
She said her country was also undertaking counter-terrorism measures in accordance with the Individual Partnership Action Plan with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -LRB- NATO -RRB- , in addition to being engaged in ongoing dialogue and collaboration with the European Union .<-->N
The country also supported the international community s efforts to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism ; and attached great importance to international cooperation and the implementation of steps to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists .<-->O
As experience had shown that terrorism could not be prevented by force alone , it was necessary to promote sustainable economic development and education , she said .<-->O
GUILLERMO RISHCHYNSKI -LRB- Canada -RRB- said that his Government continued to recognize the obligation of all States to prevent terrorist groups from training on their territory and from crossing international boundaries to carry out operations in other States .<-->N
That principle applied equally to the Sahel , the Horn of Africa , Iran , Lebanon , the Gaza Strip and Pakistan , he said , noting that his Government had recently added the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force to its list of terrorist entities .<-->N
Canada had taken that step because that group had provided arms , funding and paramilitary training to terrorist groups such as the Taliban , Hamas , Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command , among others .<-->N
Indeed , dubious networks thriving in ungoverned spaces , at the confluence of State and non-State actors , must be confronted for what they are , wherever they aspire to accomplish hegemonic ambitions , he said .<-->O
The ongoing threat of terrorism compelled all countries to work more closely together , united in purpose and coordinated in practice , to combat radical sectarianism , which manifested in the lives of the innocent through acts of unmitigated terror .<-->O
To that end , he said that the Global Strategy was a valuable tool for combating international terrorism , and noted that Canada had participated in the review of that mechanism last year and continued to serve in its role as facilitator of the General Assembly s annual resolution on measures to eliminate international terrorism .<-->O
He went on to note that Canada had launched a national counter-terrorism road map last year , aiming , among others , to prevent individuals from participating in terrorism and denying terrorists the means and opportunity to carry out their activities .<-->N
Combating terrorist financing was another key aspect of Canada s national approach , as was responding to the needs of victims of terrorism .<-->O
Specifically on that matter , he said that through a recently introduced act , Canada was providing victims with the means to seek justice by holding perpetrators and those who supported them , including the States , accountable for their actions .<-->O
ARTHUR KAFEERO -LRB- Uganda -RRB- recalled that in July 2010 , his country had been targeted by a cowardly attack perpetrated by Al-Shabaab , resulting in the deaths of some 78 people and the wounding of some 200 others .<-->N
Uganda continued to face threats from Al-Shabaab and other groups , such as the Lord s Resistance Army and the Allied Democratic Forces , all of which shared links to Al-Qaida .<-->N
Condemning all forms of terrorism , he said that Uganda supported the full implementation of the Global Strategy .<-->N
The Government had also adopted regional and national measures aimed at preventing the scourge .<-->N
In that regard , Uganda had strengthened its relevant cooperation through frameworks such as the East African Community , the Intergovernmental Authority for Development -LRB- IGAD -RRB- and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region .<-->O
Turning to the increased level of sophistication of terrorist networks and the strong , clear links of such networks to other organized criminal enterprises , he said that it was necessary for the United Nations to support implementation of counter-terrorism strategies that served the mutually supporting and symbiotic relationships between the two .<-->O
Our collective efforts should aim at denying terrorists any havens , eradicating sources of terrorist financing , reducing State vulnerabilities and enhancing preparedness and response capabilities , he said .<-->N
By way of conclusion , he stressed that priority attention should be given to preventing terrorist acts , through the implementation of a comprehensive approach that addressed such fundamental vulnerabilities as economic depravation and weak State structures .<-->O
Such comprehensive actions would deprive terrorists of their recruiting grounds and improve the ability of States to counter the activities of terrorist actors .<-->O
GAREN NAZARIAN -LRB- Armenia -RRB- said that the enormous threat of terrorism and its implications required the coordinated action and support of various United Nations counter-terrorism bodies and those of other intergovernmental agencies dealing with transnational crimes .<-->O
Armenia had developed effective multilateral cooperation in the fight against transnational crime and international terrorism , in such areas as legal reforms , improved law enforcement capacity , border control and intelligence .<-->O
Unilaterally , it had adopted practical and effective border control measures and demonstrated a strong interest in acquiring more such technology .<-->O
But , the close borders with some of its neighbours in a very sensitive area discouraged cooperation .<-->O
The conflict in the South Caucasus was unresolved , but it was no excuse for the accumulation of enormous amounts of weapons , often in violation of international treaties , he said .<-->O
Further , terrorism should not be equated with the legitimate struggle for self-determination , and he condemned the use of State power and mercenaries to suppress that inalienable right .<-->O
Given that conditions conducive to the spread of international crime included , among others , prolonged conflicts , awareness programmes were vital ; dissemination and broadcast of hate speeches at the State level incited terrorism , and must be replaced by tolerance and dialogue .<-->O
ZAHIR TANIN -LRB- Afghanistan -RRB- said his country had lived with terrorism for more than two decades .<-->N
It was not too long ago that Al-Qaida and affiliated groups used the territory , not only as a site for brutal attacks against the Afghan people , but as a staging ground for terrorist attacks around the world .<-->O
Since the fall of the Taliban 11 years ago , Afghanistan had made important headway , but despite that progress , terrorism and insecurity remained serious challenges .<-->O
The country s counter-terrorism approach , central to its national strategy , was being carried out by national security institutions .<-->N
Operationally , scores of terrorists and enemy combatants had been captured and brought to justice .<-->N
Through intelligence gathering , hundreds of terrorist plots in various parts of the country had been subverted .<-->N
Operating with increased capability , the security forces were increasingly taking charge of combat operations nationwide , including counter-terrorism operations , he said .<-->O
Insecurity and terrorism not only threatened Afghanistan , but the wider region and , with Pakistan , his country had enhanced cooperation in several areas .<-->O
It was also party to 13 international counter-terrorism conventions and protocols and relevant ministries , and Government agencies were working closely to implement national legislation .<-->N
FERNANDO ARIAS -LRB- Spain -RRB- said that terrorism must be condemned firmly and completely , and no justification of any kind must be accepted .<-->O
Combating it required cooperation from the police and the courts .<-->N
However , the economic and social circumstances in certain parts of the world created fertile ground for violent radicalization .<-->O
That required the development of new strategies , which explored the link between security and development .<-->N
What was occurring in Mali was a good example of what happened when citizens did not find a framework of security and development .<-->N
Prevention required the development of inter-cultural dialogue and a fight against fanaticism .<-->O
The Global Strategy must evolve and include responsible interaction between local communities and police forces , and grant special attention to social integration at the local level .<-->O
Spain was distributing educational material in schools to help develop pluralism and believed it was also necessary to spread messages throughout the Internet that discredit terrorism and that strip away the glorious and generous image , which is presented in many forums .<-->O
CHARLES NTWAAGAE -LRB- Botswana -RRB- , aligning himself with the statement of the Non-Aligned Movement , said his country joined the international community in condemning acts of terrorism in all their forms and manifestations wherever , however and whenever their occurred .<-->N
The fact that terrorism was a violent form of transnational crime that thrived on proceeds of crime , ranging from illegal trade to money-laundering , meant that the common resolve of the international community was needed to provide an effective global response and action .<-->O
Therefore , Botswana believed that the international community needed to move a step higher in its concerted efforts against acts of terrorism , and consolidate all the existing 13 multilateral conventions and protocols in order to intensify and harmonize action against the scourge .<-->O
Above all , it was important to strengthen the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy .<-->N
Botswana also believed that development of strong institutions of governance , promotion of the rule of law , and the promotion and protection of human rights served as a useful foundation for countering terrorism .<-->O
At the national level , the country had established a National Counter-Terrorism Committee with the mandate of ensuring implementation of counter-terrorism strategies , he explained .<-->N
In that regard , there had been steady progress in legislative reforms and strengthening the capability of the security apparatus to combat terrorism .<-->O
They included the drafting of a comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation to deal with the threat of terrorism , the creation of new institutions , such as the Directorate on Intelligence and Security , the Financial Intelligence Agency and the Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority .<-->O
Multilaterally , the country continued to intensify collaboration and cooperation in the fight against terrorism at the subregional , regional and international levels .<-->O
THOMAS GURBER -LRB- Switzerland -RRB- expressed condolences to the victims of the recent attacks in Pakistan , and of our terrorist attacks worldwide .<-->N
He condemned terrorism and rejected any association to race , ethnicity , civilization , nationality or religion .<-->N
He subscribed fully to a comprehensive approach to combat it , which was best reflected in the Organization s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy .<-->O
Creation of a United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator in the near future would enable the Strategy s system-wide implementation .<-->N
Switzerland s national Counter-Terrorism Coordinator at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs chaired an Interdepartmental Group on Counter-Terrorism involving more than 30 agencies .<-->N
Since its launch in 2007 , the International Process on Global Counter-Terrorism Cooperation , to which Switzerland was a member , had held several global and regional meetings .<-->N
Together , with the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force , the Process was planning another meeting of global counter-terrorism focal points in Geneva in June with a special focus on the conditions conducive to terrorism s spread and regional cooperation to better understand what motivated terrorists .<-->O
However , Government efforts alone could not prevent and end terrorism .<-->N
As the threat became more diffuse , civil society should be better integrated into those efforts , including academia , religious organizations and others .<-->O
For example , they could be relevant in kidnapping for ransom situations , when paying a ransom was not an option for the Government .<-->N
Civil society actors could play a significant role in preventing and countering kidnappings for ransom and for ensuring the safe release of hostages .<-->O
GEIR PEDERSEN -LRB- Norway -RRB- , speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries , said preventing terrorism required a comprehensive political , economic , legal and military approach with short-term and long-term measures .<-->N
Respect for human rights and the rule of law was the starting point .<-->N
In that regard , it was vital to strengthen the capacities of the judiciary , police and border control .<-->O
He lauded the 30-month extension of the mandate of the Ombudsperson for the Al-Qaida sanctions system and encouraged all Member States to fully support his Office .<-->O
The Nordic countries had made voluntary contributions through the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force , CTED , United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime -LRB- UNODC -RRB- and other United Nations entities to help Member States counter the scourge .<-->O
He called for further efficiency and avoiding overlap , as well as improving coordination with the Global Initiative to Counter Nuclear Terrorism .<-->O
He welcomed the proposal to appoint a United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator .<-->N
He supported the close cooperation between CTED and the Financial Action Task Force to prevent terrorism financing .<-->O
He urged all Member States to implement the Task Force s practical recommendations .<-->N
States must clearly state the scope and applicability of counter-terrorism laws and measures , so they did not undermine access for humanitarian aid and actors .<-->O
MOHAMED KHIARI -LRB- Tunisia -RRB- reaffirmed his delegation s condemnation of all forms of terrorism and its commitment to comprehensive efforts to combat the scourge in line with international law .<-->O
Tunisia continued to face threats posed by terrorism and was seriously concerned by the activities of terrorists and terrorist networks operating in the Sahel and other regions .<-->O
Tunisia was committed to national counter-terrorism measures and it had also acceded to international treaties and continued to shoulder its responsibilities under the Global Strategy .<-->N
He said that his Government was committed to ensuring that all efforts aimed at combating terrorism adhered to international human rights law .<-->N
The scourge was not associated with certain groups or religions and , indeed , it affected all nations and people .<-->O
Tunisia was committed to ensuring that the architecture of the United Nations was strengthened and enhanced , especially those that could help bolster national capacities to combat terrorist financing and the use of new information communication technologies by terrorists .<-->O
A comprehensive approach to countering terrorism must include the participation of all actors .<-->O
FERNANDO ALZATE -LRB- Columbia -RRB- said terrorism was a threat to international peace and security and all States must , therefore , strengthen their efforts to combat it in a coordinated manner .<-->O
Colombia continued to stress that there was no justification for terrorism and appealed to Member States to ensure effective implementation of the global measures that had been agreed to prevent and eradicate the scourge .<-->O
The General Assembly must be the central norm-setting body in the area , while the Security Council and its subsidiary organs must continue efforts in the legal sphere .<-->O
Overall , the pillars of the Global Strategy must be implemented and all such measures must be based on the rule of law and human rights .<-->O
The United Nations must facilitate national capacity-building , he said , adding that Member States must also ensure that countries had in place proper mechanisms to provide assistance to victims of terrorism .<-->O
Continuing , he said that disrupting terrorist financing was a major element of the overall global effort to prevent and eradicate terrorism .<-->O
He said that Colombia continued to do its part , and at the end of the month , it would host a conference aimed at assisting countries in building their national capacities .<-->N
Colombia would also continue to work multilaterally and bilaterally to ensure that the international community implemented a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy .<-->O
PALITHA KOHONA -LRB- Sri Lanka -RRB- said the Organization must grapple with terrorism and aim to end or dramatically lessen the human suffering and misery it caused .<-->O
Sri Lanka served as Chair of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism , which aimed to conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism .<-->N
Sri Lanka was a party to several global conventions aimed at suppressing terrorism ; had taken legislative steps to suppress terrorism ; and was committed to the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy .<-->O
It had formed mutual legal assistance agreements with Pakistan , Thailand and Hong Kong .<-->N
It was a party to the Regional Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism and the Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation -LRB- SAARC -RRB- .<-->F
It trained law enforcement and judicial officers at home in intelligence and information sharing , investigation , and analysis , and partnered with the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate on a training workshop in Colombo .<-->N
A victim of terrorism for almost three decades , Sri Lanka learned early the value of confronting terrorism s links to international trafficking , money-laundering , weapons smuggling and cyber crime networks , he said .<-->O
It had worked closely with Australia to address human smuggling .<-->N
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam terrorists had received ready funding from sympathizers abroad and coerced terrified civilians to contribute to their cause .<-->N
Even during Sri Lanka s post-conflict phase , pre-existing networks in transit and developing countries continued to exploit human misery .<-->O
Prosecution of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam fundraisers and arms procurers continued .<-->N
Since the conflict ended , Sri Lanka had focused on rehabilitation , reconstruction , reintegration and reconciliation .<-->O
It had re-established democratic processes and held local Government elections in former conflict areas , as well as set up a Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission .<-->O
More than 11,000 former combatants had been rehabilitated and allowed to return home .<-->N
RODOLFO REYES RODRIGUEZ -LRB- Cuba -RRB- said his Government condemned all forms of terrorism and likewise condemned any actions aimed at encouraging , supporting , financing or concealing any act , method or practice of the scourge .<-->O
Cuba had an impeccable record when it came to combating terrorism ; it had never , nor would it ever , allow its territory to be used to carry out , mastermind or finance terrorist acts against any country .<-->O
He said that Cuba had adopted and implemented legislative , administrative and institutional measures aimed at preventing and suppressing terrorist activities .<-->N
Such legislation had also enhanced border protection and surveillance , judicial cooperation and State-level adherence to international anti-terrorism legal instruments .<-->O
He said the international community must not accept that certain States committed acts of aggression and interference in the internal affairs of other States under the pretext of an alleged fight against terrorism .<-->O
Neither should the international community accept that certain States carried out unilateral acts that contravened the Charter of the United Nations , as well as the principles of international law .<-->O
He said that Cuba had been a victim of terrorism and some 3,400 people had been killed over the past half century , most through actions that had been organized and financed by the United States and carried out from within that country s territory .<-->N
In addition , he said that Cuba reiterated its denunciation of the most notorious terrorist in the Western hemisphere , Luis Posada Carriles , who walked freely in the United States under the protection of that country s Government .<-->O
Yet , at the same time , the United States continued to hold against their will five innocent Cuban anti-terrorist fighters .<-->O
He reiterated his country s demand for the release of those five , who had only been seeking to obtain information on terrorist groups operating in Miami .<-->O
YOUSSOUFOU BAMBA -LRB- C te d Ivoire -RRB- , speaking on behalf of the Economic Community of West African States -LRB- ECOWAS -RRB- , said the terrorism in the continent was most active in West Africa and the Sahel .<-->O
Identifying a global approach to counter terrorism was the foremost concern of ECOWAS member States .<-->O
Since the start of the crisis in Mali last year , ECOWAS had drawn the international community s attention to the threat to regional and international peace and security posed by terrorist groups in that country .<-->O
It was pleased at the adoption of resolution 2085 -LRB- 2012 -RRB- , which authorized the deployment of the African-led international support mission to Mali .<-->O
Everyone knew that the intent of terrorists in Mali was to turn that vast territory into a safe haven for terrorist groups and organized crime and to use it to recruit , train and launch operations across the world and then withdraw in total impunity .<-->O
The most recent attacks in southern Mali last week posed a direct , genuine and immediate threat to regional and international peace and security , and were an imminent danger to Mali s territorial integrity .<-->O
ECOWAS leaders would convene an urgent meeting on 19 January .<-->N
France s intervention was absolutely legitimate as it was in response to an explicit request for assistance and was in line with resolution 2085 , he added .<-->O
ABDALLAH AL-MOUALLIMI -LRB- Saudi Arabia -RRB- said his country was a leader in the fight against terrorism .<-->O
Saudi Arabia had acceded to 14 regional and global agreements and conventions to counter terrorism and financing for it , and had implemented the assets freeze and travel ban imposed by Council resolutions , as well as the arms embargo against persons on the consolidated list of the Council s sanctions committee .<-->O
It cooperated closely with other countries to combat terrorism , especially through the sanctions committees for Al-Qaida and the Taliban .<-->N
Last year , Saudi Arabia gave $ 500,000 to support the work of the Council s Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1540 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- to control and prevent the use of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons and their delivery to non-State actors .<-->N
Saudi Arabia s support for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre in Riyadh illustrated its commitment to collective actions and to preserving global peace and security .<-->O
He called on the international community to cooperate with the Centre .<-->N
Saudi Arabia had taken several important national steps and security safeguards to combat and limit terrorism , such as establishing new security departments specialized in counter-terrorism ; enacting and amending laws to combat it ; and tightening restrictions on the manufacture , possession and sale of weapons .<-->O
It had also tightened border controls to prevent the infiltration of terrorists and weapons smuggling .<-->N
It also set up a rehabilitation centre to counsel repentant terrorists and reintegrated them into society , which had become a role model for eradicating terrorism s root causes and its ideology .<-->N
It was vital to eradicate terrorism s causes , namely occupation , oppression , ethnic cleansing and depriving people of their right to self-determination .<-->O
The acts of the Palestinian people and others under occupation could not be classified as terrorism , as they were a form of self-defence against systematic State terrorism .<-->O
Additional Statements Taking the floor a second time , the representative of Turkey said his delegation wished to refute unfounded statements and accusations made against his country by one delegation .<-->O
Turkey would categorically reject those statements and would continue to stand by the Syrian people , who must be the masters of their own future .<-->O
Also taking the floor , the representative of Iran said that the delegations representing both the Israeli regime and Canada had separately made some unfounded accusations against his country .<-->O
As for the Zionist regime , which was responsible for so many reprehensible crimes , Iran would not try the Council s patience by enumerating them .<-->O
That regime s cyber attacks against Iran and its assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist were but two examples .<-->N
As for Canada , he categorically rejected that representative s malicious allegations against the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution , an important segment of the Iranian defence forces .<-->O
It was a pity that Canada , through its narrow-minded policies , had again used the Council as a forum to air its national concerns .<-->O
Iran was a victim of terrorism and some of the main perpetrators of those heinous acts against Iran with their hands saturated with the blood of thousands of innocent Iranians were hiding in Canada .<-->O
Canada itself was hiding , internationally and within the Security Council , to obscure its policies .<-->N
Presidential Statement The Council then adopted the presidential statement -LRB- S/PRST/2012 / 1 -RRB- , the full text of which reads as follows : The Security Council reaffirms its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations .<-->O
The Security Council notes with deep concern that terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security , recalls all its resolutions and statements on counter-terrorism , reiterates its strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , committed by whomever , wherever and for whatever purposes , and expresses its determination to combat by all means terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law , including applicable international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law .<-->O
The Security Council stresses that any terrorist acts are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation .<-->O
The Security Council stresses that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States and international and regional organizations to impede , impair , isolate and incapacitate the terrorist threat .<-->O
The Security Council recognizes that terrorism will not be defeated by military force or security forces , law enforcement measures , and intelligence operations alone , and underlines the need to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism , including , but not limited to , strengthening efforts for the successful prevention and peaceful resolution of prolonged conflicts , and also promoting the rule of law , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , good governance , tolerance and inclusiveness .<-->O
The Security Council stresses the importance of the continued implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in an integrated and balanced manner and in all its aspects and takes note of the third review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by the General Assembly in 2012 .<-->N

------------------------------------------------------------ Terrorism First published Mon Oct 22 , 2007 ; substantive revision Mon Feb 23 , 2015 Before the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 , the subject of terrorism did not loom large in philosophical discussion .<-->O
Philosophical literature in English amounted to a few monographs and a single collection of papers devoted solely , or largely , to questions to do with terrorism .<-->O
Articles on the subject in philosophy journals were few and far between ; neither of the two major philosophy encyclopedias had an entry .<-->N
The attacks of September 11 and their aftermath put terrorism on the philosophical agenda : it is now the topic of numerous books , journal articles , special journal issues , and conferences .<-->N
While social sciences study the causes , main varieties , and consequences of terrorism and history traces and attempts to explain the way terrorism has evolved over time , philosophy focuses on two fundamental and related questions .<-->O
The first is conceptual : What is terrorism ?<-->N
The second is moral : Can terrorism ever be morally justified ?<-->N
Philosophers have offered a range of positions on both questions .<-->N
With regard to the problem of defining terrorism , the dominant approach seeks to acknowledge the core meaning terrorism has in common use .<-->O
Terrorism is understood as a type of violence .<-->N
Many definitions highlight the experience of terror or fear as the proximate aim of that violence .<-->O
Neither violence nor terror is inflicted for its own sake , but rather for the sake of a further aim such as coercion , or some more specific political objective .<-->O
But there are also definitions that sever the conceptual connection of terrorism with violence or with terror .<-->O
With regard to the moral standing of terrorism , philosophers differ both on how that is to be determined and what the determination is .<-->O
Consequentialists propose to judge terrorism , like everything else , in light of its consequences .<-->O
Nonconsequentialists argue that its moral status is not simply a matter of what consequences , on balance , terrorism has , but is rather determined , whether solely or largely , by what it is .<-->O
Positions on the morality of terrorism range from justification when its consequences on balance are good , or when some deontological moral requirements are satisfied , to its absolute , or almost absolute , rejection .<-->O
Philosophers working in applied philosophy have also sought to complement the discussions of terrorism in general with case studies studies of the role and rights and wrongs of terrorism in particular conflicts , such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland -LRB- George 2000 ; Simpson 2004 ; Shanahan 2009 -RRB- , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -LRB- Gordon and Lopez 2000 ; Primoratz 2006 ; Kapitan 2008 ; Law -LRB- ed . -RRB-<-->O
, 2008 -RRB- , and the bombing of German cities in World War II -LRB- Grayling 2006 , Primoratz 2010 -RRB- .<-->N

The conceptual issue The history of terrorism is probably coextensive with the history of political violence .<-->N
The term terrorism , however , is relatively recent : it has been in use since late 18th century .<-->N
Its use has repeatedly shifted in some significant respects .<-->N
Moreover , in contemporary political discourse the word is often employed as a polemical term whose strong emotional charge occludes its somewhat vague descriptive meaning .<-->O
All this tends to get in the way of sustained rational discussion of the nature and moral standing of terrorism and the best ways of coping with it .<-->O
1.1 Terrorism from the French Revolution to the early 21st century 1.1.1 The reign of terror When it first entered public discourse in the West , the word terrorism meant the reign of terror the Jacobins imposed in France from the fall of 1793 to the summer of 1794 .<-->O
Its ultimate aim was the reshaping of both society and human nature .<-->N
That was to be achieved by destroying the old regime , suppressing all enemies of the revolutionary government , and inculcating and enforcing civic virtue .<-->N
A central role in attaining these objectives was accorded to revolutionary tribunals which had wide authority , were constrained by very few rules of procedure , and saw their task as carrying out revolutionary policy rather than meting out legal justice of the more conventional sort .<-->O
They went after enemies of the people , actual or potential , proven or suspected ; the law on the basis of which they were operating enumerated just who the enemies of the people might be in terms so ambiguous as to exclude no one -LRB- Carter 1989 : 142 -RRB- .<-->O
The standard punishment was death .<-->N
Trials and executions were meant to strike terror in the hearts of all who lacked civic virtue ; the Jacobins believed that was a necessary means of consolidating the new regime .<-->O
This necessity provided both the rationale of the reign of terror and its moral justification .<-->O
As Robespierre put it , terror was but an emanation of virtue ; without it , virtue remained impotent .<-->O
Accordingly , the Jacobins applied the term to their own actions and policies quite unabashedly , without any negative connotations .<-->O
1.1.2 Propaganda by the deed Yet the term terrorism and its cognates soon took on very strong negative connotations .<-->O
Critics of the excesses of the French Revolution had watched its reign with horror from the start .<-->N
Terrorism came to be associated with drastic abuse of power and related to the notion of tyranny as rule based on fear , a recurring theme in political philosophy .<-->O
In the second half of the 19th century , there was a shift in both descriptive and evaluative meaning of the term .<-->N
Disillusioned with other methods of political struggle , some anarchist and other revolutionary organizations , and subsequently some nationalist groups too , took to political violence .<-->O
They had come to the conclusion that words were not enough , and what was called for were deeds : extreme , dramatic deeds that would strike at the heart of the unjust , oppressive social and political order , generate fear and despair among its supporters , demonstrate its vulnerability to the oppressed , and ultimately force political and social change .<-->O
This was propaganda by the deed , and the deed was for the most part assassination of royalty or highly placed government officials .<-->N
Unlike the Jacobins ' reign of terror , which operated in a virtually indiscriminate way , this type of terrorism as both advocates and critics called it was largely employed in a highly discriminate manner .<-->O
This was especially true of Russian revolutionary organizations such as People 's Will or Socialist Revolutionary Party -LRB- SR -RRB- : they held that it was morally justified to assassinate a government official only if his complicity in the oppressive regime was significant enough for him to deserve to die , and the assassination would make an important contribution to the struggle .<-->O
Their violence steered clear of other , uninvolved or insufficiently involved persons .<-->N
Some instances of propaganda by the deed carried out by French and Spanish anarchists in the 1880s and 1890s were indiscriminate killings of common citizens ; but that was an exception , rather than the rule .<-->O
The perpetrators and some of those sympathetic to their cause claimed those acts were nevertheless morally legitimate , whether as retribution -LRB- exacted on the assumption that no member of the ruling class was innocent -RRB- or as a means necessary for the overthrow of the unjust order .<-->O
Accordingly , in their parlance , too , the term terrorism implied no censure .<-->O
When used by others , it conveyed a strong condemnation of the practice .<-->N
1.1.3 The state as terrorist The terrorism employed by both sides in the Russian Revolution and Civil War was in important respects a throwback to that of the Jacobins .<-->N
The government set up in Russia by the victorious Bolsheviks was totalitarian .<-->N
So was the Nazi rule in Germany .<-->N
Both sought to impose total political control on society .<-->N
Such a radical aim could only be pursued by a similarly radical method : by terrorism directed by an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and defenseless population .<-->O
Its success was due largely to its arbitrary character to the unpredictability of its choice of victims .<-->O
In both countries , the regime first suppressed all opposition ; when it no longer had any opposition to speak of , political police took to persecuting potential and objective opponents .<-->O
In the Soviet Union , it was eventually unleashed on victims chosen at random .<-->N
Totalitarian terrorism is the most extreme and sustained type of state terrorism .<-->O
As Hannah Arendt put it , terror is the essence of totalitarian domination , and the concentration camp is the true central institution of totalitarian organizational power -LRB- Arendt 1958 : 464 , 438 -RRB- .<-->O
While students of totalitarianism talked of terrorism as its method of rule , representatives of totalitarian regimes , sensitive to the pejorative connotation of the word , portrayed the practice as defense of the state from internal enemies .<-->O
However , state terrorism is not the preserve of totalitarian regimes .<-->N
Some non-totalitarian states have resorted to terrorism against enemy civilians as a method of warfare , most notably when the RAF and USAAF bombed German and Japanese cities in World War II -LRB- see Lackey 2004 -RRB- .<-->O
Those who designed and oversaw these campaigns never publicly described them as terror bombing , but that was how they often referred to them in internal communications .<-->N
1.1.4 Terrorists and freedom fighters After the heyday of totalitarian terrorism in the 1930s and 1940s , internal state terrorism continued to be practiced by military dictatorships in many parts of the world , albeit in a less sustained and pervasive way .<-->O
But the type of terrorism that came to the fore in the second half of the 20th century and in early 21st century is that employed by insurgent organizations .<-->N
Many movements for national liberation from colonial rule resorted to it , either as the main method of struggle or as a tactic complementing guerrilla warfare .<-->O
So did some separatist movements .<-->N
Some organizations driven by extreme ideologies , in particular on the left , took to terrorism as the way of trying to destroy what they considered an unjust , oppressive economic , social and political system .<-->O
This type of terrorism is , by and large , indiscriminate in its choice of target : it attacks men and women of whatever political -LRB- or apolitical -RRB- views , social class , and walk of life ; young and old , adults and children .<-->O
It shoots at people , or blows them up by planting bombs , in office buildings , markets , cafes , cinemas , places of religious worship , on buses or planes , or in other vulnerable public places .<-->N
It also takes people hostage , by hijacking planes and in other ways .<-->N
As terrorism has by now acquired a very strong pejorative meaning , no-one applies the word to their own actions or to actions and campaigns of those they sympathize with .<-->O
Insurgents practicing terrorism portray their actions as struggle for liberation and seek to be considered and treated as soldiers rather than terrorists or criminals .<-->O
They often depict their enemy the alien government , or the agencies of the social , political and economic system as the true terrorists .<-->N
For them , the test of terrorism is not what is done , but rather what the ultimate aim of doing it is .<-->O
If the ultimate aim is liberation or justice , the violence used in order to attain it is not terrorism , whereas the violence aiming at maintaining oppression or injustice , or some of the structural violence embodying it , is .<-->O
On the other hand , governments tend to paint all insurgent violence with the brush of terrorism .<-->N
Government spokespersons and pro-government media typically assume that terrorism is by definition something done by non-state agents , and that a state can never be guilty of terrorism -LRB- although it can sponsor terrorist organizations -RRB- .<-->O
For them , the test of terrorism is not what is done , but who does it .<-->N
When a state agency uses violence , it is an act of war , or reprisal , or defense of the security of the state and its citizens ; when an insurgent group does the same , it is terrorism .<-->O
Under these circumstances , one person 's terrorist is indeed another 's freedom fighter , and public debate about terrorism is largely conducted at cross purposes and to little effect .<-->O
Attempts of the United Nations to propose a definition of terrorism that could be accepted by all states and embedded in international law so far have been frustrated by the same sort of relativism .<-->O
Islamic countries would accept no definition that allowed national liberation movements in the Middle East and Kashmir to be portrayed as terrorist , whereas Western countries would accept no definition that allowed for state agencies to be guilty of terrorism .<-->O
1.2 Two core traits of terrorism and two types of definition 1.2.1 Violence and terror The evaluative meaning of terrorism has shifted considerably more than once .<-->O
So has its descriptive meaning , but to a lesser degree .<-->N
Whatever else the word may have meant , its ordinary use over more than two centuries has typically indicated two things : violence and intimidation -LRB- the causing of great fear or terror , terrorizing -RRB- .<-->O
The dominant approach to the conceptual question in philosophical literature reflects this .<-->N
Terrorism is usually understood as a type of violence .<-->N
This violence is not blind or sadistic , but rather aims at intimidation and at some further political , social , or religious goal or , more broadly , at coercion .<-->O
That is how -LRB- political -RRB- terrorism is defined by Per Bauhn in the first philosophical book-length study in English : The performance of violent acts , directed against one or more persons , intended by the performing agent to intimidate one or more persons and thereby to bring about one or more of the agent 's political goals -LRB- Bauhn 1989 : 28 -RRB- .<-->O
Another good example of a mainstream definition is provided in C.A.J. Coady 's article on terrorism in the Encyclopedia of Ethics : The tactic of intentionally targeting non-combatants -LSB- or non-combatant property , when significantly related to life and security -RSB- with lethal or severe violence meant to produce political results via the creation of fear -LRB- Coady 2001 : 1697 -RRB- .<-->O
Yet another example is the definition proposed by Igor Primoratz : The deliberate use of violence , or threat of its use , against innocent people , with the aim of intimidating some other people into a course of action they otherwise would not take -LRB- Primoratz 2013 : 24 -RRB- .<-->O
These definitions put aside both the question of who the actor is and the question of what their ultimate objectives are , and focus on what is done and what the proximate aim of doing it is .<-->N
They present terrorism as a way of acting that could be adopted by different agents and serve various ultimate objectives -LRB- most , but perhaps not all of them , political -RRB- .<-->O
It can be employed by states or by non-state agents , and may promote national liberation or oppression , revolutionary or conservative causes -LRB- and possibly pursue some nonpolitical aims as well -RRB- .<-->O
One can be a terrorist and a freedom fighter ; terrorism is not the monopoly of enemies of freedom .<-->O
One can hold high government or military office and design or implement a terrorist campaign ; terrorism is not the preserve of insurgents .<-->N
In this way much of the relativism concerning who is and who is not a terrorist that has plagued contemporary public debate -LRB- see 1.1.4 above -RRB- can be overcome .<-->O
Beyond concurring that violence and intimidation constitute the core of terrorism , the definitions quoted above differ in several respects .<-->O
Does only actual violence count , or do threats of violence also qualify ?<-->O
Must terrorist violence be directed against life and limb , or does violence against -LRB- some -RRB- property also count ?<-->N
Does terrorism always seek to attain some political goal , or can there be non-political -LRB- e.g. criminal -RRB- terrorism ?<-->O
All these points are minor .<-->N
There is also one major difference : while Coady and Primoratz define terrorism as violence against non-combatants or innocent people , respectively , Bauhn 's definition includes no such restriction .<-->O
Definitions of the former type can be termed narrow , and those of the latter sort wide .<-->N
Philosophical literature on terrorism abounds in instances of both types .<-->N
1.2.2 Wide and narrow definitions Should we adopt a wide or a narrow definition ?<-->O
A wide definition encompasses the entire history of terrorism from the Jacobins to the present , and is more in accord with current ordinary use .<-->O
A narrow definition departs from much ordinary use by restricting terrorist violence to that directed at non-combatants or innocent persons .<-->O
Thus it leaves out most of 19th century propaganda by the deed and political violence perpetrated by Russian revolutionaries which they themselves and the public called terrorist .<-->N
For these reasons , historians of terrorism normally work with a wide definition , and social scientists do so much of the time .<-->O
But philosophers may well prefer a narrow definition .<-->O
They focus on the moral standing of terrorism and need a definition that is particularly helpful in moral discourse .<-->O
Morally speaking , surely there is a difference for some , a world of difference between planting a bomb in a government building and killing a number of highly placed officials of -LRB- what one considers -RRB- an unjust and oppressive government , and planting a bomb in a tea shop and killing a random collection of common citizens , including children .<-->O
While both acts raise serious moral issues , these issues are not identical , and running them together under the same heading of terrorism will likely hamper , rather than help , discerning moral assessment .<-->O
Narrow definitions are revisionary , but -LRB- unlike those discussed in the next section -RRB- not implausibly so .<-->N
They focus on the traits of terrorism that cause most of us to view the practice with deep moral repugnance : -LRB- i -RRB- violence -LRB- ii -RRB- against non-combatants -LRB- or , alternatively , against innocent people -RRB- for the sake of -LRB- iii -RRB- intimidation -LRB- and , on some definitions , -LRB- iv -RRB- coercion -RRB- .<-->O
In highlighting -LRB- ii -RRB- , they relate the issue of terrorism to the ethics of war and one of the fundamental principles of just war theory , that of non-combatant immunity .<-->O
They help distinguish terrorism from acts of war proper and political assassination , which do not target non-combatants or common citizens .<-->O
It does not matter very much whether the victims of terrorism are described as non-combatants or innocent people , as each term is used in a technical sense , and both refer to those who have not lost their immunity against lethal or other extreme violence by being directly involved in , or highly responsible for , -LRB- what terrorists consider -RRB- insufferable injustice or oppression .<-->O
In war , these are innocent civilians ; in a violent conflict that falls short of war , these are common citizens .<-->O
Is the injustice or oppression at issue , and thus the standing of those implicated in it , to be determined by some objective criteria , or from the point of view of those who resort to violence ?<-->O
Coady chooses the former option .<-->N
He approaches terrorism from the standpoint of just war theory and its principle of noncombatant immunity .<-->O
Combatants is a technical term designating agents of aggression or , more broadly , dangerous wrongdoers or agents of harm ; they are legitimate targets of potentially lethal violence .<-->O
All others are noncombatants , and enjoy immunity from such violence -LRB- Coady 2004 -RRB- .<-->N
This approach may not be difficult to apply in war , where the wrong or harm at issue is either aggression that needs to be repelled , or systematic and large-scale violations of human rights that provide the ground for humanitarian intervention .<-->O
Issues of injustice or oppression that arise in an internal conflict that falls short of war , however , tend to be highly contentious : what some consider an imperfect , but basically morally legitimate political and social order , others may see as the epitome of injustice and oppression that must be overthrown , if need be by violence .<-->O
Under such circumstances , when a highly placed political official is killed by insurgents , that may be characterized -LRB- and condemned -RRB- by many as an act of terrorism , while the insurgents and those sympathetic to their struggle may reject this characterization and portray -LRB- and justify -RRB- the killing as political assassination .<-->O
In order to avoid this kind of relativism , Primoratz puts forward a view that in one important respect takes on board the standpoint of the terrorist .<-->O
The direct victims of terrorism are innocent in the sense of not being responsible , on any credible understanding of responsibility and liability , for the injustice or oppression the terrorists fight against not responsible at all , or at least not responsible to the degree that makes them liable to be killed or maimed on that account .<-->O
The injustice or oppression at issue need not be real ; it may be merely alleged -LRB- by the terrorists -RRB- .<-->O
Being responsible for a merely alleged great injustice or oppression is enough for losing one 's immunity against violence , as far as the type of immunity and innocence relevant to defining terrorism is concerned .<-->O
According to mainstream just war theory one does not lose immunity against acts of war only by fighting in an unjust war , but by fighting in any war -LRB- Walzer 2000 : 36 41 -RRB- .<-->O
Similarly , one does not lose immunity against political violence only by holding office in or implementing policies of a gravely unjust government , but by holding office in or implementing policies of any government : as King Umberto I of Italy said after surviving an assassination attempt , such risk comes with the job .<-->O
Members of these two classes are not considered innocent and morally protected against violence by those attacking them ; the latter view their acts as acts of war proper or of political assassination , respectively .<-->O
If the terrorists subscribe to a credible view of responsibility and liability , then , when they attack common citizens , they attack people innocent from their own point of view , i.e. , innocent even if we grant the terrorists their assessment of the policies at issue .<-->O
-LRB- This is not to say that those who consider a government to be gravely unjust have a moral license to kill its officials , but only that if they do so , that will not be terrorism , but rather political assassination .<-->O
We can still condemn their actions if we reject their judgment of the policies at issue , or if we accept that judgment , but believe that they should have opposed those policies by nonviolent means .<-->O
But we will not be condemning their actions qua terrorism . -RRB-<-->N
On this account , not only real , but also merely alleged injustice or oppression counts in determining the innocence of the victims and deciding which acts are acts of terrorism ; thus such decisions are not hostage to endless debates about the moral status of contested policies .<-->O
Nevertheless , a residue of relativity remains .<-->N
The account presupposes a certain understanding of responsibility and liability : a person is responsible for a state of affairs only by virtue of that person 's voluntary , i.e. , informed and free , act or omission that has a sufficiently strong connection with that state of affairs , and thereby becomes liable to some proportionately unfavorable response .<-->O
Provided the terrorists accept some such understanding of responsibility and liability , they kill and maim people they themselves must admit to be innocent .<-->O
To be sure , some militant organizations resort to violence which we perceive as terrorist , yet object to the label .<-->O
They profess a view of responsibility and liability based on extremely far-fetched connections between states of affairs and human choices and actions , and argue that entire social classes or nations are responsible for certain policies and practices and all their members are liable to be attacked by deadly violence -LRB- see 2.1 below -RRB- .<-->O
Such arguments can only be regarded as preposterous .<-->N
We should insist on viewing their actions as terrorist , although they reject this description .<-->O
It is not clear how this residue of relativity could be removed -LRB- Primoratz 2013 : 16-21 -RRB- .<-->N
Some object to defining terrorism as violence against non-combatants or innocent persons .<-->O
They argue that doing so runs together the question of the nature of terrorism and that of its moral status , and begs the moral issue by making terrorism unjustified by definition .<-->O
We should rather keep these questions separate , and take care not to prejudge the latter by giving a wrong answer to the former .<-->O
What is needed is a morally neutral definition of terrorism , and that means a wide one -LRB- Corlett 2003 : 114 20 , 134 35 ; Young 2004 : 57 -RRB- .<-->N
But it is doubtful that terrorism can be defined in some morally untainted way .<-->N
The wide definitions these philosophers adopt contain the word violence , which is itself morally loaded .<-->N
A narrow definition is not completely morally neutral , as violence against the innocent is clearly morally wrong .<-->O
But what is clear is that such violence is prima facie wrong .<-->O
The definition implies a general presumption against terrorism , not its sweeping moral condemnation in each and every instance , whatever the circumstances and whatever the consequences of desisting from it .<-->O
The definition does not rule out that in certain circumstances it might not be wrong , all things considered .<-->O
Ethical investigation is not preempted : a particular case of terrorism still needs to be judged on its merits .<-->O
Another way of settling the issue of wide vs. narrow definition is offered by Georg Meggle .<-->N
He adopts a wide definition of terrorism , and goes on to distinguish two different types : terrorism in the strong sense , which deliberately , recklessly , or negligently harms innocent people , and terrorism in the weak sense , which does not .<-->O
Obviously , the moral assessment of the two types of terrorism is going to be significantly different -LRB- Meggle 2005 -RRB- .<-->O
1.2.3 Some idiosyncratic definitions The vast majority of cases almost anyone without an ax to grind would want to classify as terrorism exhibit the two traits implied in ordinary use and highlighted by mainstream philosophical definitions such as those quoted above : violence and intimidation .<-->O
But philosophical literature also offers definitions that leave out one or the other core component .<-->N
Some seek to sever the connection between terrorism and violence .<-->N
Carl Wellman defines terrorism as the use or attempted use of terror as a means of coercion .<-->O
Terrorism is often associated with violence , but that is because violence is a very effective means of intimidation .<-->O
Yet violence is not essential to terrorism and , in fact , most acts of terrorism are nonviolent -LRB- Wellman 1979 : 250 51 -RRB- .<-->O
The last claim seems false on any non-circular interpretation .<-->N
There may be many acts generally considered terrorist that do not involve actual violence , but are meant to intimidate by threatening it ; but that is not enough to support the notion of non-violent terrorism , which seems odd .<-->O
So does Wellman 's example of classroom terrorism : a professor threatens to fail students who submit their essays after the due date , causes panic in class , and thereby engages in terrorism .<-->O
Robert E. Goodin offers a similar account , emphasizing the political role of terrorism : terrorism is a political tactic , involving the deliberate frightening of people for political advantage -LRB- Goodin 2006 : 49 -RRB- .<-->O
This , he claims , is the distinctive wrong terrorists commit .<-->N
Whereas on Wellman 's account one can commit an act of terrorism without either engaging in or threatening violence , merely by making a threat in order to intimidate , on Goodin 's account one need not even make a threat : one acts as a terrorist by merely issuing a warning about the acts of others that is meant to intimidate .<-->O
This , too , seems arbitrary , although it makes sense as a step in an argument meant to show that if -LRB- or insofar as -RRB- Western political leaders are intending to frighten people for their own political advantage , then -LRB- to that extent -RRB- they are committing the same core wrong that is distinctively associated with terrorism -LRB- Goodin 2006 : 2 -RRB- .<-->O
It has also been suggested that terrorism need not be understood as inducing terror or fear .<-->O
According to Ted Honderich , terrorism is best defined as violence , short of war , political , illegal and prima facie wrong -LRB- Honderich 2006 : 88 -RRB- .<-->O
This definition might be thought problematic on several counts , but the idea of terrorism without terror seems especially odd .<-->O
The two are connected etymologically and historically , and this connection is deeply entrenched in current ordinary use .<-->N
Intimidation is not the morally salient trait of terrorism -LRB- pace Goodin -RRB- , but it is one of its core traits that cause most of us to condemn the practice .<-->O
We might consider severing the connection if Honderich offered a good reason for doing so .<-->O
But he supports his highly revisionary definition by the puzzling claim that to define terrorism as violence meant to intimidate is to imply that terrorism is particularly abhorrent and thereby in effect invite a kind of prima facie approval or tolerance of war -LRB- Honderich 2006 : 93 -RRB- .<-->O
The moral issue Can terrorism be morally justified ?<-->N
There is no single answer to this question , as there is no single conception of what terrorism is .<-->N
If we put aside definitions that depart too much , and for no compelling reason , from the core meaning of terrorism -LRB- such as those cited in 1.2.3 -RRB- , we still need to decide whether the question assumes a wide or a narrow understanding of terrorism .<-->O
A narrow conception of terrorism seems to be better suited to ethical investigation -LRB- 1.2.2 -RRB- .<-->O
Moreover , philosophers who work with a wide definition typically hold that terrorism that targets non-combatants or innocent persons is much more difficult to justify than selective terrorism which attacks only those who can not plausibly claim innocence of the injustice or oppression at issue -LRB- and which accordingly does not count as terrorism on a narrow definition of the term -RRB- .<-->O
The present discussion therefore focuses on terrorism understood as violence against innocent civilians or common citizens , intended to intimidate and thereby to achieve some further -LRB- political -RRB- objective or , more broadly , to coerce .<-->O
One might try to justify some acts or campaigns of violence of this kind in two ways .<-->O
One could argue that the victims may be non-combatants or common citizens , but nevertheless are not innocent of the wrongs the terrorists are fighting against .<-->O
Alternatively , one could concede the innocence of the victims and argue that attacks on them are nevertheless justified , either by their consequences on balance , or by some deontological considerations .<-->O
2.1 Complicity of the victims If the former line of argument is successful , will it prove too much ?<-->O
In showing that an instance of violence was justified because those targeted were not really innocent , we will have shown that the act or campaign of violence at issue was actually not a case of terrorism .<-->O
This may be merely a matter of semantics .<-->N
There is a much more damaging objection .<-->O
A terrorist act is characteristically the killing or injuring of a random collection of people who happen to be in a certain place at a certain time .<-->N
Arguments to the effect that those people are not innocent of the wrongs the terrorist fights against will therefore have a very wide reach , and accordingly will be based on some simplistic conception of collective responsibility .<-->O
These arguments will be of the sort offered , for example , by the 19th century anarchist Emile Henry .<-->O
He planted a bomb at the office of a mining company which , if it had exploded , would have killed or injured a number of people who did not work for the company , but lived in the same building .<-->N
He also planted a bomb in a caf that did go off , injuring twenty people , one of whom later died of his injuries .<-->N
At his trial , Henry explained : What about the innocent victims ?<-->N
-LSB- -RSB- The building where the Carmeaux Company had its offices was inhabited only by the bourgeois ; hence there would be no innocent victims .<-->N
The whole of the bourgeoisie lives by the exploitation of the unfortunate , and should expiate its crimes together -LRB- Henry 1977 : 193 -RRB- .<-->O
When commenting on the second attack , he said : Those good bourgeois who hold no office but who reap their dividends and live idly on the profits of the workers ' toil , they also must take their share in the reprisals .<-->O
And not only they , but all those who are satisfied with the existing order , who applaud the acts of the government and so become its accomplices in other words , the daily clientele of Terminus and other great caf s !<-->O
-LRB- Henry 1977 : 195 -RRB- This is an utterly implausible view of responsibility and liability .<-->O
It claims that all members of a social class men and women , young and old , adults and children are liable to be killed or maimed : some for operating the system of exploitation , others for supporting it , and still others for benefiting from it .<-->O
Even if , for the sake of argument , we grant the anarchist 's harsh moral condemnation of capitalist society , not every type and degree of involvement with it can justify the use of extreme violence .<-->O
Giving the system political support , or benefiting from it , may be morally objectionable , but is surely not enough to make one liable to be blown to pieces .<-->O
Another , more recent example , is provided by Osama Bin Laden .<-->N
In an interview in the aftermath of the attacks on September 11 , 2001 he said : The American people should remember that they pay taxes to their government and that they voted for their president .<-->N
Their government makes weapons and provides them to Israel , which they use to kill Palestinian Muslims .<-->N
Given that the American Congress is a committee that represents the people , the fact that it agrees with the actions of the American government proves that America in its entirety is responsible for the atrocities that it is committing against Muslims -LRB- Bin Laden 2005 : 140 141 -RRB- .<-->O
This , too , is a preposterous understanding of responsibility and liability .<-->O
For it claims that all Americans are eligible to be killed or maimed : some for devising and implementing America 's policies , others for participating in the political process , still others for paying taxes .<-->N
Even if , for the sake of argument , we grant Bin Laden 's severe condemnation of those policies , not every type and degree of involvement with them can justify the use of lethal violence .<-->O
Surely voting in elections or paying taxes is not enough to make one fair game .<-->O
Attempts at justification of terrorism that concede that its victims are innocent seem more promising .<-->O
They fall into two groups , depending on the type of ethical theory on which they are based .<-->N
2.2 Consequentialism Adherents of consequentialism judge terrorism , like every other practice , solely by its consequences .<-->N
Terrorism is not considered wrong in itself , but only if it has bad consequences on balance .<-->N
The innocence of the victims does not change that .<-->N
This is an instance of a general trait of consequentialism often highlighted by its critics , for example in the debate about the moral justification of legal punishment .<-->O
A standard objection to the consequentialist approach to punishment has been that it implies that punishment of the innocent is justified , when its consequences are good on balance .<-->O
This objection can only get off the ground because consequentialism denies that in such matters a person 's innocence is morally significant in itself .<-->O
Those who consider terrorism from a consequentialist point of view differ in their assessment of its morality .<-->O
Their judgment on terrorism depends on their view of the good to be promoted by its use and on their assessment of the utility of terrorism as a means of promoting it .<-->O
There is room for disagreement on both issues .<-->N
2.2.1 Terrorism justified Kai Nielsen approaches questions to do with political violence in general and terrorism in particular as a consequentialist in ethics and a socialist in politics .<-->N
The use of neither can be ruled out categorically ; it all depends on their utility as a method for attaining morally and politically worthwhile objectives such as a truly socialist society or liberation from colonial rule .<-->O
When and where -LSB- either -RSB- should be employed is a tactical question that must be decided on a case-by-case basis like the choice of weapon in a war -LRB- Nielsen 1981 : 435 -RRB- .<-->O
Nielsen has a wide definition of terrorism , but his examples show that the innocence of the victims of terrorism makes no difference to its justification that is , that his conclusions apply to terrorism in both the wide and narrow sense .<-->O
In his view , terrorist acts must be justified by their political effects and their moral consequences .<-->O
They are justified -LRB- 1 -RRB- when they are politically effective weapons in the revolutionary struggle and -LRB- 2 -RRB- when , everything considered , there are sound reasons for believing that , by the use of that type of violence rather than no violence at all or violence of some other type , there will be less injustice , suffering and degradation in the world than would otherwise have been the case -LRB- Nielsen 1981 : 446 -RRB- .<-->O
Historical experience , in Nielsen 's view , tells us that terrorism on a small scale , used as the sole method of struggle in order to provoke the masses into revolutionary action , is ineffective and often counterproductive .<-->O
On the other hand , terrorism employed in conjunction with guerrilla warfare in a protracted war of liberation may well prove useful and therefore also justified , as it did in Algeria and South Vietnam .<-->O
-LRB- For an earlier statement of the same view , see Trotsky 1961 : 48 59 , 62 65 . -RRB-<-->N
2.2.2 Terrorism unjustified Nicholas Fotion also uses a wide definition of terrorism .<-->O
He , too , is a consequentialist -LRB- although some of his remarks concerning the innocence of many victims of terrorism might be more at home in nonconsequentialist ethics -RRB- .<-->O
But he finds standard consequentialist assessments of terrorism such as Nielsen 's too permissive .<-->O
If some types of terrorism are justifiable under certain circumstances , such circumstances will be extremely rare .<-->O
Terrorists and their apologists do not perform the requisite calculations properly .<-->N
One problem is the higher good to be promoted by terrorism : more often than not , it is defined in ideological terms , rather than derived from settled preferences or interests of actual people .<-->O
But for the most part Fotion discusses the issue of means .<-->N
If a terrorist act or campaign is to be justified instrumentally , it must be shown -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the end sought is good enough to justify the means , -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the end will indeed be achieved by means of terrorism , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- that the end can not be achieved in any other way that is morally and otherwise less costly .<-->O
Terrorists not only , as a matter of fact , fail to discharge this burden ; Fotion argues that , with regard to terrorism that victimizes innocent people , it can not be discharged .<-->O
All direct victims of terrorism are treated as objects to be used indeed , used up by the terrorist .<-->O
But in being treated as an object , the innocent victim is worse off than the -LRB- alleged -RRB- guilty victim .<-->O
Insofar as the latter is judged to have done a wrong , he is thought of as a human .<-->N
-LSB- -RSB- For the terrorist the innocent victim is neither a human in this judgmental sense nor a human in the sense of simply having value as a human being .<-->O
Of course the terrorist needs to pick a human being as a victim because -LSB- that -RSB- brings about more terror But this does not involve treating them as humans .<-->N
Rather , they are victimized and thereby treated as objects because they are humans -LRB- Fotion 1981 : 464 -RRB- .<-->N
In reply , terrorists can claim that they advisedly sacrifice valued human beings for a higher good .<-->O
But for this claim to carry any conviction , they would have to show that they have no alternative .<-->O
Yet , Fotion argues , they always have the alternative of taking on the opponent 's military establishment , and often also have the option of going after government officials responsible for the wrongs they object to , instead of attacking innocent persons .<-->O
That kind of terrorism may sometimes be justified , whereas terrorism that targets innocent people never is .<-->O
2.3 Nonconsequentialism Within a nonconsequentialist approach to morality , terrorism is considered wrong in itself , because of what it is , rather than only because -LRB- and insofar as -RRB- its consequences are bad on balance .<-->O
But this is not to say that this approach leaves no room whatever for morally justifying certain acts or campaigns of terrorism .<-->O
Indeed , nonconsequentialist discussions of terrorism also present a range of positions and arguments .<-->N
A nonconsequentialist might try to justify an act or campaign of terrorism in one of two ways .<-->O
One might invoke some deontological considerations , such as justice or rights , in favor of resorting to terrorism under certain circumstances .<-->O
Alternatively , one might argue that the obvious , and obviously very weighty , considerations of rights -LRB- of the victims of terrorism -RRB- and justice -LRB- which demands respect for those rights -RRB- may sometimes be overridden by extremely weighty considerations of consequences an extremely high price that would be paid for not resorting to terrorism .<-->O
For the rejection of consequentialism is of course not tantamount to denying that consequences of our actions , policies , and practices matter in their moral assessment ; what is denied is the consequentialists ' claim that only consequences matter .<-->O
2.3.1 Basic human rights and distributive justice Virginia Held operates with a broad notion of terrorism , but her justification of terrorism is meant to apply to terrorism that targets common citizens .<-->O
Her discussion of the subject focuses on the issue of rights .<-->N
When rights of a person or group are not respected , what may we do in order to ensure that they are ?<-->N
On one view , known as consequentialism of rights , if the only way to ensure respect of a certain right of A and B is to infringe the same right of C , we shall be justified in doing so .<-->O
Held does not hold that such trade-offs in rights with the aim of maximizing their respect in a society are appropriate .<-->O
Yet rights sometimes come into conflict , whether directly or indirectly -LRB- as in the above example -RRB- .<-->O
When that happens , there is no way we can avoid comparing the rights involved as more or less stringent and making certain choices between them .<-->O
That applies to the case of terrorism too .<-->N
Terrorism obviously violates some human rights of its victims .<-->N
But its advocates claim that in some circumstances a limited use of terrorism is the only way of bringing about a society where human rights of all will be respected .<-->O
Even when this claim is true , that is not enough to make resort to terrorism justified .<-->O
But it will be justified if an additional condition is met : that of distributive justice .<-->N
If there is a society where the human rights of a part of the population are respected , while the same rights of another part of the population are being violated ; if the only way of changing that and ensuring that human rights of all are respected is a limited use of terrorism ; finally , if terrorism is directed against members of the first group , which up to now has been privileged as far as respect of human rights is concerned then terrorism will be morally justified .<-->O
This is a justification in terms of distributive justice , applied to the problem of violations of human rights .<-->O
It is more just to equalize the violations of human rights in a stage of transition to a society where the rights of all are respected , than to allow that the group which has already suffered large-scale violations of human rights suffer even more such violations -LRB- assuming that in both cases we are dealing with violations of the same , or equally stringent , human rights -RRB- .<-->O
Human rights of many are going to be violated in any case ; it is more just , and therefore morally preferable , that their violations should be distributed in a more equitable way -LRB- Held 2008 -RRB- .<-->O
It might be objected that in calling for sacrificing such basic human rights as the right to life and to bodily security of individual victims of terrorism for the sake of a more just distribution of violations of the same rights within a group in the course of transition to a stage where these rights will be respected throughout that group , Held offends against the principles of separateness of persons and respect for persons -LRB- Primoratz 1997 : 230 31 -RRB- .<-->O
In response , Held argues that to fail to achieve a more just distribution of violations of rights -LRB- through the use of terrorism if that is the only means available -RRB- is to fail to recognize that those whose rights are already not fairly respected are individuals in their own right , not merely members of a group whose rights can be ignored .<-->O
An argument for achieving a just distribution of rights violations is not necessarily about groups ; it can be an argument about the rights of individuals to fairness -LRB- Held 2008 : 89 90 -RRB- .<-->O
-LRB- For further objections to Held 's argument , see Steinhoff 2007 : 125 30 ; Nath 2011 . -RRB-<-->O
2.3.2 Supreme emergency and moral disaster In Held 's justification of terrorism , it is justice that requires that inescapable violations of human rights be more evenly distributed .<-->O
There is a different way of allowing for the use of terrorism under certain circumstances within a nonconsequentialist approach to the ethics of violence .<-->N
It could be argued that , as far as justice and rights are concerned , terrorism -LRB- or , in Held 's terminology , the kind of terrorism that targets the innocent -RRB- is never justified .<-->O
Furthermore , considerations of justice and rights carry much greater weight than considerations of good and bad consequences , and therefore normally trump the latter in cases of conflict .<-->O
However , in exceptional circumstances considerations concerning consequences the price of not resorting to terrorism may be so extremely weighty as to override those of justice and rights .<-->O
Michael Walzer offers an argument along these lines in his discussion of terror bombing of German cities in World War II .<-->N
In early 1942 , it seemed that Britain would be defeated by Germany and that its military could not prevail while fighting in accordance with the rules of war .<-->O
Britain was the only remaining obstacle to the subjugation of most of Europe by the Nazis .<-->O
That was an ultimate threat to everything decent in our lives , an ideology and a practice of domination so murderous , so degrading even to those who might survive , that the consequences of its final victory were literally beyond calculation , immeasurably awful -LRB- Walzer 2000 : 253 -RRB- .<-->O
Thus Britain was facing a supreme emergency : an -LRB- a -RRB- imminent threat of -LRB- b -RRB- something utterly unthinkable from a moral point of view .<-->O
In such an emergency a case of the dirty hands predicament that so often plagues political action -LRB- see Walzer 1973 -RRB- one may breach a basic and weighty moral principle such as civilian immunity , if that is the only hope of fending off the threat .<-->O
So for more than three years , the RAF , later joined by the USAAF , deliberately devastated many German cities , killed about 600,000 civilians and seriously injured another 800,000 in an attempt to terrorize the German people into forcing their leadership to halt the war and surrender unconditionally .<-->O
By early 1943 it was clear that Germany was not going to win the war , and all subsequent terror bombing lacked moral justification .<-->O
But in its first year , in Walzer 's view , the terror bombing of Germany was morally justified as a response to the supreme emergency Britain was facing .<-->O
Walzer then expands the notion of supreme emergency to apply to a single political community facing the threat of extermination or enslavement , and eventually to a single political community whose survival and freedom are at stake .<-->O
For the survival and freedom of political communities whose members share a way of life , developed by their ancestors , to be passed on to their children are the highest values of international society -LRB- Walzer 2000 : 254 -RRB- .<-->O
Here we have two different conceptions of supreme emergency .<-->N
The threat is imminent in both , but the nature of the threat differs : it is one thing to suffer the fate the Nazis had in store for peoples they considered racially inferior , and another to have one 's polity dismantled .<-->O
By moving back and forth between these two types of supreme emergency under the ambiguous heading of threat to the survival and freedom of a political community , Walzer seeks to extend to the latter the moral response that might be appropriate to the former .<-->O
Yet whereas genocide , expulsion , or enslavement of an entire people might be thought a moral disaster that may be fended off by any means , its loss of political independence is , at most , a political disaster .<-->O
If a polity to be dismantled lacks moral legitimacy , its demise may well be a moral improvement .<-->O
But even if a polity does have moral legitimacy , a threat to its survival and freedom falls short of an ultimate threat to everything decent in our lives .<-->O
If so , its military can not be justified in waging war on enemy civilians in order to defend it .<-->O
There is another , less permissive position constructed along similar lines , but based on a more austere view of what counts as a moral disaster that might justify resort to terrorism .<-->O
Contrary to what many fighters against social or economic oppression , colonial rule , or foreign occupation believe , evils of such magnitude that they can justify indiscriminate killing and maiming of innocent people are extremely rare .<-->O
Not every case of oppression , foreign rule , or occupation , however morally indefensible , amounts to a moral disaster in the relevant sense .<-->O
Nor does every imminent threat to the survival and freedom of a political community qualify , contrary to what Walzer has argued .<-->O
However , if an entire people is subjected to extermination , or to an attempt at ethnically cleansing it from its land , then it is facing a true moral disaster and may properly consider terrorism as a method of struggle against such a fate .<-->O
In view of their enormity and finality , extermination and ethnic cleansing of an entire people constitute a category apart .<-->O
To be sure , resorting to terrorism in such a case will be morally justified only if there are very good grounds for believing that terrorism will succeed where nothing else will : in preventing imminent extermination or ethnic cleansing , or stopping it if it is already under way .<-->O
Cases where both conditions are met will be extremely rare .<-->O
Indeed , history may not offer a single example .<-->N
But that does not mean that that no act or campaign of terrorism could ever satisfy these conditions and thus turn out to be justified .<-->O
Accordingly , terrorism is almost absolutely wrong -LRB- Primoratz 2013 : chapter 6 -RRB- .<-->O
Both the supreme emergency and the moral disaster view will justify a resort to terrorism only when that is the only way to deal with the emergency , or to prevent the disaster , respectively .<-->O
Just how certain must we be that terrorism will indeed achieve the goal , while no other method will ?<-->O
One might argue that when in extremis , we can not apply stringent epistemic standards in deciding how to cope indeed , if we can not really know what will work , we must take our chances with what might .<-->O
This is Walzer 's view : in such a predicament , we must wager the crime of terrorism against the evil that is otherwise in store for us .<-->O
There is no option ; the risk otherwise is too great -LRB- Walzer 2000 : 259 260 -RRB- .<-->O
It may be objected that this position highlights the enormity of the threat , while failing to give due weight to the enormity of the means proposed for fending off the threat the enormity of terrorism , of deliberately killing and maiming innocent people .<-->O
When that is taken into account , the conclusion may rather be that even in extremis , if terrorism is to be justified , the reasons for believing that it will work and that nothing else will must be very strong indeed .<-->O
2.3.3 Terrorism absolutely wrong Some hold that terrorism is absolutely wrong .<-->O
This position , too , comes in different versions .<-->N
Some philosophers work with a wide definition of terrorism , and argue that under certain circumstances selective terrorism that targets only those seriously implicated in the wrongs at issue may be justified -LRB- Corlett 2003 , Young 2004 -RRB- .<-->O
This seems to suggest that terrorism which is not selective in this way that is , terrorism in the narrow sense is never justified .<-->O
Yet this does not follow : there is still room for arguing that terrorism of the latter type can be justified by further considerations , such as those of supreme emergency or moral disaster .<-->O
Per Bauhn does not leave it at that .<-->N
He attempts to show that terrorism that targets non-combatants or common citizens can never be justified by deploying a slightly amended version of Alan Gewirth 's ethical theory .<-->O
Freedom and safety are fundamental prerequisites of action and therefore must be accorded paramount weight .<-->O
The need to protect them generates a range of rights ; the right pertinent here is an absolute right not to be made the intended victims of a homicidal project all innocent persons have -LRB- Gewirth 1981 : 16 -RRB- .<-->O
When the absolute status of this right is challenged by invoking supreme emergency or moral disaster , Bauhn argues that there is a moral difference between what we are positively and directly causally responsible for , and what we are causally responsible for only indirectly , by failing to prevent other persons from intentionally bringing it about .<-->O
We are morally responsible for the former , but -LRB- except in certain special circumstances -RRB- not for the latter .<-->O
If we refuse to resort to terrorism in order not to target innocent persons , and thus fail to prevent some other persons from perpetrating atrocities , it is only the perpetrators who will be morally responsible for those atrocities .<-->O
Therefore we must refuse -LRB- Bauhn 1989 : chapter 5 -RRB- .<-->O
Stephen Nathanson seeks to ground absolute immunity of civilians or common citizens and absolute prohibition of terrorism it entails in a rule-consequentialist ethical theory -LRB- Nathanson 2010 : 191 208 -RRB- .<-->O
Adopting civilian immunity , rather than adopting any other rule regulating the matter or having no rule at all , is the best way to reduce the killing and destruction in armed conflict .<-->O
Moreover , the best consequences will be achieved by adopting it as an absolute rule , rather than as a rule allowing for exceptions in supreme emergencies .<-->O
The idea of supreme emergency is vague .<-->O
The criteria for proffering supreme emergency exemptions are liable to be applied in arbitrary and subjective ways .<-->O
Finally , there is the slippery slope argument : permitting -LSB- departures from the rule of civilian immunity , including terrorism -RSB- even under the direst circumstances will lower the bar for justifying such acts ... broadcast the message that such behavior may sometimes be justified and ... thus lend its weight to increasing the use of such methods -LRB- Nathanson 2010 : 207 -RRB- .<-->O
However , one can adopt rule-consequentialism as one 's ethical theory and yet view the immunity of civilians or common citizens and the attendant prohibition of terrorism as very stringent , but not absolute moral rules .<-->O
Thus Richard B. Brandt and Brad Hooker do not view this immunity as absolute .<-->O
They argue that a set of moral rules selected because of the good consequences of their adoption should include a rule that allows and indeed requires one to prevent disaster even if that means breaking some other moral rule .<-->O
Even such a stringent moral rule as the prohibition of deliberate use of violence against innocent people may be overridden , if the disaster that can not be prevented in any other way is grave enough .<-->O
-LRB- See Brandt 1992 : 87 88 , 150 51 , 156 57 ; Hooker 2000 : 98 99 , 127 36 -RRB- .<-->N
There is thus some convergence at the level of practical conclusions between their understanding of the immunity of civilians or common citizens and the moral disaster position outlined above -LRB- 2.3.2 -RRB- .<-->O

------------------------------------------------------------ THE PRESIDENT : Your Majesties , Your Royal Highnesses , distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , citizens of America , and citizens of the world : I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility .<-->O
It is an award that speaks to our highest aspirations -- that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world , we are not mere prisoners of fate .<-->O
Our actions matter , and can bend history in the direction of justice .<-->N
And yet I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated .<-->O
-LRB- Laughter . -RRB-<-->N
In part , this is because I am at the beginning , and not the end , of my labors on the world stage .<-->N
Compared to some of the giants of history who 've received this prize -- Schweitzer and King ; Marshall and Mandela -- my accomplishments are slight .<-->O
And then there are the men and women around the world who have been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice ; those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering ; the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics .<-->O
I can not argue with those who find these men and women -- some known , some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than I .<-->O
But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars .<-->O
One of these wars is winding down .<-->N
The other is a conflict that America did not seek ; one in which we are joined by 42 other countries -- including Norway -- in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks .<-->O
Still , we are at war , and I 'm responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land .<-->O
Some will kill , and some will be killed .<-->O
And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict -- filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace , and our effort to replace one with the other .<-->O
Now these questions are not new .<-->N
War , in one form or another , appeared with the first man .<-->N
At the dawn of history , its morality was not questioned ; it was simply a fact , like drought or disease -- the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences .<-->O
And over time , as codes of law sought to control violence within groups , so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war .<-->O
The concept of a `` just war '' emerged , suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met : if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense ; if the force used is proportional ; and if , whenever possible , civilians are spared from violence .<-->O
Of course , we know that for most of history , this concept of `` just war '' was rarely observed .<-->O
The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible , as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God .<-->O
Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations -- total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred .<-->N
In the span of 30 years , such carnage would twice engulf this continent .<-->O
And while it 's hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers , World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished .<-->O
In the wake of such destruction , and with the advent of the nuclear age , it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another world war .<-->O
And so , a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the League of Nations -- an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize -- America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace : a Marshall Plan and a United Nations , mechanisms to govern the waging of war , treaties to protect human rights , prevent genocide , restrict the most dangerous weapons .<-->O
In many ways , these efforts succeeded .<-->N
Yes , terrible wars have been fought , and atrocities committed .<-->O
But there has been no Third World War .<-->N
The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall .<-->N
Commerce has stitched much of the world together .<-->N
Billions have been lifted from poverty .<-->N
The ideals of liberty and self-determination , equality and the rule of law have haltingly advanced .<-->O
We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past , and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud .<-->O
And yet , a decade into a new century , this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats .<-->N
The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers , but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe .<-->O
Terrorism has long been a tactic , but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale .<-->O
Moreover , wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations .<-->N
The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts ; the growth of secessionist movements , insurgencies , and failed states -- all these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos .<-->N
In today 's wars , many more civilians are killed than soldiers ; the seeds of future conflict are sown , economies are wrecked , civil societies torn asunder , refugees amassed , children scarred .<-->O
I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war .<-->O
What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision , hard work , and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago .<-->O
And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace .<-->O
We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth : We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes .<-->O
There will be times when nations -- acting individually or in concert -- will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified .<-->O
I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago : `` Violence never brings permanent peace .<-->N
It solves no social problem : it merely creates new and more complicated ones . ''<-->O
As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King 's life work , I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence .<-->O
I know there 's nothing weak -- nothing passive -- nothing na ve -- in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King .<-->O
But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation , I can not be guided by their examples alone .<-->O
I face the world as it is , and can not stand idle in the face of threats to the American people .<-->O
For make no mistake : Evil does exist in the world .<-->N
A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler 's armies .<-->N
Negotiations can not convince al Qaeda 's leaders to lay down their arms .<-->N
To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism -- it is a recognition of history ; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason .<-->O
I raise this point , I begin with this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today , no matter what the cause .<-->O
And at times , this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America , the world 's sole military superpower .<-->N
But the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world .<-->O
Whatever mistakes we have made , the plain fact is this : The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms .<-->O
The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea , and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans .<-->O
We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will .<-->O
We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren , and we believe that their lives will be better if others ' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity .<-->O
So yes , the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace .<-->O
And yet this truth must coexist with another -- that no matter how justified , war promises human tragedy .<-->O
The soldier 's courage and sacrifice is full of glory , expressing devotion to country , to cause , to comrades in arms .<-->O
But war itself is never glorious , and we must never trumpet it as such .<-->O
So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly inreconcilable truths -- that war is sometimes necessary , and war at some level is an expression of human folly .<-->O
Concretely , we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago .<-->O
`` Let us focus , '' he said , `` on a more practical , more attainable peace , based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions . ''<-->O
A gradual evolution of human institutions .<-->N
What might this evolution look like ?<-->O
What might these practical steps be ?<-->O
To begin with , I believe that all nations -- strong and weak alike -- must adhere to standards that govern the use of force .<-->O
I -- like any head of state -- reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation .<-->O
Nevertheless , I am convinced that adhering to standards , international standards , strengthens those who do , and isolates and weakens those who do n't .<-->N
The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks , and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan , because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense .<-->O
Likewise , the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait -- a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression .<-->O
Furthermore , America -- in fact , no nation -- can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves .<-->O
For when we do n't , our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions , no matter how justified .<-->O
And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self-defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor .<-->O
More and more , we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government , or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region .<-->O
I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the Balkans , or in other places that have been scarred by war .<-->O
Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later .<-->N
That 's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace .<-->O
America 's commitment to global security will never waver .<-->O
But in a world in which threats are more diffuse , and missions more complex , America can not act alone .<-->N
America alone can not secure the peace .<-->N
This is true in Afghanistan .<-->N
This is true in failed states like Somalia , where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering .<-->O
And sadly , it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come .<-->O
The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries , and other friends and allies , demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they 've shown in Afghanistan .<-->O
But in many countries , there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public .<-->N
I understand why war is not popular , but I also know this : The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it .<-->O
Peace requires responsibility .<-->N
Peace entails sacrifice .<-->N
That 's why NATO continues to be indispensable .<-->N
That 's why we must strengthen U.N. and regional peacekeeping , and not leave the task to a few countries .<-->N
That 's why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome ; to Ottawa and Sydney ; to Dhaka and Kigali -- we honor them not as makers of war , but of wagers -- but as wagers of peace .<-->O
Let me make one final point about the use of force .<-->N
Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war , we must also think clearly about how we fight it .<-->O
The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant -- the founder of the Red Cross , and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions .<-->O
Where force is necessary , we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct .<-->O
And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules , I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war .<-->O
That is what makes us different from those whom we fight .<-->N
That is a source of our strength .<-->N
That is why I prohibited torture .<-->N
That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed .<-->N
And that is why I have reaffirmed America 's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions .<-->N
We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend .<-->O
-LRB- Applause . -RRB-<-->N
And we honor -- we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it 's easy , but when it is hard .<-->O
I have spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war .<-->N
But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices , and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace .<-->O
First , in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws , I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior -- for if we want a lasting peace , then the words of the international community must mean something .<-->O
Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable .<-->O
Sanctions must exact a real price .<-->O
Intransigence must be met with increased pressure -- and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one .<-->O
One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , and to seek a world without them .<-->N
In the middle of the last century , nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear : All will have access to peaceful nuclear power ; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them ; and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament .<-->O
I am committed to upholding this treaty .<-->N
It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy .<-->F
And I 'm working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia 's nuclear stockpiles .<-->N
But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system .<-->O
Those who claim to respect international law can not avert their eyes when those laws are flouted .<-->O
Those who care for their own security can not ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia .<-->O
Those who seek peace can not stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war .<-->O
The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people .<-->O
When there is genocide in Darfur , systematic rape in Congo , repression in Burma -- there must be consequences .<-->O
Yes , there will be engagement ; yes , there will be diplomacy -- but there must be consequences when those things fail .<-->O
And the closer we stand together , the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression .<-->O
This brings me to a second point -- the nature of the peace that we seek .<-->O
For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict .<-->O
Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting .<-->O
It was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War .<-->N
In the wake of devastation , they recognized that if human rights are not protected , peace is a hollow promise .<-->O
And yet too often , these words are ignored .<-->N
For some countries , the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles , foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation 's development .<-->O
And within America , there has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists -- a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world .<-->O
I reject these choices .<-->N
I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please ; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear .<-->O
Pent-up grievances fester , and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence .<-->N
We also know that the opposite is true .<-->O
Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace .<-->O
America has never fought a war against a democracy , and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens .<-->O
No matter how callously defined , neither America 's interests -- nor the world 's -- are served by the denial of human aspirations .<-->O
So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries , America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal .<-->O
We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi ; to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings ; to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran .<-->O
It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation .<-->O
And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements -- these movements of hope and history -- they have us on their side .<-->O
Let me also say this : The promotion of human rights can not be about exhortation alone .<-->N
At times , it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy .<-->O
I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation .<-->O
But I also know that sanctions without outreach -- condemnation without discussion -- can carry forward only a crippling status quo .<-->O
No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door .<-->O
In light of the Cultural Revolution 's horrors , Nixon 's meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable -- and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies .<-->O
Pope John Paul 's engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church , but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa .<-->O
Ronald Reagan 's efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union , but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe .<-->O
There 's no simple formula here .<-->N
But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement , pressure and incentives , so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time .<-->O
Third , a just peace includes not only civil and political rights -- it must encompass economic security and opportunity .<-->O
For true peace is not just freedom from fear , but freedom from want .<-->O
It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security ; it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food , or clean water , or the medicine and shelter they need to survive .<-->O
It does not exist where children ca n't aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family .<-->N
The absence of hope can rot a society from within .<-->O
And that 's why helping farmers feed their own people -- or nations educate their children and care for the sick -- is not mere charity .<-->O
It 's also why the world must come together to confront climate change .<-->N
There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing , we will face more drought , more famine , more mass displacement -- all of which will fuel more conflict for decades .<-->O
For this reason , it is not merely scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful action -- it 's military leaders in my own country and others who understand our common security hangs in the balance .<-->O
Agreements among nations .<-->N
Strong institutions .<-->F
Support for human rights .<-->F
Investments in development .<-->N
All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about .<-->N
And yet , I do not believe that we will have the will , the determination , the staying power , to complete this work without something more -- and that 's the continued expansion of our moral imagination ; an insistence that there 's something irreducible that we all share .<-->O
As the world grows smaller , you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are ; to understand that we 're all basically seeking the same things ; that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families .<-->O
And yet somehow , given the dizzying pace of globalization , the cultural leveling of modernity , it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities -- their race , their tribe , and perhaps most powerfully their religion .<-->O
In some places , this fear has led to conflict .<-->N
At times , it even feels like we 're moving backwards .<-->O
We see it in the Middle East , as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden .<-->N
We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines .<-->N
And most dangerously , we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam , and who attacked my country from Afghanistan .<-->O
These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God ; the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded .<-->O
But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war .<-->O
For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will , then there is no need for restraint -- no need to spare the pregnant mother , or the medic , or the Red Cross worker , or even a person of one 's own faith .<-->O
Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace , but I believe it 's incompatible with the very purpose of faith -- for the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us .<-->O
Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature .<-->O
For we are fallible .<-->N
We make mistakes , and fall victim to the temptations of pride , and power , and sometimes evil .<-->O
Even those of us with the best of intentions will at times fail to right the wrongs before us .<-->O
But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected .<-->O
We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place .<-->O
The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance , but the love that they preached -- their fundamental faith in human progress -- that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey .<-->O
For if we lose that faith -- if we dismiss it as silly or na ve ; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace -- then we lose what 's best about humanity .<-->O
We lose our sense of possibility .<-->O
We lose our moral compass .<-->N
Like generations have before us , we must reject that future .<-->O
As Dr. King said at this occasion so many years ago , `` I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history .<-->O
I refuse to accept the idea that the ` isness ' of man 's present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal ` oughtness ' that forever confronts him . ''<-->O
Let us reach for the world that ought to be -- that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls .<-->O
-LRB- Applause . -RRB-<-->N
Somewhere today , in the here and now , in the world as it is , a soldier sees he 's outgunned , but stands firm to keep the peace .<-->O
Somewhere today , in this world , a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government , but has the courage to march on .<-->O
Somewhere today , a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child , scrapes together what few coins she has to send that child to school -- because she believes that a cruel world still has a place for that child 's dreams .<-->O
Let us live by their example .<-->N
We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us , and still strive for justice .<-->O
We can admit the intractability of depravation , and still strive for dignity .<-->O
Clear-eyed , we can understand that there will be war , and still strive for peace .<-->O
We can do that -- for that is the story of human progress ; that 's the hope of all the world ; and at this moment of challenge , that must be our work here on Earth .<-->O

Report this Argument Debate Round No. 1 Juney Con ----------------------------------------------------------------- Now , I say that Parents Should NOT Be Held Responsible For Their School-going Children 's Discipline Problem .<-->N
Children should develop their own Individual Responsibility earlier .<-->N
It should be so , because children should be taught to be less dependent to their parents and to other elders in such a way that they learn to behave by themselves .<-->O
For a child , it is very common to commit mistakes .<-->N
By this , parents should know how to resolve such situations and teach their children do the right thing .<-->O
In this manner , children would be developing their responsibility .<-->N
Children usually have the attitude of Authority Aversion .<-->N
At this point , children usually do n't listen to their parents .<-->N
And so , we can see how parents are not responsible to their children 's discipline problems in school but their children themselves are .<-->O
I just want to point out here that these children are in a certain school to learn and to be educated .<-->O
By it , I mean that children are the only one that should be held responsible for their own actions .<-->O
Failures can never be avoided .<-->N
We can not expect parents to watch over their children all over the day .<-->N
So , we can say the parents never should be held responsible for the reason that they are not always their for their children .<-->O
Even though the parents are the one who knows the children best and the ones who taught and raised up their children but we can expect some parental responsibility failure at this time .<-->O
We can not assure every parents to be teaching every good attitude to their children .<-->O
And so , by these points it can be stated that Parents Should NOT Be Held Responsible For Their School-going Children 's Discipline Problem .<-->N
----------------------------------------------------------------- Parents should not be held responsible for their school going children 's discipline problems ?<-->O
The need to discipline children is a fact of life , and is an opportunity .<-->O
Sometimes the choices that children make end up in bigger consequences , but it all comes from the same place : children are not finished projects ... when parents send them away from the home , it is up to the school to use effective discipline and to accept the child as he or she is .<-->N
It is unreasonable for the school to expect a parent that is not present to be `` responsible '' for a child 's misbehavior - but a parent must be expected to be a part of the solution , not an enabler .<-->O
To the extent that the child 's growth and social development is the common goal of both the school and the parents , misbehavior must be seen as an opportunity to teach the child about acceptable social conventions and civilized behavior .<-->O
Labeling a child as bad and a parent as bad does not further this goal - it interferes with the ability of the school and the parent to work together .<-->O
If the parent is not part of the solution and is in fact an enabler , the parent must be held accountable for THEIR behavior in keeping the child stuck in a bad place in their social development , and when there is no way for the school to address discipline because the parent undermines the school , then the school should give up and remove the child when the child 's behavior reaches dangerous levels -LRB- expulsion -RRB- .<-->O
----------------------------------------------------------------- Children s discipline : is it the teacher or the parent s duty ?<-->N
Posted on August 20 , 2015 by melinatedmary Children s Discipline Children sometimes tend to challenge adult or parental experience by choosing to misbehave intentionally in order to achieve something .<-->O
However , this act should be taken as part of the children s natural development and plays a significant role in their growth although associated with a lot of consequences .<-->O
Discipline is how the children are well prepared in differentiating the acceptable from unacceptable and right from wrong .<-->O
Therefore , discipline is a very significant aspect of a child s development and educational progress in a given environment .<-->O
Parents are the major determinants of a child s behavior as they are the first individuals who spend time with them in their earlier lives thereby laying the foundation for their behavior .<-->N
Good parents should follow up the behavioral development of their children in case they care about the children s future -LRB- Debate Topic : Parents Should Be Held Responsible For Their School-going Children s Discipline Problem | Debate.org -RRB- .<-->N
Teachers have the responsibility of ensuring that the children maintain the already laid morals as they progress educationally .<-->N
In the recent days , the number of children has rapidly increased in schools therefore giving teachers a challenge of deeply monitoring the behavior of every pupil .<-->O
Therefore , there is a need for parents to impart keenly good morals to their children while at home .<-->O
This will give teachers humble time in carrying out their teaching responsibilities as there will be reduced indiscipline cases among the children .<-->O
It is evident that the discipline of children should start at home then be facilitated at school .<-->N
Parents should provide a good environment that will enable their children to grow within the accepted morals .<-->O
At home , the children need to be trained to respect their elders and obey their parents and teachers among other good morals .<-->O
It is from the parents responsibility that the children will be able to observe the school disciplinary measures .<-->O
Parents should nurture their children by taking care of their basic needs as well as giving them attention , love , understanding and support .<-->O
The children will probably feel worthy , lovable , listened to and became trusting .<-->O
It s through these nurturing that children will develop the foundations for their future behavior .<-->O
In most cases , children who are not well nurtured by their parents tend to misbehave due to the frustrations they face in their families .<-->O
Additionally , it is from home where children should be guided on important matters of their development .<-->N
The parents at home should provide the foundation for their children s behavior by imposing rules , holding children accountable , following up with consequences , and setting limits for them .<-->O
This will enable the children to learn responsible behavior , feel a sense of safety , tolerate frustration , and learn from their mistakes .<-->O
Therefore , the parents should play great responsibility in shaping the discipline of their children before they hand them over to teachers .<-->O
Children who are well disciplined by their parents often offer teachers easy times in imparting them with skills and tend to act within the acceptable morals .<-->O
Also , they are quick in adopting new morals introduced to them by teachers -LRB- Alvarenga , Oliveira , and Dazzani 12 -RRB- .<-->N
However , schools initiate much effort in shaping of the behavior of children as they provide the environment where children spend most time of their days .<-->N
Teachers substitute parents in schools by taking their roles .<-->N
They provide more stability in the children s lives by linking education with social service .<-->N
The teachers end up contributing much to the discipline of the children .<-->N
In every school , cases of indiscipline are inevitable basing a reason for the existence of disciplinary measures .<-->N
In the recent days , teachers are limited in dealing with disruptive behaviors among children with various legislations .<-->N
With these limitations , the teachers alone can not discipline children more so in situations whereby parents allow them to do whatever they want while out of school .<-->O
Furthermore , the teacher s role is to teach and not to keep on disciplining disruptive students in class as he/she ends up wasting a lot of time .<-->N
Whenever parents take their children to school , they usually develop many expectations about the responsibilities of teachers .<-->N
They expect the teachers efforts to nurture the children s behavior as well as impart them with appropriate skills and knowledge .<-->O
Over the period that teachers spend with students , it s clear that they contribute much to their lives .<-->N
The teachers have the responsibility of ensuring that the students are acting within the socially acceptable morals .<-->N
This is achieved through the proper deliverance of skills together with sufficient guidance and counseling in case the children are involved in challenging situations .<-->O
Schools pay much attention to the discipline of students as it acts as the determinant of their success -LRB- Alvarenga , Oliveira , and Dazzani 15 -RRB- .<-->N
Most curriculums implemented in schools have initiated moral behavior information in various subjects that is to be utilized by the learners .<-->N
This is one of the ways the school engages in shaping the discipline of students .<-->N
Also , schools contain well-laid rules and regulations upon which the students are supposed to adore to .<-->N
The teachers enrich the students with the relevant skills that enables them to differentiate between right acts and wrong ones .<-->O
Besides teachersensure that students follow the school rules and punish those who break them .<-->N
Schools that employ high disciplinary measures to students has proved to produce high disciplined individuals .<-->N
This is a clear indication that the future success of a child in most cases depends on the teachers .<-->O
However , this success is usually achieved with close support from parents .<-->O
Teachers responsibility in disciplining children has increased with time due to the parents failure to guide their children appropriately .<-->N
Parents are failing to support discipline for their children whereby they even act in a defensive manner when teachers suggest that their kids are falling short of perfect .<-->O
This reaction from parents has threatened the teacher s responsibility in disciplining children .<-->N
Most of them are prohibiting confrontations from parents by avoiding to punish students thereby tolerating indiscipline cases among them .<-->N
Therefore , the extent to which teachers engage themselves in nurturing the behavior of children greatly depend on the support they get from the parents .<-->O
With much support , teachers will engage in successfully determining the behavior of children -LRB- Storm : School Discipline Starts at Home -RRB- .<-->O
Teachers play a great role in disciplining children and determining their success .<-->N
However , the teachers by their own can not determine the behavior of a child due to various challenges .<-->N
They need to work together with parents in molding the behavior of children .<-->N
The parents should not leave the disciplining responsibility to teachers as they will not execute it on their own .<-->O
Therefore , discipline should start from home whereby , the parents should play a larger part in the determination of discipline of their children .<-->O
Moreover , the extent to which the teachers will contribute to the discipline of children will largely depend on the parent s support .<-->O

----------------------------------------------------------------- Should Parents Be Held Responsible For Their School-going Children 's Discipline Problem ?<-->F
Aug 26 , 2015 20 views0 Likes0 Comments Share on LinkedInShare on FacebookShare on Twitter Now , I say that Parents Should NOT Be Held Responsible For Their School-going Children 's Discipline Problem .<-->F
I have my few reasons for this .<-->F
Children should develop their own Individual Responsibility earlier .<-->N
It should be so , because children should be taught to be less dependent to their parents and to other elders in such a way that they learn to behave by themselves .<-->O
For a child , it is very common to commit mistakes .<-->N
By this , parents should know how to resolve such situations and teach their children do the right thing .<-->O
In this manner , children would be developing their responsibility .<-->N
Children usually have the attitude of Authority Aversion .<-->N
At this point , children usually do n't listen to their parents .<-->N
And so , we can see how parents are not responsible to their children 's discipline problems in school but their children themselves are .<-->O
I just want to point out here that these children are in a certain school to learn and to be educated .<-->O
By it , I mean that children are the only one that should be held responsible for their own actions .<-->O
Failures can never be avoided .<-->N
We can not expect parents to watch over their children all over the day .<-->N
So , we can say the parents never should be held responsible for the reason that they are not always their for their children .<-->O
Even though the parents are the one who knows the children best and the ones who taught and raised up their children but we can expect some parental responsibility failure at this time .<-->O
We can not assure every parents to be teaching every good attitude to their children .<-->O
And so , by these points it can be stated that Parents Should NOT Be Held Responsible For Their School-going Children 's Discipline Problem .<-->N
Do you agree to this ?<-->N
----------------------------------------------------------------- I found this extract which was part of a debate on the above subject .<-->N
So do you agree with the author , or is this subject just another aspect of the nurture/nature debate ?<-->O
The author is Gabriella Samms .<-->N
All parents have a responsibility when it comes to raising their children .<-->N
Beyond the obvious , such as providing them food , water and clothing along with a nurturing environment , they should be expected to teach their children the right and wrong behaviors that are expected or shunned by society .<-->O
This is where the old saying , `` children learn what they live '' , comes into play .<-->N
When a parent feels that what their own child takes part in is beyond their responsibility is the very reason we have thousands of juvenile detention centers filled with youth .<-->O
Responsible parenting involves far more then taking care of a child 's basic needs : it requires a mature , adult mind with a genuine desire to raise a child from birth into adulthood by means of teaching responsible , acceptable behavior .<-->O
This of course takes time , common sense , and a genuine love for the safety and future of ones child .<-->O
In today 's society , parents are consistently using other means , such as childcare centers , schools , video games or the Internet as the sole guiding factors in occupying children 's idle time .<-->N
I do n't believe there is any question as to whether a parent should be held responsible for their minor children 's behavior - it 's a no brainer .<-->O
To argue that question would be as ridiculous as to ask , `` Should parent 's be responsible for giving birth to their own child '' ?<-->O
If the parents are n't to be held responsible , who is ?<-->N
The same is true when asked who should be held responsible for the actions that children have either been taught at home or never taught to begin with .<-->O
Should I be responsible for what someone else failed to do ?<-->N
Parents that tell us they are not responsible for the negative actions of their children are indirectly telling us that they have n't done a vital part of the parenting role : positive teaching .<-->O
It is true that we can not be everywhere are children roam .<-->N
What is possible , if we care enough , is to make sure that our children know right from wrong before they venture out .<-->O
If we as parents create a hostile , un-nurturing , destructive environment that has been proven to have a direct impact on young lives , how on earth can we blame others ?<-->O
If we spend more time away from our children then we do with them , how well do we know them enough to understand what they have learned or what more needs to be taught ?<-->O
If we expect our school systems , daycare centers , friends , child peers , or neighbors to handle our responsibilities , what then is left for us to be responsible for ?<-->N
We may be the best of parents and things can still go wrong .<-->O
We may do all we can to give our children the tools to keep them out of trouble and on the right path in society .<-->O
However , I doubt very highly that statistics taken by detention facilities will disclose that children housed in them had parents fully involved in their lives .<-->O
The tragedy at Columbine is a perfect example of parental negligence .<-->O
We are responsible for what our children do , because they are our children .<-->N
We brought them into this world to become part of society - society did not ask for them .<-->N
To cast off blame onto others or pretend we are n't responsible for neglecting to keep our children safe and society safe from their criminal tendencies is a self-centered , cowards way of saying , `` I just could n't handle it '' .<-->O
Unfortunately , our society wo n't punish a parent for irresponsible teachings or lack thereof .<-->O
Yet , they will expect others to foot the bill when parents fail to fill their parental responsibilities and cause society to pick up the cost of their inadequate or non-existent parental skills .<-->O
If bad parenting comes with no cost attached to it , then society should not be forced to pay for the lack of it either .<-->O
Bad parents should be given the bill .<-->N
Then , at least , they can be held responsible for something .<-->N
Especially when it was n't our choice to take on their 18 year commitment .<-->N

----------------------------------------------------------------- 1 st governmentParents should be held responsible for their school going children s disciplineproblems .<-->N
Thank you Mr/Mdm Speaker .<-->N
Good morning to the honorable adjudicators , my worthyopponents and members of the floor .<-->N
We are standing here today to debate the motion ?<-->N
Parents should be held responsible for their school going children s disciplineproblems ! .<-->N
My name is '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' , and # , as the first speaker of the proposition , wish to put forward many strong arguments to stress the truth of this motion .<-->O
$ efore we go further , let me define our motion for today .<-->N
% ccording to & ` ford % d -LRB- anced -RRB- earner!s * ictionary , Parents is defined as Responsible means ha -LRB- ing a job or duty of doing something or taking care of somebodyor something , so that you may be blamed if something goes wrong .<-->O
Meanwhile , school going children are defined as people who are studying at school , either primary and secondary schools . -RRB-<-->N
astly , discipline problems means % s a whole , our motion today is defined as Members of the floor , % s for today , we , the proposition team would like to highlight the phrase of discipline problems as & ur stand for today is ?<-->O
Parents should be held responsible for their school going children s discipline problems ! .<-->O
This is because family is the core agent of socialisation that shapes our school going children!s attitude .<-->N
% s the first speaker , # will present you our first argument which is parents as thepremier role model .<-->N
& ur second speaker will present you two arguments which are parents as the first knowledge provider , and also parents role to provide children sessential needs . -RRB-<-->O
astly , our third speaker will rebut all three arguments presented by theopposition team .<-->N
& ur strategy as the proposition team is to pro -LRB- e members of the floor on howfamily upbringing by parents do affect on student!s attitudes .<-->O
#n fact , we are going to present a lot of facts and e ` amples to show the relationship of parents !<-->O
responsibility and school going children!s attitude either positi -LRB- e attitudes or negati -LRB- e attitudes With allthese , # am sure + that we , the proposition team will be able to pro -LRB- e that Parents shouldbe held responsible for their school going children s discipline problems ! .<-->O
Members of the floor , & ur first argument is the sufficiency of religious education .<-->N
Generally , it isunderstood that religious education helps to build a system of spiritual , ethical and belief in indi -LRB- idual .<-->O
#n other words , it is useful to generate proper and ci -LRB- ilised beha -LRB- iour . ?<-->N
emember , life without religion is like a body without sole #n this case , family is theagent when students recei -LRB- ed their religious education .<-->N
The sufficiency of religiouseducation lead to students !<-->N
- or e ` amples , if the family teach their children withenough religious education since early age , the potential of student to ha -LRB- e positi -LRB- eattitudes is higher .<-->N
This is supported by a research conducted by ?<-->F
ussen % li from theWorld #slamic Sciences and ?<-->F
ducation 0ni -LRB- ersity stated that there is a clear relationship between parenting style with students !<-->N
#n addition , it is stated that children wholearnt about the belief in God , taught by their their parents ha -LRB- e positi -LRB- es results suchable to cope with stress and be grateful of their life .<-->O
The most solid kind of religious education is one that is re1uired in the family .<-->O
- roe'ample , as for muslim , parents should teach their children to pray as early as 2 yearsold .<-->N
This shows that family has the responsibility to de -LRB- elop on students attitude sinceearly age . -RRB-<-->N
et me gi -LRB- e you a simple analogy , teaching the children about religion is like planting trees .<-->N
3ou must water it from seeds till it grows up , e -LRB- erytime and e -LRB- erydaywithout fail .<-->N
3ou must fertilised it with good source so that later , it will grow up , behealthy and bears fruit .<-->O
Same it goes to our children .<-->N
#f parents planted them withreligious education , for sure , they will grow up as good student , a1uiring good -LRB- aluesssuch as kindness , obedience , dilligence , patience , lo -LRB- e for the truth and justice . .<-->O
So , theway that family teach children determines their attitude .<-->N
#n the other way round , if the family fails to teach their child , e -LRB- en with basicfoundation of religious education , students will prone to ha -LRB- e negati -LRB- e attitude .<-->O
#nsufficient or inade1uate knowledge on religious education will lead students to ha -LRB- elow self4confidence in themsel -LRB- es , misbeha -LRB- iour or be more aggressi -LRB- e in their dailylife .<-->O
#n fact , * atin Seri ?<-->N
osmah Mansor , the 5rime Minister!s wife once said during thelaunch of the 5ermata 6ursery 7entre that 8if a child is raised by their family with theknowledge of religious , then , God willing they will grow up to become someone withgroup principles .<-->O
$ ut , if parents fail to pro -LRB- ide this foundation in their child , it will affectthe child!s de -LRB- elopment in many ways9 .<-->O
so , this also shows that if family fails to instilenough religious education , students !<-->N
de -LRB- elopment are intterupted and will effect on their beha -LRB- iour .<-->N
- or e ` ample , a student without good knowledge of religion might ha -LRB- e less belie -LRB- e in god!s faith .<-->O
% s a result , students will become such emotional persons in life .7 an you get the point : #t shows on how the way family upbringing do determinesstudents attitude . -RRB-<-->O
adies and gentleman , Why do family upbringing determines student!s attitude : This is because , familyis the core of sociali ; ation .<-->N
This means that parents and family members become the main persons in charge since students are born till they grow up .<-->N
5arents are the one who stayand li -LRB- e together with the children , pro -LRB- ide basic needs and know their attitude or beha -LRB- iour well .<-->O
#n addition , parents and family members are the one who become themain source that courage and support their child . ?<-->O
a -LRB- e you e -LRB- er heard that , blood isthicker than water : 3es , this shows that the maternal relationship between family and thechild do bring effects towards their attitude . -RRB-<-->N
adies and gentleman . .<-->N
members of the floor . .<-->N
#n conclusion , family upbringing determines students attitude .<-->N
#n this case , theway of parents instilling religious education in their child lead to their attitude .<-->N
Typically , with enough religious education from the family , students will ha -LRB- e positi -LRB- e results andthose who ha -LRB- e negati -LRB- e attitudes are the ones who come from the family that do notstress on religious education .<-->O
This argument will conclusi -LRB- ely pro -LRB- e to you that ?<-->O
familyupbringing determines students attitude .<-->N
This is because family is the core agent of socialisation that shapes students attitude .<-->N
6ow , listen carefully my dear opposition + ?<-->O
ere we would like to add , a popular saying from $ enjamin - ranklin , once said 8 ?<-->O
ducate your children to self4control , to thehabit of holding passion and prejudice and e -LRB- il tendencies subject to an upright andreasoning will , and you ha -LRB- e done much to abolish misery from their future and crimes9 6ow , please think about it ... $ efore # end , let me reaffirm case < we belie -LRB- e that ??<-->O
andphone usage in school isfair ! .<-->N
This is because , handphone usage has become beneficial tool for students toimpro -LRB- e their studies .<-->N
With that , thank you .<-->N
----------------------------------------------------------------- THE government is considering introducing an Act that would make parents responsible for the actions of their minor children , National Security Minister Dr Bernard Nottage said yesterday .<-->O
# The initiative , according to Dr Nottage , was one of several born from the Crime Listening Forum that was held in August .<-->N
# At a press conference Dr Nottage said : We are looking at introducing a Parental Responsibility Act , which makes parents responsible for the activities and acts of their minor children .<-->O
And we have many minor children now , 13-year-olds , we have 15-year-olds who are being charged with murder .<-->N
# DNA Leader Branville McCartney said he agrees that parents should be held accountable for the acts of their children and even charged before the courts if found accountable .<-->O
# However , he said there are laws on the books currently that allow parents to be charged now .<-->N
# In the Child Protection Act under section 125 an order can be made where a minor is found guilty but the parents are responsible .<-->O
The parents pay a fine , damages or costs .<-->N
Holding parents responsible for their children s actions is a start to combating the crime problem .<-->O
The law is there for it .<-->N
In the Education Act under sections 24 and 25 parents can be held responsible for their children not going to school .<-->F
We have a lot of children that are not in school .<-->N
If they are not doing what they are supposed to as a parent there are consequences for it .<-->N
We do not have a disciplined society , we need to get disciplined .<-->N
We need to ensure there are consequences , he said .<-->O
# We need to catch these things from young .<-->N
A parent won t be saying my good son if they are found liable for their son s actions .<-->N
They won t be saying my good son when they have to pay that fine .<-->N
Those are only two examples .<-->N
The law is there .<-->N
We need to do something .<-->N
# Dr Nottage also said the government is also considering implementing random drug testing in schools .<-->N
# He said : When we did a school programme recently on the use of drugs and alcohol in the school we were concerned that a significant percentage of young people in the school system are exposed to drugs and some are using drugs .<-->O
I attended a teen challenge graduation last week and there was a young boy who was 13 who was referred by the courts because of use and abuse of drugs , we have to do something about this and a suggestion that came from the forum was introducing drug testing .<-->O
# I think we will recommend that there is random drug testing in our schools in order to firstly , cause them to think very seriously about using drugs and secondly to determine who is using and how we can use that information to combat the use of drugs by young people .<-->O
# Mr McCartney said he agrees that drug testing be conducted in schools because drastic times , call for drastic measures .<-->O

`` Primary teachers face attack threat '' -LRB- The Herald -RRB- .<-->N
`` Boy , 4 , who threw brick at teacher among 5400 acts of violence in Scotland 's primary schools '' -LRB- The Daily Record -RRB- .<-->N
Scottish newspapers have reported that there were nearly 8,000 incidents of violence against teachers in Scotland last year , with more than two thirds of them in primary schools .<-->N
Voice General Secretary Philip Parkin commented that there were concerns that some schools were covering up incidents and that the situation may be even worse than the figures suggest : `` There has been an increase in the general level of poor parenting and we have to do something about that .<-->O
`` There are also far more special needs children in mainstream schools and rising numbers of pupils with psychiatric disorders , and staff are n't always trained to deal with them . ''<-->O
Earlier this year , commenting on the Education Select Committee Inquiry into behaviour and discipline in schools in England , he said : `` Schools do need extra support .<-->O
While it seems that persistent low-level disruption in classrooms is probably not getting worse , incidents of extreme aggression , although rare , are increasing in number .<-->O
Disability-related disorders , like psychiatric disorder or attention deficit disorder , are contributing to a deterioration in behaviour .<-->O
`` Alternative arrangements need to be made when poor behaviour is linked with special educational needs .<-->O
Appropriate assessment and early intervention should lead to an effective plan being developed , alongside the resources required for its implementation .<-->O
`` Effective systems need to be in place to support and reinforce positive behaviour .<-->O
Such systems will include a clearly defined behaviour management policy which has the support of parents , pupils and staff .<-->O
Sanctions and rewards need to be applied in a consistent way and supported by regular staff training .<-->O
Challenging behaviour can be addressed most effectively through a multi-faceted approach , incorporating a ladder of sanctions , positive engagement with parents and assistance from external agencies . ''<-->O
`` Discipline is not just the responsibility of the school ; parents also play a key role , both in promoting good behaviour and in being held to account for their children 's misbehaviour .<-->O
`` Anecdotal reports from our members suggest that many teachers feel unsupported when they are subjected to challenging behaviour by pupils .<-->O
In many cases , persistent low-level disruption wears down members of staff to the point at which they have to take sick leave because of stress , anxiety or depression , and , in some cases , such staff become subjected to absence management or capability procedures whilst they are off sick .<-->O
`` The impact of pupils ' challenging behaviour on teachers is such that some teachers experience a loss of confidence or self esteem , become disheartened or lose their motivation to teach , feel that they may lose self-control and behave rashly in a way that they might later regret , apply for jobs in other schools , or even consider leaving the teaching profession .<-->O
`` Although behaviour and discipline issues are a major source of concern for school staff , the sensational portrayal of behaviour in schools by the media -LRB- to increase circulation -RRB- and by politicians -LRB- for political purposes -RRB- are not helpful and give a false impression .<-->O
These headline-grabbing examples of more extreme cases are not indicative of daily school life in general .<-->O
Violent attacks on teachers declined by 40 % in a decade -LRB- according to the British Crime Survey -RRB- .<-->N
Ofsted found that behaviour was ` poor ' in less than 2 % of schools , while the PISA study noted that British pupils were well-behaved in international terms . ''<-->N
The 2009 Behaviour in Scottish Schools Research found that behaviour was improving and that : `` An overwhelming majority of teachers over 90 per cent believe all or most pupils are generally well behaved around the school '' .<-->O
While that is reassuring , low-level indiscipline is a cause for concern for many staff and the latest figures on assaults on teachers in Scotland seem to match Voice 's assertion about the situation in England that , while persistent low-level disruption in classrooms is probably not getting worse , incidents of extreme aggression , although rare , are increasing in number .<-->O
In an article in 2008 for SecEd , Philip Parkin pointed out that : `` Schools are being required to take on more of the responsibilities that belong to parents ; and to provide more of the stability in children 's lives that should be provided by families , blurring the boundaries between education and social service .<-->N
I 'm concerned that the focus is moving away from education towards child well-being . ''<-->O
`` Some children 's only stability in life comes when they 're in school `` The social model that has developed over the last 30 years has changed the nature of parenthood significantly .<-->N
I 'm making no judgement , but the focus on the individual rather than community , changing family structures , the shortening of many relationships , the creation of more step-families , the emphasis on parents working and the consequent perceived devaluing of the role of full-time parent have all changed the way we behave and the character of childhood .<-->O
`` Schools are being asked to monitor things that are n't education obesity , gangs , weapons , drinking , drugs , stolen goods , extremism , and well-being .<-->O
Why are n't parents being asked to take on these responsibilities ?<-->N
Recent Department for Children , Schools and Families work has concentrated more on parents ' rights .<-->N
The more you do for people , the less responsibility they take for themselves and the expectations on parents reduce .<-->N
`` I 'm uncomfortable about the direction society is going .<-->N
Missing from the lives of many disenfranchised teenagers is a functioning parental figure .<-->F
If there 's no functioning parent , there 's no food in the house , no-one washes your clothes , you do n't go to the dentist .<-->N
You live in chaos .<-->N
If you have good care as a child , you can survive almost anything .<-->O
Emotional deprivation is a lethal weapon .<-->N
`` We may deplore some young people 's behaviour , but they 're a minority .<-->N
We may find some pupils difficult a General Teaching Council for England survey suggested this was a major reason why up to 40 per cent of young teachers do n't remain in teaching but we need to see children positively .<-->O
`` Who has created this social climate ?<-->N
Parents have to take their share of responsibility , but so have adults who comprise and vote for governments , control the media , commercialise children , promote the cult of celebrity , or promote greedy , selfish behaviour adults who do n't understand ` community ' .<-->O
`` We need to be aware of adults ' roles and responsibilities in creating the environment in which children grow .<-->O
Schools are expected to compensate not just for parents ' shortcomings , but also for the pressures adult society imposes on young people . ''<-->O
what does the government say about parents ?<-->N
Does it tell them , as it tells schools , what they should be doing for their children ?<-->N
Are they going to be held accountable for the people their children grow into ?<-->N
Of course not but schools are .<-->F
`` The children 's agenda ca n't exist outside of a vision for the whole of society .<-->N
The government needs to articulate what sort of a society it 's trying to create and to share it with us .<-->O
That includes the responsibilities we all bear as adults and parents . ''<-->N
A recent report from Demos found that : `` parents ' drinking and more , parenting style is enormously important .<-->N
The children of parents that combine high levels of attachment and warmth with high levels of discipline are much less likely to drink excessively in later life than children of parents who do not '' .<-->O
Commenting to BBC News on `` Why boys trail further behind girls at GCSE top grades '' , Voice 's Senior Professional Officer -LRB- Education -RRB- Ian Toone said : `` Boys are encouraged to be more active from an early age , whereas the restless movements of baby girls are pacified .<-->O
Hence , girls develop the skill of sitting still for longer periods of time , which is useful for academic pursuits like studying for GCSEs .<-->O
`` Boys tend to cluster together in larger groups than girls and so are more likely to be influenced by peer pressure and to develop a gang mentality , which can militate against GCSE success .<-->O
GCSEs require a degree of solo work and are not viewed as ` cool ' in a laddish culture . ''<-->N
At the same time as this debate on parenting and behaviour , which has been brought into sharp focus this year following the August riots , a new survey commissioned by Turn2us , part of the Elizabeth Finn Care charity : `` reveals the financial pressure parents are facing as they prepare their children for the start of the new school term .<-->O
One in three -LRB- 33 % -RRB- parents surveyed said they are worried about the costs they will incur sending their children back to school in September and over a third -LRB- 34 % -RRB- said they feel that there are too many extras such as school trips , books and sports equipment to pay for when sending children to school . ''<-->O
`` Over one in eight -LRB- 12 % -RRB- parents feel guilty that their child is n't always as well-dressed for school as other pupils and around one in eight -LRB- 12 % -RRB- parents said their child had been bullied in the last 12 months because they did n't have the newest or best clothes or equipment for school .<-->O
Children from families with limited incomes are also not always able to take part in all school activities , and around one in seven -LRB- 14 % -RRB- parents said their child has not being able to attend school trips in the last 12 months because of the costs involved . ''<-->O
Reporting on a separate survey , Children & Young People Now found that : `` Almost a third of parents are to cut back on after-school activities due to the rising cost of living , according to latest research .<-->N
A survey of 2,000 parents , carried out by insurance firm LV , found that 31 per cent are planning to cut back on the number of extra curricular activities they pay for , such as ballet , music and sports lessons as family budgets become increasingly stretched .<-->O
Education and parents ' groups said the findings show the importance of free and affordable after-school clubs to help parents provide interesting activities for children on a tight budget . ''<-->O
Philip Parkin commented that : `` A lot of the activities that will see a drop in participation , such as music and dance lessons , involve private tuition and are expensive .<-->O
`` Schools may not be able to offer that private one-to-one tuition but they are offering a wide range of excellent alternative activities for children .<-->O
`` One of the problems has been getting children to stay behind and take part .<-->N
There is a lot going on after school that is free or very cheap , which more parents should be accessing . ''<-->O
Voice has always been committed to school trips , which are of enormous value in bringing education to life .<-->N
They can provide life-changing experiences and challenges for those who take part in them .<-->N
Safely conducted and properly supervised , education outside the classroom is an integral part of learning and children 's development .<-->O
What do you think ?<-->N
Media hype aside , is behaviour in school -LRB- and outside -RRB- getting worse or just more extreme in a minority of cases while low-level disruption continues as before ?<-->O
How can we address the issue of the minority , but seemingly increasing number , of poor parents ?<-->O
Are schools increasingly taking on the role of parents ?<-->N
If they are , should that be reversed and , if so , who should pick up the pieces when children do n't have functioning parents ?<-->O
Do teachers need more support in the classroom and from parents ?<-->O
Should there be more financial support for school trips and out of school activities ?<-->N
How do we encourage adults to live up to their responsibilities ?<-->N
How do we sustain economic prosperity and growth and employment while encouraging a society that exerts fewer commercial and psychological pressures on children a society where children do n't feel it is important to have the latest trainers or mobile phone and , perhaps more importantly , do n't look down on those who do n't have them or feel ashamed because they do n't possess them ?<-->O
How do ensure a society where children are children , not mini-adults ; where all parents are parents rather than increasingly abnegators of parental responsibility ; where teachers are teachers not surrogate parents ?<-->O
As an earlier blog post put it , `` How do we give our children a good start in life ? ''<-->N
: `` There is no easy answer , and no one answer , to how we square the circle of poor parenting , social deprivation and inequality and poor educational achievement and damaged life chances .<-->O
The debates about nature or nurture , social class and parenting methods have been around for centuries and will continue , but ` How do we give our children a good start in life ? '<-->O
is one of the most fundamental questions of all and one that deserves greater thought and insight from politicians interested only in tinkering round the edges before the next election . ''<-->O
Education Beyond the Classroom Conference -LRB- Cardiff -RRB- , October 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------- How should parents be held accountable ?<-->N
The National Public Radio conducted a telephone survey in 1999 , which randomly interviewed 1,422 adults nationwide .<-->N
When the parents of school age children were asked : How often do you help your children do homework assignments nearly every day , once or twice a week , or less often than that ?<-->N
The answers in percentages were 59 % , 27 % , and 13 % respectively .<-->N
When the parents of school-age children were asked : How often do you meet with your children 's teachers once a month , a few times a year , or only rarely ?<-->F
The answers in percentages were 35 % , 50 % and 12 % respectively .<-->N
When half the sample of parents and non-parents were given a list of problems schools might face and asked to tell if it were a major problem , a minor problem or not a problem at all for the public schools in your community , 55 % indicated that lack of parental involvement was a major problem in their public schools .<-->O
As you can see from this survey , the lack of parental involvement in children s education is a problem for our nation .<-->N
In this article , I will present several things parents should do before their child enters school , what they should do at home and how they should be involved at their child s school .<-->O
Contents 1 Preparation for School 2 Core Values to Success 3 Parental Involvement at Home 4 Parental Involvement at School 5 Conclusion 6 Multiple-Choice Questions 7 Essay Question 8 References Preparation for School Parents should begin preparing their child for school as soon as the child is born .<-->N
Children go through many different levels of physical , emotional , social and intellectual development from the time they are born until they begin school .<-->N
Child Development Info contains a chart that shows the various stages of development a child passes through from ages 2-5 .<-->N
A parent is very important at each of these developments to ensure the child develops normally .<-->O
Parents should spend time everyday reading to their child and making reading fun and exciting .<-->O
Children need time to explore and develop their language skills .<-->N
Parents can do this by reading to the child and asking the child to repeat phrases , as well as teaching the child the alphabet and numbers -LRB- Child Development Institute , 2007 -RRB- .<-->N
It is also the parents responsibility to start socializing their child with other children at an early age .<-->N
This teaches children to get along with others , as a well as key concept such as sharing , learning to listen and take turns .<-->O
Parents should allow their children to explore their creative personalities by providing adequate time to paint , draw , scribble and color .<-->O
These artistic activities help children develop and express their personalities , as well as increasing their imaginations -LRB- U.S. Department of Education , 2005 -RRB- .<-->O
These are all things parents should work with and teach their child before the child starts kindergarten .<-->N
If the parents do not have enough time to work with their child developing his or her skills , then there are many preschool classes available at little or no cost .<-->N
Core Values to Success There are several core values a parent should teach their child at home other than learning academic and language skills .<-->O
One of the first things a parent should begin , even as the child is still an infant , is to get the child used to a schedule .<-->O
The child should have structured days with specific times for eating , playing , and napping .<-->N
As the child nears school age , the parents should try to structure the days similar to what the child will experience in school .<-->O
This will allow the child to be used to routines and the classroom will not come as such a shock to them .<-->O
It is also the parents responsibility to monitor what the child eats , the amount of sleep received , and what is watched on television or seen on the internet -LRB- Bippus , 2005 -RRB- .<-->N
Children need a proper balance of healthy foods and an adequate amount of sleep to properly function .<-->O
This will make learning much easier for the child during school so the child is not sleepy , hungry or lacking energy .<-->O
Children should also be assigned chores appropriate to their age level .<-->N
A preschooler is definitely old enough to help set the table for dinner , place the toys back in the toy box , and helping sorting the laundry .<-->O
This teaches children responsibility , how to follow directions and it improves their physical coordination -LRB- U.S. Department of Education , 2005 -RRB- .<-->N
One of the most important things parents can teach their children is discipline .<-->N
Parents should teach their children right from wrong and that their actions have consequences .<-->O
Children need to be punished fittingly for their misbehavior and they should be able to easily identify right from wrong before they enter school .<-->O
Homework Hints for Parents Assume that your children will have studying to do every night .<-->N
Ask your children if they understand their homework .<-->N
If they do not , work a few examples together .<-->N
Ask your children to show you their homework after the teacher returns it , to learn where they 're having trouble and where they 're doing well .<-->O
See if your children did the work correctly .<-->N
Stay in touch with your children 's teachers .<-->N
Ask about their classes and what they are studying .<-->N
Ask their teachers how you can support what they are studying -LRB- flash cards , spelling , etc. -RRB- .<-->O
Remember , you and their teachers want the same thing to help your children learn .<-->O
Do n't be afraid to get in touch with the teacher if you and your child do n't understand an assignment or if your child is having a great deal of trouble .<-->O
Almost all parents run into these problems , and teachers are glad to help .<-->O
Do n't do your children 's work for them .<-->N
Help them learn how to do it themselves .<-->N
Show your children that you think homework is important .<-->N
If you are at work during homework time , ask to see their work when you get home .<-->N
Praise your children for doing well .<-->N
Make praise a habit .<-->N
Maintain a portfolio of `` best pieces . ''<-->N
Ask your school about tips or guides for helping your children develop good study habits .<-->N
Help older students organize their assignments by recording them on calendars or planners , along with due dates , dates turned in , etc. .<-->N
National Education Association Parental Involvement at Home As important as it is for parents to be involved with their children at home , it is Research has shown time and time again that family involvement in a child s education leads to increased test scores , higher graduation rates , and more opportunities for higher education -LRB- pbs.org , 2007 -RRB- .<-->N
This statement should be enough to encourage all parents to be actively involved with their child s education .<-->O
Parents have to continue to monitor their child s habits , especially on the content and amount of television watched and websites on the internet viewed .<-->O
These forms of entertainment can have a huge influence on your child s life , so it is important the content is age appropriate .<-->O
Another thing to monitor , especially as your child gets older , is attendance .<-->N
Sometimes it is hard for schools to keep check on every student so it is easy for a student to skip out of his classes .<-->O
This is also a core value parents must instill in their children : the importance of being on time and attending classes .<-->O
The most important thing a parent needs to help their child with at home is homework .<-->O
The National Education Association says that teachers use homework to help students understand and retain the work covered from the day s lessons , to see if the students understood what was covered in class , and to help students discover where to find and how to use additional information .<-->O
It is important for parents to help their children with homework to make sure they understand the material and they do their homework so they are prepared for the next day s lesson .<-->O
Parental Involvement at School As important as it is for parents to be involved with their children at home , it is equally important that the parents stay involved at their children s school and with their teachers .<-->N
One of the most significant things a parent should do is stay in constant contact with their child s teachers .<-->O
This includes attending parent-teacher conferences , as well as regular phone calls or notes to ask about your child s progress .<-->N
So often , parents think the only time they need to communicate with a teacher is if something is wrong , but a parent needs to stay informed of all progress .<-->O
Another key way to stay involved is for a parent to volunteer .<-->N
This way a parent knows things that are going on behind the scenes and can possibly better assess the situation at the school .<-->O
Volunteers can see first hand if a teacher is relaying the appropriate amount of content to the students ; so if this is not the case , then parents know they need to spend extra time with their children at home .<-->O
Parents should also vote in school board elections and become a promoter for better education in the community or state -LRB- NEA , 2007 -RRB- .<-->O
Conclusion Parents should be held accountable when it comes to certain aspects of their children s education .<-->O
Parents have responsibilities to prepare their child for school , teach their child core values , and have a steady involvement at home and at school with their child s education .<-->N
Parents have to nurture and guide their child s physical , emotional , social and intellectual development before the child enters school .<-->O
Parents have to teach their child core values that will lead to success , such as discipline , healthy eating and sleeping habits , and how to follow a routine .<-->O
The most important thing for a parent to do at home is to help their child with homework in making sure the homework is completed and the child understands the homework .<-->O
Parents should have a open line of communication with their child s teacher and spend as much time as possible at the child s school by volunteering .<-->O
These are just some examples of how a parent can remain involved in their child s education so they can help their child achieve success .<-->O
Eleven weeks before Election Day we can t know who will win the presidency .<-->O
But we can know with near certainty that voter turnout will be abysmal and that the results will be not so much a mandate as a skewed sampling of about half the electorate .<-->O
Many reforms could increase turnout , from same-day registration to voting on weekends .<-->N
But the most basic is also the most appropriate : making voting mandatory .<-->O
Here s why .<-->N
Mandatory voting would make elections truly valid .<-->O
Protecting the integrity of our elections is the rationale Republicans give for the cynically restrictive voter ID laws they ve enacted in Pennsylvania and elsewhere .<-->N
But if we truly cared about the integrity of elections , we should ensure that they reflect the will of all eligible voters .<-->O
-LRB- MORE : How to Solve the Voter ID Debate -RRB- Second , as William Galston of the Brookings Institution argues , it would temper the polarization of our politics .<-->O
In today s electorate , hardcore partisan believers are over-represented ; independents and moderates are under-represented .<-->N
If the full range of voters actually voted , our political leaders , who are exquisitely attuned followers , would go where the votes are : away from the extremes .<-->O
And they would become more responsive to the younger , poorer and less educated Americans who don t currently vote .<-->O
Third , mandatory voting would prompt more Americans to pay attention to the choices .<-->N
Those of us who lament the decline of civic knowledge generally focus on the supply side of the equation : more civics education .<-->O
A mandate would stimulate the demand side , motivating more voters to learn what they were voting on -LRB- just as a draft makes the drafted motivated to learn what they d fight for -RRB- .<-->O
There are many arguments against mandatory voting ; each reflects a lack of faith in democracy itself .<-->O
One says that increasing the number of uninformed voters will lead to worse policymaking .<-->O
That presumes , however , that policymaking today sets a high-water mark of enlightenment .<-->N
It also sets up a viciously antidemocratic circle : if you don t vote you must be stupid and if you are stupid you mustn t vote .<-->O
-LRB- MORE : Undecided ?<-->N
Election 2012 Is Up to You -RRB- Another critique claims that requiring the vote devalues it , and that compelled voters will protest by voting carelessly .<-->O
But in Australia , where voting became compulsory in 1924 , that s been a marginal issue .<-->N
The existence of a mandate has made voting a meaningful shared national experience .<-->N
Some Republicans will oppose mandatory voting for the reason they now push voter IDs : to win .<-->O
-LRB- Conventional wisdom says the more people who vote , the worse the GOP does -RRB- .<-->O
But if a tactic of disenfranchisement and electorate-amputation makes sense for the party -LRB- which is debatable -RRB- , it is terrible for the country .<-->O
As former director of the Office of Management and Budget Peter Orzsag has pointed out , we can t know what the ultimate partisan impact would be .<-->O
One day Republicans could benefit .<-->N
The most visceral critique is that mandating voting is just un-American .<-->O
Yet jury duty , the draft , going to school , and taxpaying all have been compulsory without being called communist -LRB- OK , three out of four -RRB- .<-->N
At issue is what makes something American and what makes liberty liberty .<-->O
The Revolution and the framing of the Constitution were not about the right merely to be let alone or to do whatever one pleased .<-->O
They were about our liberty to govern and represent ourselves .<-->N
Core to that liberty is electing representatives and voting on public issues .<-->N
That is why the best reason for mandatory voting has nothing to do with today s politics .<-->N
It s about redeeming the central promise of American citizenship .<-->O
Generations marched , fought and died for the right to vote .<-->N
The least we can do now is treat that right like a responsibility .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A true democratic mandate for the government Decrease apathy It 's a model that works Civic duty to vote Cause more people to become interested in politics All the No points Weekend voting would be a more sensible solution The right not to vote Persuasion is more effective than coercion Compulsory Voting Does not enhance democracy People forced to vote are unlikely to vote intelligently .<-->O
What 's the point of voting as politicians do n't listen to the public anyways Voting does not make sense as a rewardable/punishable action .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK A true democratic mandate for the government Low election turn-outs result in a government that does not truly have the democratic mandate of the population .<-->O
Compulsory voting would ensure the governing party has the majority of the country on its side , and better reflect the wishes of the people .<-->O
In my ever so humble opinion voting should be compulsory because I believe -LRB- perhaps somewhat niavely -RRB- that if an individual is forced to vote they would/should make an effort to become more informed on the issues that the various parties are campaigning about , and the issues that affect themselves and their local electorate .<-->O
In Australia -LRB- yes I am Australian but live in the UK -RRB- voting is compulsory .<-->O
That being said , the only compulsory part of the process is showing up and getting your name ticked of the roll .<-->N
What you do in the privacy of the booth is entirely up to you .<-->N
If you dont agree with any of the politicians or parties you vote incorrectly which makes you vote invalid and therefore doesnt count .<-->O
-LRB- stupid but legal -RRB- Forcing people to vote -LRB- against their will , in the case of some Jehovah 's Witnesses -RRB- does not ensure a greater democratic mandate .<-->O
There will be voters who are voting not because they want a particular party to win but simply because they have to vote .<-->O
Bullying tactics should never be used in free and fair elections because they undermine the democratic process , and compulsory voting works only when backed up with fiscal punishment for those who do n't vote .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK Decrease apathy Democracy loses out when people get turned off politics and do n't get involved .<-->O
There is currently no reason for apathetic , non-voting members of the public to be interested in politics .<-->O
If forced to appear at the polls , even to register an abstention vote , the population of the UK would become more involved in the political process , ensuring that parties have to listen to what the people are saying .<-->O
People only become apathetic because the politics of the main parties are not relevant to them .<-->N
Getting rid of apathy does not require reforming the electoral process but making sure the politics of the day engage the public .<-->O
Compulsory voting would merely be addressing a symptom of a wider problem , not the root cause .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK It 's a model that works Australia and other countries already have compulsory voting in a modern , western liberal democracy , so it is not an idealistic aim to make it compulsory in the UK .<-->O
Just because it ` works ' in other countries does not mean that it should be implemented here .<-->O
Further questions are raised about how people will vote when they remain apathetic to the process but are compelled to vote : it can hardly be said to ` work ' when some people may vote for a candidate at random because they are still uninformed and ignorant of policies .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK Civic duty to vote We already hold various functions important to the running of the country as duties in this country , such as the payment of various taxes .<-->O
Voting is arguably the most important civic function because it ensures our democracy continues ; there would be enormous outcry if a government were elected by a small turn-out , which is the way the trend is heading .<-->O
We also can not be seen to be exporting democratic values around the world -LRB- e.g. the Middle East -RRB- when not enforcing those values at home .<-->O
It would be hypocritical to say that voting in your leaders is important abroad , while not caring domestically .<-->O
Voting is not a duty but a right , and as with all rights , people must retain the ability not to exercise it .<-->O
A 40 % abstention vote would be more embarrassing to the winning party than a 60 % turnout , because it highlights further the dissatisfaction of the public with the politics of the day .<-->O
Paying taxes is a duty because everyone uses the services the government provides , such as roads , schools , hospitals and so on , regardless of whether they vote or not , and regardless of which party they voted for .<-->O
It is not hypocrisy because we still offer the democratic process , holding free and fair general elections no later than every 5 years .<-->O
Hypocrisy would be to export democracy while eroding it at home , removing the right to vote and so on .<-->O
This is simply not the case .<-->N
Voting should be compulsory in the UK Cause more people to become interested in politics In todays times a vast majority of people do n't relly care about what 's happening in politics , or simply do n't care enough to vote thinking that their one vote wo n't change anything .<-->O
If there was compulsory voting I believe that more people would take an interest in politics and make their vote count for something .<-->O
Political Education Instead of trying to engage people by force , how about introducing political education in schools and encouraging political conversation .<-->O
How about educating the public on how Westminster affects them ?<-->N
People vote with their feet .<-->N
If they are not interested , they are not interested !<-->N
The government should be trying to engage people by other means , not compulsory voting .<-->O
It may improve low turnout but will not affect what people actually think about politics .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK Weekend voting would be a more sensible solution Simply changing the day elections are held does n't make it any more attractive for people to vote .<-->O
Those people who do n't care wo n't care any more now that an election is on a Saturday , regardless of how much easier it is for them .<-->O
Just as people have better things -LRB- in their opinion -RRB- to do during the week , they will have alternative activities for the weekend .<-->O
Compulsory voting addresses the fact that people simply do n't turn up to vote , which weekend voting does n't .<-->N
If the purpose is to increase turnout , weekend voting would be the more sensible option .<-->N
It gives people more free time in which to vote , and does n't have the problems that coercion brings with it .<-->O
It does n't address the wider problem of apathy , but treats the non-voting problem more acceptably than compulsory voting does .<-->O
Better yet , introduce a public holiday on election days and provide free public transport to and from polling stations .<-->N
Voting should be compulsory in the UK The right not to vote Better to register dissatisfaction with politics by actively registering a non-vote .<-->O
Ballot papers could include an abstention box to properly register this message .<-->N
Spoiling a ballot in order to show that one feels no candidate is suitable , or even that they are dissatisfied with the entire system , sends a message out much more clearly .<-->O
If one simply did not attend the vote at all this could be for many reason - sickness , forgetfulness , pure laziness - and is not making any kind of political statement .<-->O
Voting holds a special place in a democracy ; it is the very foundation of the mandate our elected representatives hold .<-->N
To turn it into something everyone over the age of 18 must do would take away something from that .<-->N
A non-vote -LRB- i.e. staying at home -RRB- sends a more powerful signal of apathy than does a spoilt ballot or abstention vote ; a non-vote says that the citizen is dissatisfied with the entire process , that politics do not address any concern she has .<-->O
A spoilt ballot or abstention vote in a compulsory election , however , merely expresses dissatisfaction with the particular candidates in the constituency , and hides the deeper malaise that may be there .<-->O
Compulsory voting merely sweeps under the carpet the legitimate dissatisfaction many people feel with politics , and will not lead to the regeneration of politics that its proponents suggest .<-->O
Many people will merely vote at random , because ` they have to ' , rather than expressing their apathy .<-->O
A person who conciously elects , in their own mind , that they do not wish to participate in an election process , for whatever reason -LRB- s -RRB- they may have , should not be legally obliged to vote or in any way participate if they choose not to do so .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK Persuasion is more effective than coercion As noted elsewhere , forced attendance would lead to increased political awareness , and an abstention option would offer a ` none of the above ' / ' I do n't mind or care ' choice instead of forcing people to choose a candidate randomly .<-->O
Because the number of voters would increase , politicians would have to be active in engaging with the public and therefore become `` more deserving of the public 's trust '' as you suggest .<-->O
Citizenship classes are irrelevant here ; having them does n't negate the need for compulsory voting .<-->O
Forcing people into voting when they are disengaged from the politic process will exacerbate this problem ; no one likes doing something simply because they have to .<-->O
Election results may be skewed , particularly in marginal seats , by voters who vote at random because they still do n't bother to find out about the candidates , parties and policies involved .<-->O
Rather than forcing people to vote , more should be done to engage the public in political life .<-->N
Westminster is a distant body , detached from real life , and should be made more relevant and more deserving of the public 's trust , for example by releasing full details of MPs ' expenses .<-->O
Citizenship classes should teach the importance of the electoral process , and the history of the suffragette movement , the reform bills of the 19th century and the responsibilities of living in a democracy .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK Compulsory Voting Does not enhance democracy It is highly unlikely that this would be the case across all 600 + constituencies of the UK .<-->O
Furthermore , an abstention vote means ` do not count me ' , not ` do n't elect anyone ' .<-->N
The number of votes in this category therefore do not matter , so long as the real candidate with the most wins the seat .<-->O
-LRB- It would be different if the option were to Re-Open Nominations , but that has not been proposed . -RRB-<-->N
Only where the ballot offers a `` none of the above '' option can compulsory voting being truly democratic .<-->O
However , where this is the case if the `` none of the above '' option achieves over 50 % of the vote does democracy simply fail and the state fall into anarchy ?<-->O
that would be truly democratic , although , hardly pragmatic .<-->O
Consider that in most British elections the majority is not in fact the winning party , but in fact , the non-voters .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK People forced to vote are unlikely to vote intelligently .<-->O
Knowing that turnout would be substantially increased would lead to far more active campaigning by all political parties .<-->O
This in general would raise political awareness and negate the problem proposed .<-->O
Furthermore , an option to ` abstain ' on the ballot paper would accommodate anyone who truly does not wish to have a say in the running of their country .<-->O
Would you force someone to vote even if they were actively uninterested in politics ?<-->N
Even if they were determined to cross a random box ?<-->N
Even if they did not even know the political party in power/opposition ?<-->N
If you force everyone to vote you make it a criminal offence to be incredibly apathetic , so the incredibly apathetic people will merely vote insensibly , counting against the people who are actually voting on the basis of informed opinion .<-->O
In an extreme case , idiots could sway the result of an election .<-->O
If your not even bothered enough about the future of your country 's government to even turn up at the polling booth at each general election , then you do n't get a say , and I think thats actually good .<-->O
Forcing uninterested people to vote is not really democratic its just random .<-->O
You might want to decide who 's in power by throwing the dice instead .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK What 's the point of voting as politicians do n't listen to the public anyways In a compulsory voting system promises are far less likely to broken as everyone will attend at the ballot box , far increasing the chance that the country would rebel against an incumbent government .<-->O
This therefore forces politicians to be more careful and more attentive to the public mood .<-->O
There really is no point voting a lot of the time anyways because they always promise to do this promise to do that but then once they are in office they do what ever the hell they want anyways .<-->O
It is always promises that are broken you ca n't trust politicians they are all bred to lie and miss lead in the end .<-->O
------------------------------------------------- Actually promises are more likely to be broken , because it will dilute interested , informed voters with uninterested , uninformed voters .<-->O
Voting should be compulsory in the UK Voting does not make sense as a rewardable/punishable action .<-->O
Punishing someone for not voting would add insult to injury .<-->O
By not voting , a person has actually made a huge sacrifice they have waived their right to have any say in the running of their country and possibly incurred extreme consequences if the person who is voted in decides to persecute them .<-->O
If a person does n't vote , knowing the full consequences of their actions , it is akin to surrendering in battle an action that , rather than ` lazy ' , is a powerful decision in itself , not something you do without a good reason .<-->O
On the corollary , when a person votes , they are making use of their right .<-->N
They are reaping a reward it is like one free voucher to slightly more political power than they would otherwise have .<-->O
While I am not saying it is an unvirtuous thing to vote I admire anyone who votes for a genuinely ethical party against the advice of a strong majority I do not think rewarding a reward makes a lot of sense .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Eligible voter turnout in the recent 2014 midterm elections has been estimated at 36.2 percent , the lowest since 1942 .<-->N
Voter participation in non-presidential election years is traditionally low , with the most partisan members of the electorate most likely to cast ballots .<-->O
Voter turnout in U.S. presidential elections generally comes in at between 50 and 60 percent of the voting-age population .<-->N
Some observers of U.S. politics make the case that low voter turnout results in more polarization and less legislative compromise .<-->O
Is compulsory , or mandatory , voting the answer ?<-->N
Try Newsweek for only $ 1.25 per week Brookings Institution Senior Fellow William Galston , the Ezra K. Zilkha Chair in Governance Studies , imagines a future in which Americans must vote , or face a penalty .<-->N
In that hypothetical future , Galston sees campaigns appealing to more moderate , swing voters who preferred compromise to confrontation and civil discourse to scorched-earth rhetoric .<-->O
He sees the House and Senate doing serious legislative work and congressional leaders returning power to the committees , where members relearned the art of compromise across party lines .<-->O
According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance , over 20 countries worldwide have compulsory voting , including Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Luxembourg and Singapore .<-->N
In Australia , for example , which has had compulsory voting in federal elections since 1924 , eligible citizens must mark a ballot -LRB- they don t have to choose a candidate -RRB- or pay a small fine , about $ 17 -LRB- U.S. -RRB- .<-->O
Voter turnout is over 95 percent .<-->N
Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Thomas Mann , the W. Averell Harriman Chair in American Governance , called mandatory voting the most promising of a range of reforms designed to increase the size of the electorate and make the parties less polarized .<-->O
It means , he said in a recent Brookings Cafeteria podcast , that political parties and candidates have no incentive to spend huge amounts of money trying to turn out their voters and to demobilize the opposition s voters .<-->O
And yet , Mann recognizes , such a system is in conflict with our values of political freedom .<-->O
Mann and co-author Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute went into more detail about mandatory voting and other reform ideas in their recent book , It s Even Worse Than It Looks : How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism -LRB- Basic Books , 2012 -RRB- .<-->N
In contrast with the former Soviet Union , which boasted a turnout of 99 percent , Mann and Ornstein observed that the Australian system has also elevated the political dialogue .<-->N
Still , they note that most Americans oppose mandatory voting .<-->N
But they may change their opinions , the authors write , after another lengthy period of dominance by political extremes and the divisive discourse , agenda , and outcomes that follow .<-->O
In a 2011 New York Times piece , Galston laid out three arguments in favor of mandatory voting : It would reinforce and strengthen citizenship ; it would strengthen our democracy by leveling disparities among citizens based on education , income , and other factors ; and it would diminish political polarization .<-->O
Recognizing , like Mann , the barriers to enacting such a system in the United States , Galston proposed an experiment in which a half-dozen states from parts of the country with different civic traditions should experiment with the practice , and observers journalists , social scientists , citizens groups and elected officials would monitor the consequences .<-->O
We don t know what the outcome would be , Galston concluded .<-->N
But one thing is clear : If we do nothing and allow a politics of passion to define the bounds of the electorate , as it has for much of the last four decades , the prospect for a less polarized , more effective political system that enjoys the trust and confidence of the people is not bright .<-->O
Galston also addressed the concept , possible barriers and the states experiment in a 2010 Brookings Policy Brief on economic growth and institutional innovation .<-->N
In it he notes one criticism of Australia s system , that a bulge of casual voters , with little understanding of the issues and candidates , can muddy the waters by voting on non-substantive criteria .<-->O
These are called donkey voters in Australia , yet Galston noted that their presence does not appear to have badly marred the democratic process in that country .<-->O
Ultimately , the goal many espouse is full participation by citizens in U.S. democracy .<-->N
Mandatory voting is but one means to this end .<-->N
In 2012 Mann explained a set of alternative policies : Mandatory attendance at the polls , though embraced successfully by Australia and several other democracies , strikes many in the United States as illiberal .<-->N
That is a criticism well worth taking on .<-->O
Every citizen should be registered to vote and provided with the identification certifying that eligibility .<-->N
Primary elections should be structured to encourage the largest possible turnout .<-->O
Election officials should be nonpartisan .<-->N
New electoral rules allowing preferential voting and more direct representation of interests should be considered .<-->O
And a full-scale , frontal attack on the problems of money in politics must be launched : public matches for small donations and effective transparency requirements in the short run ; a constitutional amendment enabling reasonable limits on the flow of money in elections over the long haul .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Democracies across the world risk becoming gerontocracies : government , increasingly for the grey vote , by the grey vote .<-->N
In the recent US mid-term elections , for example , 18 to 29-year-olds constituted just 13 per cent of the electorate ; while in the UK s last general election , the turnout rate for a typical 70-year-old was 36 per cent higher than for a typical 20-year-old .<-->N
- See more at : http://newint.org/sections/argument/2015/04/01/voting-compulsory/#sthash.kDKHQAi5.dpuf Profound inequalities in electoral participation are also evident by class ; UK voters in the highest income bracket were 43 per cent more likely to vote than those in the bottom fifth income group , a five-fold increase since the 1980s .<-->O
Many other European countries have experienced a similar surge in turnout inequality .<-->O
The consequences for democracy and economic equality are dire .<-->N
Politics becomes tilted in favour of high-turnout groups , usually older and wealthier voters , reinforcing a cycle of disaffection and disengagement among the politically marginalized and aiding the one per cent in the process .<-->N
Tinkering around the edges won t revive the idea of democracy as a whole way of life , where each citizen s interest must be accounted for .<-->O
To arrest the hollowing-out of democracy , voting should be made a civic duty for first-time voters , with compulsory attendance at the ballot box .<-->O
This doesn t compel you to vote for a political party there would be a none of the above option .<-->O
Nor does it preclude working to build up more participatory , direct and non-hierarchical forms of democratic life ; compulsory first-time voting is one step among many required to revive moribund democracies .<-->O
However , it will ensure those with the least political voice now have a far greater say in how we are governed in the future , making our democracies more representative , responsive and pluralistic .<-->O
The alternative widening political inequality that entrenches and extends yawning economic and power inequalities is surely something neither of us want .<-->O

It is not that the people s sovereignty has been surrendered to transnationals , or that the arms-and-oil coalition is getting the better of our representatives .<-->O
The state every state has always served the rich and powerful .<-->N
Far from going off course , democracies are simply being exposed for the sham they have always been .<-->O
Elections are a periodic ritual intended to reinforce the illusion of popular rule .<-->O
In fact , they only shuffle around the administrators of capitalism .<-->N
My hunch is that young people are not voting precisely because they are on to this , however viscerally .<-->N
Talk of youth apathy is misguided it does not explain why young people volunteer at similar rates to the population average , or their over-representation in activist movements .<-->O
What we see here is savviness and a healthy cynicism that deserve to be taken seriously .<-->O
In this context , requiring people to vote amounts to compelling them to pledge allegiance to a system they distrust .<-->O
This is not education for civic duty it is the perpetuation of a lie .<-->O
Our strategy as egalitarians should be to accentuate the crisis in the system , even as we build alternatives from below not to help save it from itself .<-->O
Mathew Real change will require enduring struggle .<-->O
A politics of ephemeral protest while waiting on systemic apocalypse is not enough ; after all , Wall Street is occupied again , but now by organized money , and crisis is usually accompanied by retaliation , not revolution .<-->O
Who votes matters .<-->N
Our electorates are getting older and richer , with our politics responding as a result .<-->N
Non-voters have disproportionately borne the brunt of austerity Mathew Electoral politics is one such existing avenue of struggle , however imperfect .<-->O
Using the ballot box does not equate to consenting to the legitimacy of the status quo .<-->N
The answer is not that we shouldn t vote , but that not enough do .<-->N
Social democratic and progressive parties around the world have improved societies far more than those who dogmatically refuse to engage with the present system .<-->O
Surely we agree there is a world of difference between Syriza and Golden Dawn ?<-->N
There is something deeply conservative and defeatist in not recognizing that , nor the role voting played in Syriza s eventual victory .<-->N
You re right that the savviness and healthy cynicism of young people is too quickly dismissed as apathy .<-->O
However , a civil duty to vote in their first election could translate their political energy into enduring pressure for change in the present , and defend better the past gains of collective political action .<-->O
Democracy is , of course , about much more than elections or representative government .<-->N
However , they remain central to it .<-->N
Given that , it makes sense to ensure those most disenfranchised presently are those most represented in future and that abstention is replaced by the full mobilization of the people in democratic life .<-->O
Uri We do seem to be poles apart , but you could at least avoid straw men and caricatures : nowhere was I arguing for dogmatic abstention from voting , nor do I promote ephemeral protest and waiting as political strategies .<-->O
Requiring people to vote amounts to compelling them to pledge allegiance to a system they distrust .<-->O
This is not education for civic duty it is the perpetuation of a lie Uri My argument against making voting compulsory does rest on a principled rejection of the state .<-->O
But this doesn t mean that I necessarily object to any tactical use of the ballot .<-->O
Upcoming elections in my native Israel come to mind : some of my anarchist friends will be voting , if merely to strengthen the remains of the opposition against creeping fascism .<-->O
It may even be possible for an elected leftist government to ameliorate the worst excesses of capitalism , even if post-War history has shown us that a military coup often follows -LRB- and here I genuinely fear for Greece -RRB- .<-->O
But all this is a far cry from the idea that elections should be forced on people , or that they must express their preferences within prescribed channels , whatever other action they take .<-->O
One of the most positive trends in Western society is the abandoning of the politics of demand towards a far deeper opposition to the very principle of hierarchical governance .<-->O
Compulsory voting works against that trend .<-->N
It is not a gateway drug to active citizenship it is a sleeping pill .<-->N
From the occupation of buildings , workplaces and farms to radical co-operatives , local exchange schemes and neighbourhood assemblies , there are hundreds of ways to erode the top-down apparatus that surrounds us , and carve out as much autonomy as we can .<-->O
To be sure , we will need to defend it from both co-optation and repression .<-->O
But self-management and mutual aid not compulsory voting are our best bet if we want to end capitalism .<-->O
Do you ?<-->N
Mathew The question at hand is not how to end capitalism though we clearly disagree about how best to achieve systemic change but how to strengthen the legitimacy of mass electoral democracy .<-->O
Compulsory voting will not achieve the former ; it might well help revive the latter .<-->O
This matters , for who votes matters .<-->N
Our electorates are getting older and richer , with our politics responding as a result .<-->N
Entrenched political inequality reinforces wider social and economic hierarchies ; for example , non-voters generally poorer and younger have disproportionately borne the brunt of austerity .<-->N
Compulsory voting is neither a sleeping pill nor a gateway drug .<-->N
However , it is a mechanism for a slightly more democratic society , where those most marginalized are guaranteed to have their voices heard , electorally at least .<-->O
Moreover , the option to vote for none of the above would provide people with an opportunity to publicly register a rejection of the status quo .<-->O
Hunter S Thompson once said of voting , It ain t much , but it s the only weapon we have against the Greedheads .<-->N
He was half-right .<-->N
As you ve articulated , there are many , often better , forms of political and social action to reduce hierarchy outside of elections .<-->N
However , voting remains an expression of political equality one person , one vote , without distinction that can help build a fairer society .<-->O
Given the illegitimate political and economic hierarchies confronting us , a civic duty to vote in your first election is one more , much-needed , weapon for overcoming present inequalities .<-->O
Uri To strengthen the legitimacy of mass electoral democracy this is precisely where we disagree .<-->O
This discredited system does not need rescuing ; it needs to be abolished .<-->O
We may have one person , one vote , but everybody knows that real political influence comes with pounds and dollars .<-->N
Or is it Swiss francs ?<-->N
Illegitimate hierarchies are dyed into the wool of the state , and the notion of civic duty is nothing but that wool being pulled over our eyes .<-->N
Emma Goldman is usually credited with saying : If voting changed anything they d make it illegal .<-->N
We can paraphrase : if voting were compulsory , its futility would be guaranteed .<-->O
Forcing the young and the poor to vote may temporarily amplify their voices , but that would only cause politicians to listen more intently to the one per cent .<-->O
Sure , people can spoil their ballots .<-->N
But isn t it odd to force them to vote just so they get that opportunity ?<-->O
Millions stay away from the polling booths that is evidence enough .<-->N
Let s find a better story to tell , maybe one about a decentralized society without borders , classes or armies ?<-->O

Politicians and campaigners are gearing up and there is already much excitement - in the Westminster village , at least .<-->O
But as with previous UK elections , millions of voters are expected not to turn out and many more will not be registered to vote in the first place .<-->N
In 2010 , a close election , the turnout was 65 % ; nearly 16 million registered electors did not vote .<-->N
And recent estimates suggest 7.5 million eligible voters are not able to vote because they are either missing from the electoral register or not correctly entered on it .<-->O
The right to vote is the most fundamental tenet of democracy and yet millions do not exercise it .<-->O
So should that right be made into a duty ?<-->O
The senior Labour backbencher , David Winnick , MP for Walsall , is one of a number of politicians supporting more radical moves to get people voting .<-->N
He has introduced a Commons ten minute rule bill - an opportunity to highlight an issue of concern - suggesting that voting should become a `` civic duty '' .<-->O
Mr Winnick pointed out that , at the last general election , `` those who did not vote were larger in number than those who voted for any one of the political parties contesting the election '' .<-->N
`` If you add that figure to those not correctly registered that adds up to more than the votes for the two main parties in the election , '' he told MPs .<-->N
`` I would have thought that should be a matter of much and serious concern to this House whether or not what I am proposing is accepted .<-->O
`` If we want our democracy to flourish , commonsense dictates we should do what we can to get far more people to participate in elections than do at the moment . ''<-->O
Mr Winnick wants the UK to consider a system similar to that in Australia , where people who do not vote , or at least express their intention to abstain , are fined .<-->O
He insists his proposals do not constitute compulsory voting as such .<-->N
Those who have religious or other objections would be able abstain but they would be required to register their abstention by contacting their electoral office in advance or doing so in person at the polling station .<-->O
However , Mr Winnick 's vision does represent a radical move from the voluntary principle on which the British system has been based since universal suffrage was introduced nearly a century ago .<-->O

Obama 's idea in effect , a reverse poll tax on non-voters has cooled as scholars noted that we do not have a national election in America .<-->N
We have 50 state elections , and a constitutional amendment would need approval of three-fourths of those states to make nationwide voting compulsory .<-->O
Even so , with the 2016 presidential run beginning , we can learn much from considering President Obama 's trial balloon ... and from Australia .<-->O
`` Actually , the voting part of ` mandatory voting ' is a misnomer '' in Australia , wrote journalist Eric Weiner .<-->N
`` All Australian citizens over the age of 18 must register and show up at a polling station , but they need not actually vote .<-->O
They can deface their ballot or write in Skippy the Bush Kangaroo -LRB- Australia 's version of Lassie -RRB- or do nothing at all . ''<-->N
Those who do not show up might receive a form letter , which they can resolve with a fine typically of $ 20 .<-->O

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Each year , millions of people fail to vote without reproach .<-->N
Does abstention constitute a citizen 's right not to vote ?<-->N
This article in Australian Journal of Political Science explores whether we have a legal right to a ` no vote ' and if such a right should be protected as fiercely as the right to vote .<-->O
Lisa Hill discusses the ` no vote ' , its implications for society and reaches a firm conclusion .<-->N
Many assert that not voting is a fundamental right , a free expression of political discontent .<-->O
Some go as far as to say that compulsory voting is worse than being denied a vote and a violation of rights .<-->O
Legal cases have been brought in defence of the right not to vote but to date no court has enforced it .<-->O
Should it be true that the right to vote could be waived and hence in itself be a right not to vote and deserve constitutional protection ?<-->O
If so could other basic rights be waived ?<-->O
The minimum wage ?<-->N
Equal employment ?<-->N
Hill argues that legal recognition of the right not to vote is a dangerous path to tread .<-->O
The right to vote is an individual liberty but crucially a collective right at the core of democracy .<-->O
Without political participation from society , government , public interests , security and the very fabric of society would be at stake .<-->O
Vulnerable social groups would lose their voices ; failure to vote could bring political oppression and far greater infringements to personal freedom .<-->O
Hill therefore reasons that voting is a right and a duty ; key to the structure and values of society , a moral responsibility and more important than an individual 's right not to vote .<-->O
So voluntary voting systems can continue to allow abstention , compulsory systems can have exemptions but as Hill states this `` will not and should not constitute the exercise of any particular right , '' and `` doing so would endanger and possibly destroy the system for which it exists : representative democracy . ''<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory voting is a system in which electors are obliged to vote in elections or attend a polling place on voting day .<-->N
If an eligible voter does not attend a polling place , he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as fines or community service .<-->O
As of August 2013 , 22 countries have laws for compulsory voting and 11 of these 22 countries enforce these laws in practice .<-->N
-LSB- 1 -RSB- Contents 1 History 2 Arguments for 3 Arguments against 4 Research 5 Current use by countries 5.1 Enforced 5.2 Not enforced 6 Past use by countries 7 Measures to encourage voting 8 See also 9 References 10 External links History Athenian democracy held that it was every citizen 's duty to participate in decision making , but attendance at the assembly was voluntary .<-->O
Sometimes there was some form of social opprobrium to those not participating .<-->N
For example , Aristophanes 's comedy Acharnians 17 22 , in the 5th century BC , shows public slaves herding citizens from the agora into the assembly meeting place -LRB- pnyx -RRB- with a red-stained rope .<-->N
Those with red on their clothes were fined .<-->N
-LSB- 2 -RSB- This usually happened if fewer than 6,000 people were in attendance , and more were needed for the assembly to continue .<-->N
In fact , tools that enforced assembly attendance may have been inspired by Solon 's law against neutrality -LSB- clarification needed -RSB- and acted as a precedent of ostracism ; like with ostracism , the obligation to participate was generally aimed at preventing the subversion of democratic politics by oligarchic or tyrannical forces .<-->O
-LSB- 3 -RSB- Arguments for Supporters of compulsory voting generally look upon voter participation as a civic duty , similar to taxation , jury duty , compulsory education or military service ; one of the ` duties to community ' mentioned in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights .<-->O
-LSB- 4 -RSB- They believe that by introducing an obligation to vote , it helps to overcome the occasional inconvenience that voting imposes on an individual in order to produce governments with more stability , legitimacy and a genuine mandate to govern , which in turn benefits that individual even if their preferred candidate or party is n't elected to power .<-->O
Compulsory voting systems can confer a high degree of political legitimacy because they result in high voter turnout .<-->O
-LSB- 5 -RSB- The victorious candidate represents a majority of the population , not just the politically motivated individuals who would vote without compulsion .<-->O
-LSB- 6 -RSB- Compulsory voting also prevents disenfranchisement of the socially disadvantaged .<-->N
Australian academic and supporter of compulsory voting , Lisa Hill , has argued that a prisoner s dilemma situation arises under voluntary systems for marginalised citizens : it seems rational for them to abstain from voting , under the assumption that others in their situation are also doing so , in order to conserve their limited resources .<-->O
However , since these are the people who are in most need of political representation , this decision is also irrational .<-->O
Hill argues that the introduction of compulsory voting removes this dilemma .<-->N
-LSB- 7 -RSB- In a similar way that the secret ballot is designed to prevent interference with the votes actually cast , compelling voters to the polls for an election reduces the impact that external factors may have on an individual 's capacity to vote such as the weather , transport , or restrictive employers .<-->O
-LSB- citation needed -RSB- If everybody must vote , restrictions on voting are easily identified and steps are taken to remove them .<-->N
If voters do not want to support any given choice , they may cast spoilt votes or blank votes .<-->O
According to compulsory voting supporters , this is preferred to not voting at all because it ensures there is no possibility that the person has been intimidated or prevented from voting should they wish .<-->O
-LSB- citation needed -RSB- In certain jurisdictions , voters have the option to vote none of the above if they do not support any of the candidates to indicate clear dissatisfaction with the candidate list rather than simple apathy at the whole process .<-->O
-LSB- citation needed -RSB- Another perceived benefit of the large turnout produced by compulsory voting is that it becomes more difficult for extremist or special interest groups to get themselves into power or to influence mainstream candidates .<-->O
Under a non-compulsory voting system , if fewer people vote then it is easier for lobby groups to motivate a small section of the people to the polls and influence the outcome of the political process .<-->O
-LSB- citation needed -RSB- The outcome of an election where voting is compulsory reflects more of the will of the people -LRB- Who do I want to lead the country ? -RRB-<-->O
rather than reflecting who was more able to convince people to take time out of their day to cast a vote -LRB- Do I even want to vote today ? -RRB- .<-->O
Other perceived advantages to compulsory voting are the stimulation of broader interest politics , as a sort of civil education and political stimulation , which creates a better informed population .<-->O
Also , since campaign funds are not needed to goad voters to the polls , the role of money in politics decreases .<-->N
High levels of participation decreases the risk of political instability created by crises or charismatic but sectionally focused demagogues .<-->O
-LSB- 6 -RSB- There is also a correlation between compulsory voting , when enforced strictly , and improved income distribution , as measured by the Gini coefficient and the bottom income quintiles of the population .<-->O
-LSB- 8 -RSB- Arguments against Voting may be seen as a civic right rather than a civic duty .<-->O
While citizens may exercise their civil rights -LRB- free speech , right to an attorney , etc. -RRB- they are not compelled to .<-->O
Furthermore , compulsory voting may infringe other rights .<-->O
For example , Jehovah 's Witnesses -LSB- 9 -RSB- and most Christadelphians believe that they should not participate in political events .<-->O
-LSB- citation needed -RSB- Forcing them to vote ostensibly denies them their freedom of religious practice .<-->N
In some countries with compulsory voting , Jehovah 's Witnesses and others may be excused on these grounds .<-->N
If however they are forced to go to the polling place , they can still use a blank or invalid vote .<-->O
Similarly , compulsory voting may be seen as an infringement of Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which guarantees freedom of political opinion and thus the right of citizens to believe in a political system other than a democratic one , such as an absolute monarchy .<-->O
However , it may also be argued that citizens may legitimately be required to vote since the right to believe in a different political system does not conflict with the obligation to conform with legal requirements of the system in place .<-->O
-LSB- citation needed -RSB- Another argument against compulsory voting , prevalent among legal scholars in the United States , is that it is essentially a compelled speech act , which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak .<-->O
-LSB- 10 -RSB- Some do not support the idea of voters being compelled to vote for candidates they have no interest in or knowledge of .<-->O
Others may be well-informed , but have no preference for any particular candidate , or may have no wish to give support to the incumbent political system .<-->O
In compulsory voting areas , such people often vote at random simply to fulfill legal requirements : the so-called donkey vote may account for 1 2 % of votes in these systems -LSB- citation needed -RSB- , although due to the law of large numbers , this should have no effect on the result .<-->O
Similarly , citizens may vote with a complete absence of knowledge of any of the candidates or deliberately skew their ballot to slow the polling process or disrupt the election .<-->O
The Australian system of preferential voting means a person 's vote usually ends up favouring one of the two main political parties , even though the voter may not wish to advantage either .<-->O
Former Australian opposition leader Mark Latham urged Australians to lodge blank votes for the 2010 election .<-->N
He stated the government should not force citizens to vote or threaten them with a fine .<-->O
-LSB- 11 -RSB- At the 2013 federal election , despite the threat of a non-voting fine of up to $ 170 , -LSB- 12 -RSB- there was a turnout of only 92 % , -LSB- 13 -RSB- of whom 6 % lodged either informal or blank ballot papers .<-->O
-LSB- 14 -RSB- In the corresponding Senate election , contested by over 50 groups , -LSB- 15 -RSB- legitimate manipulation of the group voting tickets and single transferable vote routing resulted in the election of one senator , Ricky Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party , who had initially received only 0.5 % of first-preference support .<-->O
-LSB- 16 -RSB- The system was accused of undermining the entitlement of voters `` to be able to make real choices , not forced ones and to know who they really are voting for . ''<-->O
-LSB- 17 -RSB- Research A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced finds that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referendums by up to 20 percentage points .<-->O
-LSB- 18 -RSB- Current use by countries As of August 2013 , 22 countries were recorded as having compulsory voting .<-->N

-LSB- 39 -RSB- -LSB- 40 -RSB- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Obama suggested it 's time to make voting a requirement .<-->F
`` Other countries have mandatory voting , '' Obama said Wednesday in Cleveland , where he spoke about the importance of middle class economics , and was asked about the issue during a town hall .<-->N
`` It would be transformative if everybody voted -- that would counteract money more than anything , '' he said , adding it was the first time he had shared the idea publicly .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON WEDNESDAY , while Barack Obama was suggesting to an audience in Cleveland that it might be a good idea to make voting mandatory , my wife was being prevented from voting .<-->O
My wife , a Dutch citizen , is away on a business trip , so for Wednesday 's elections to the Netherlands ' provincial assemblies she had filled out a proxy voting form .<-->N
The proxy form states that a voter can designate `` another voter '' to cast their ballot .<-->N
Without giving the matter much thought , she indicated that the `` other voter '' who would cast her ballot would be me .<-->O
That , as I discovered at the polling station , was not allowed .<-->N
I could cast my wife 's proxy ballot in the waterschapsverkiezingen , which choose the boards that run the country 's dikes and canals , but not in the provincial-assembly elections , because I was not eligible to vote in them myself .<-->N
The distinction had not occurred to either of us , and the proxy form did not warn us of a problem .<-->N
But the injury is pretty minor , and not really the point .<-->O
The point is that this is the way that barriers to voting tend to emerge .<-->N
They create just enough of a hurdle that some significant percentage of voters will fail to clear it .<-->O
It is not such a terrible thing to demand that voters read eligibility requirements carefully , and contact authorities if questions arise .<-->O
But it creates just enough of a nuisance that some voters , whether because they have lower reading comprehension , are more distracted , are in an unusual legal situation -LRB- such as having a non-citizen husband -RRB- , or what have you , will end up not voting .<-->O
One would hope that the state would be reducing these sorts of barriers to the lowest possible level .<-->O
Instead , for the past decade in America , the state has been raising them higher and higher , because barriers to voting confer partisan advantages .<-->O
There are a number of arguments one can make in favour of mandatory voting .<-->N
I am inclined to favour it , but mainly for second-order reasons : a state that legally requires everyone to vote must also make it possible for them to do so .<-->O
The most important goal to which mandatory voting could contribute would be to shift the burden of ensuring that citizens can vote from the individual to the state .<-->O
Being registered to vote ought to be thought of as a right , rather than a duty or a lifestyle option .<-->O
It should be the state 's business , not the citizen 's , to ensure that every citizen is issued with a voter card .<-->N
The state taxes us , drafts us in time of war , enforces laws restricting our actions , and arrests us when we break them .<-->N
By what right does it do all of this if it has not also made voting for these officers as widespread as possible ?<-->O
What right does the state have to erect any barrier , however trivial , to citizens participating in the election of those who will govern them ?<-->O
It makes perfect sense for the state to demand that I go through the bother of getting a licence in exchange for the privilege of driving a car .<-->O
But if the state wants me to show an identification card to exercise my right to vote , it should be required to mail me one .<-->O
For a cautionary tale on what suppressing voters does to democratic legitimacy , there is the 18th-century Polish commonwealth , that grand model of democratic collapse .<-->O
The entire nobility , or szlachta , was entitled to vote for the king , but to do so one had to travel to Warsaw and take part in the days-long election deliberations .<-->N
The democratic backing of the noble class should have provided the Polish crown with unrivalled consensus and strength , but as time went on the elections were increasingly monopolised by the wealthiest and most powerful magnates , and the trip to Warsaw ceased to seem worth it for anyone else .<-->O
In 1574 the first royal election drew 40,000 szlachta ; by 1674 that had fallen to 5,000 .<-->N
Low turnout figures were in the interests of powerful noble magnates since they made it easier for them to control elections , but the long-term result was to hollow out the democratic consensus and undermine national strength , ultimately contributing to Poland 's partition .<-->O
As in America , one might argue that whether a citizen decided it was worth it to exercise his vote was a matter of personal choice .<-->O
But this misses the point that the rich and the poor were involved in an iterative game in which lowering turnout served the interests of the rich , even though it weakened national governance .<-->O
The final issue has to do with the character of the state in which one wants to live .<-->N
One can argue that whether citizens want to vote or not is their own business .<-->O
Yet as voter participation drops , a self-selected minority determines who runs the country , and policy increasingly reflects their interests .<-->N
For often poorer , younger and non-white voters , the reality that their votes do little to influence policy creates a widening gap between the effort required to vote -LRB- higher in any case than for wealthier voters -RRB- and the negligible payoff , feeding a vicious circle of low participation .<-->O
I do not like this kind of society .<-->O
I prefer societies where everyone 's consent has been painstakingly solicited , and where people encounter each other as full political equals , not just in theory but in fact .<-->O
The more barriers to voting rise in America , and the further voter participation falls , the less it looks like that kind of society .<-->O
Mandatory voting might not be the best way to address these issues .<-->O
-LRB- It probably would n't address the problem I encountered in the Netherlands ; Australia , where voting is mandatory , exempts citizens who are abroad rather than making it particularly easy for them vote . -RRB-<-->O
It is , in any case , a political non-starter .<-->N
But I think the suggestion pushes in the right direction .<-->O
reality television does more harm than goo My maternal grandfather , Don Rose , was an obsessive journal-keeper when he was young .<-->O
For some years beginning in his late teens , he would record his thoughts and activities in minute detail not just that he went shopping , but also what he bought and how much it cost .<-->O
-LRB- Fare , town : .50 ; suit cleaned & mended , 2.05 ; socks , .25 ; collars , .25 . -RRB-<-->N
One journal entry , from around 1910 , mentions a date he had been on .<-->N
It s where he took the young lady that is interesting : They went to a debate , one on the proposition that commission form of municipal government is an improvement on the present system .<-->O
It s becoming hard enough to imagine a guy taking a gal on a date of any kind here in the age of casual hooking up , but a date to a debate ?<-->O
Especially an old-fashioned one about ideas , not presidential politics ?<-->N
I did not have a date with me Tuesday night when I attended just such a debate at the Crosby Street Hotel in SoHo , but I wouldn t have felt the need to apologize to her if I had .<-->O
It was a darned entertaining evening , more laughs than most movies , less morning-after arm stiffness than bowling .<-->O
And the question under discussion was every bit as urgent as how to structure municipal government : Does reality television do more harm than good ?<-->O
Two-man teams , one from Harvard , one from Columbia , took on the issue , Harvard -LRB- Andrew Laing and Allen Ewalt -RRB- arguing that yes , it does , and Columbia -LRB- Rohan Jotwani and Reid Bagwell -RRB- contending that it doesn t. I thought both sides were pretty convincing .<-->O
But the judges gave it to Columbia on a 2-to-1 vote .<-->N
The proposition said reality television , but the debaters focused almost exclusively on one stripe of reality TV : the watch people live their lives badly one , which includes Jersey Shore , The Real World and such .<-->O
-LRB- The debate was hosted by Halogen TV , a relatively new channel that emphasizes a more reputable , socially conscious type of reality-based series . -RRB-<-->N
Mr. Laing began , arguing that reality television saps ad dollars and viewer time that could be used more nobly ; that these shows are bad for the people who go on them -LRB- You end up looking like Omarosa , a notorious reality-show villain -RRB- ; that they set terrible examples for those who live their lives based on what they see on the tube .<-->O
Snooki and the Situation those Jersey Shore freak shows could very much be multimillionaires , and I don t think that s a good message to send , Mr. Laing said .<-->O
Mr. Bagwell , arguing the other side , noted that bad role models on television are not limited to reality shows there are plenty in scripted TV as well .<-->O
He called out the elitism inherent in the question : Ivy League people think reality TV is kind of lowbrow .<-->O
And , dropping a reference to a fascinating-like-a-train-wreck A&E show , he said , I do think there s some societal value that we now know all about hoarding .<-->O
Mr. Ewalt , in the rebuttal round , said that reality shows reinforce harmful stereotypes .<-->N
He also noted that despite the genre s name , they are actually anti-reality ; those on the shows and those who aspire to be on them adopt made-for-the-camera mannerisms and mind-sets .<-->O
It creates this pressure for people to behave inauthentically , he said .<-->N
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Jotwani , though , contended that reality shows have the power to burst stereotypes as well as reinforce them , citing Susan Boyle , the homely singer who became a star after a performance on Britain s Got Talent .<-->O
That s something that only happens on reality TV , he said .<-->N
And Mr. Bagwell suggested that there s no proof that people at large act idiotically , criminally or whatever because they see that behavior on television .<-->O
Crazy people will do crazy things with or without reality TV , he said .<-->O
Back and forth they went , like great boxers slugging it out , though this was somewhat disappointing no actual slugging took place .<-->O
Still , it was all pretty invigorating , and I would propose a nationwide revival of debating , not just as a dating destination , but as a way to determine what we should do to bring order to the chaos that is television today .<-->O
We ought to stage formal debates like the one I saw , broadcast them nationally , and let viewers vote reality-competition-show style , of course on who won .<-->O
Then television would be mandated to conform to the results .<-->N
In addition to the proposition I saw debated , here are a few that deserve well-reasoned discussion and action : Should there be a limit on how many talk-show appearances someone can make to plug a new movie , show or album ?<-->O
-LRB- I m talking to you , Radiohead . -RRB-<-->N
Do 24-hour news channels do more harm than good ?<-->N
Does Piers Morgan do more harm than good ?<-->N
Should a 50-year moratorium be imposed on new police procedurals ?<-->N
Are hospital shows featuring imbalanced doctors creating a public health crisis because they make people afraid to seek medical care ?<-->O
-LRB- I m talking to you , Hugh Laurie . -RRB-<-->N
Should the women from The View be cast in a reality-show version of the old Twilight Zone episode where one man bets another that he can t go a year without speaking ?<-->N
Are hoggers , ghost-chasers , hillbilly handfishers , hairy bikers , disobedient pets , garrulous cake bakers and obnoxious residents of New Jersey overrepresented on American television and thus giving a misimpression of our species to those on other planets who may be receiving the TV signals emanating from our satellites , inevitably leading to an intergalactic attack intended to exterminate us ?<-->O
Was television better off when it had only three networks ?<-->N
Of course , if we had only three networks , we still wouldn t know a thing about the hoarding epidemic .<-->O
Correction : October 12 , 2011 A picture caption on Saturday with a Critic s Notebook article about a debate on whether reality television does more harm than good , using information from the host of the event , Halogen TV , reversed the identities of two participants .<-->O

------------------ Reality TV causes more harm than good . ?<-->N
April 29 , 2014 ?<-->N
Uncategorized Reality TV causes more harm than good .<-->N
By Reality TV I am talking about entertainment shows that are produced to make the audience believe that they are real , even if it s totally scripted , for example , Big Brother , The Bachelor/Bachelorette , The Hills , or Geordie and Jersey Shore .<-->O
I personally love watching Keeping up with The Kardashians as much as the next average teenage girl does ; but what s the point of watching these television programmes ?<-->O
And what is it really putting into our brains ?<-->O
I have found a definition of Reality Television online from oxforddictionaries.com .<-->N
Television programmes in which ordinary people are continuously filmed , designed to be entertaining rather than informative .<-->O
Not all reality television programs are sending negative influences , but many are .<-->N
No matter how entertaining it might be , I believe that reality TV does more harm than good .<-->O
When you find out about the amount of scripting that goes on and how much of the situation we actually see , it can barely be considered reality anymore , it could almost be considered as just another soap opera .<-->O
This doesn t matter though , because the audience still believes it s real and that the crazy things happening on in the TV show are actual events happening to the people involved , or believe that it happens to the extent it s portrayed through the TV as .<-->O
When people inaccurately believe something they start to apply the reality which they see on TV to their own life .<-->O
This can often be very unrealistic and cause you to really wonder and ask why your life hasn t turned out the same way that Lauren Conrad s from your favourite reality TV show The Hills has .<-->O
Reality TV has a negitive influence on society .<-->N
The first reason these TV shows negatively influence society is the way the TV shows promote bad morals .<-->O
This is particularly shown in Jersey Shore , Geordie Shore and any ones similar .<-->N
These TV shows thrive off the stars doing things like cheating on their significant others , fighting -LRB- verbally and physically -RRB- with housemates , friends or enemies and some of them go under the knife for cosmetic surgery to up their ratings .<-->O
They do these things , that they don t need to do at all in order to get more people to view the program and it has become more and more common in the TV shows for them to fight and cheat because the more they do it the more ratings they get .<-->O
I don t believe that this kind of behaviour should be put openly into society they way it is through reality TV .<-->O
Younger people watching the shows see this and will think that being in your late teens and early 20 s is all about getting with people , cheating , implants and fighting .<-->O
A large number of 9.2 million cosmetic surgeries have been performed as a result of people watching reality TV .<-->N
-LRB- anhoward.wordpress -RRB- My second point is that the people in reality TV shows are people who have been chosen by producers .<-->N
The producers of the programs will choose people who are likely to clash with each other .<-->O
After they have chosen a handful of good looking self publicists they place them into a very unnatural environment , for example , the Big Brother , Geordie Shore or Jersey Shore house .<-->O
They then give them jobs or challenges which will provoke them to behave strangely .<-->O
This ensures that the audience will enjoy and find entertainment out of the show .<-->O
-LRB- iDebate.org -RRB- My next point is that the reality TV shows , Teen Mom and 16 & Pregnant have been made to make young girls think that if you get pregnant at a young age you re going to get a TV show out of it and it will be fun or easy raising a baby .<-->O
A study shows that a lot of girls who have low self-esteem between the ages 13 and 18 , have taken it into consideration to get pregnant just so they can get on TV or have their own reality TV program .<-->O
These shows influence the young girls to think that getting pregnant would make them more popular at school and of course it makes them think they will get pregnant and be able to be on TV .<-->O
To me , 13 year old girls shouldn t be considering getting pregnant to boost their self-esteem , and this is what s happening in our world , a major cause being these reality TV shows .<-->N
My fourth point is about the people in reality TV .<-->N
One of the biggest reality TV stars of today is Snooki -LRB- Nicole Polizzi -RRB- from Jersey Shore and of course the other cast members of this TV show .<-->N
A lot of people watching this show are people younger than the people in it and when they watch it , it will be putting into their brains that when they re that age thats what life will be like or making them think that , that is the way all Italian-Amercians are and that its the way all people live in New Jersey .<-->O
Some teenagers of today actually look up to these stars because they see how much of a great life they have and they get to be on TV for doing literally nothing .<-->O
Are these people good role models for the youth of today ?<-->N
If you told you parents that you wanted to be just like Snooki when you were older would they approve of it ?<-->O
Do parents want their kids to aspire to be impure , rude and beauty obsessed ?<-->O
I don t think most parents do but it s what will happen if they re exposed to this material day by day and are constantly given the idea that a well lived life is lived that way .<-->O
-LRB- debate.org -RRB- In the voyeurism of Reality TV , the viewer s passivity is kept intact , pampered and massaged and force-fed Chicken McNuggets of carefully edited snippets that permit him or her to sit in easy judgment and feel superior at watching familiar strangers make fools of themselves .<-->O
Reality TV looks in only one direction : down .<-->N
James Wolcott In conclusion , watching reality TV is causing more harm to society than it is good .<-->N
By watching these television shows we start to think that our life should be how the stars lives are and wonder why it isn t , todays teenagers are beginning to think of life as it s not and the role models that are being set for them aren t very good people to be looking up to as young people .<-->O

-------------- Children reality shows : Doing more harm than good Number of reality shows on television including children 's reality shows , which have children participating as contestants , has increased .<-->N
Many of these shows get lapped up by the audience , but there is a grim reality of children 's reality shows .<-->N
Child psychologists and psychiatrists inform that the pressure and stress on participating children of reality shows is terrible and pressure has proved fatal too in some cases .<-->O
- See more at : http://www.merinews.com/article/children-reality-shows-doing-more-harm-than-good/15899713.shtml#sthash.pWocN9PI.dpuf Read more at : http://www.merinews.com/article/children-reality-shows-doing-more-harm-than-good/15899713.shtml&cp Many educationists and psychologists deem that reality shows for children is an undesirable concept .<-->N
Children 's psyche is tender and fragile and often they are unable to handle the criticism and failure , leading to low self-esteem and failed childhood .<-->O
Often , children take public humiliation , harsh criticism or rude remarks very seriously resulting into self-harm .<-->O
Even those children , who succeed in reality shows , when they achieve sudden and short-lived fame , become arrogant and their growth as normal children stops .<-->O
The fame through reality shows fades fast and even the successful children find it difficult to cope up with the situation in which there is no more the limelight and adulation .<-->O
At times , parents too put a lot of pressure on their kids to participate in the reality shows because of the allurement of the big prize money .<-->O
They employ experts to coach their children to push them harder and perform better .<-->N
Consequently , children loose out their childhood .<-->N
Also , during the contest , when children do not come up to expectations , they become afraid to face parents and public both .<-->N
Anyway , only one child succeeds in the last , but rest all , in a large number receive a stigma of failure .<-->O
I too feel that children 's reality shows distorted reality of life and they are against the tenets of development psychology .<-->O
They seem to doing more harm than good .<-->O

Grabbers : 1 -- Did you know that research indicates that regular reality TV viewers emphasize being mean and/or lying to get ahead ?<-->O
A higher percentage of these girls as compared to their non-viewing counterparts claim that sometimes : You have to lie to get what you want -LRB- 37 % vs. 24 % -RRB- ; Being mean earns you more respect than being nice -LRB- 37 % vs. 24 % -RRB- ; and You have to be mean to others to get what you want -LRB- 28 % vs. 18 % -RRB- .<-->O
2 -- In a study , those who viewed reality TV regularly were more focused on the value of physical appearance .<-->N
The study found that girls who view reality TV regularly are more focused on the value of physical appearance .<-->O
72 % say that they spend a lot of time on their appearance , vs. the 42 % of non-viewers .<-->N
More than a third , 38 % , say they spend a lot of time on their appearance , vs. the 42 % of non-viewers .<-->N
They would rather be recognized for their outer beauty than their inner beauty -LRB- 28 % vs. 18 % of non-viewers -RRB- .<-->O
Conclusion : You counter arguments about reality/contestant shows like American Idol or Americas Got Talent as saying while they 're not harmful , they are n't good either .<-->O
So you have the best of reality TV having no effect , I mean , its just entertainment like any other show - neither good nor bad effects but the worst of reality TV clearly does more harm ; therefore , overall , the entire genre of reality TV does more harm to society .<-->O
Refutations : Reflect on bad acts -LRB- consequences -RRB- -- Refuted by first point .<-->N
Give people chances to shine -LRB- American Idol -RRB- -- Although some of these contestants may be given a chance to shine , the majority of them end up being embarrassed because of their auditions .<-->N
When these children or adults fail , they wo n't be happy .<-->N
Most of the time , America does not , in fact , have talent .<-->O
Good shows -LRB- Animal Planet -RRB- -- There are so many shows which have negative impacts on our societies .<-->N
Furthermore , these shows are the shows which are watched more than the Animal Planet shows .<-->N
Impressionable viewers who watch Jersey Shore are 38 % more likely to have negative opinions about Italians and young adults .<-->O
This is sourced from the Wall Street Journal .<-->N
Is this positive ?<-->F
Not at all .<-->N
There are more negatives shows than positive shows , and more people watch these negative shows .<-->N
Thus , the harm outweighs the good when it comes to reality TV .<-->N
Entertainment -- Although these shows can be used for entertainment , the harm that we 've shown has outweighed this simple , small amount of entertainment .<-->N
Form of escapism -- Since it is a form of escapism , people may think that they should copy the reality TV stars .<-->O
Then , they will copy the bad acts done by the people .<-->O
Elaborate with first point .<-->N
Rights -- We are not arguing that it should be banned .<-->N
We are simply showing how the harm outweighs the good , as we have proven .<-->O
Assertion : Reality TV shows give people chances to shine and show their true talents .<-->O
Reasoning : There are many shows , such as America 's Got Talent and American Idol , which allow normal people such as you or me , to show off their talents .<-->O
These allow people with unrecognized talents to gain fame and wealth when they never would have been able to .<-->O
This is even better than a lottery .<-->O
Evidence : There are tons of current singers who became famous and rich just because of American Idol , such as Kelly Clarkson , Adam Lambert , Kris Allen , Chris Daughtry , Clay Aiken , Rubben Studdard , Jordan Sparks , Carrie Underwood , Fantasia Barrino , Jennifer Hudson , Kellie Pickler , Katharine McPhee , Elliott Yamin , David Cook , and David Archuleta .<-->O
All of these singers who would n't ever have been famous now are world renowned thanks to the reality tv show ; American Idol .<-->O
These reality tv shows give the average American hope in a debt-stricken country such as our own .<-->N
Another example is Britan 's Got Talent .<-->N
Susan Boyle , a not-well known opera singer until her premiere on Britan 's Got Talent , is now world famous because of her singing on Britain 's Got Talent .<-->N
She is now a multi-millionaire and has gained a lot of fame .<-->N
Impact : Many Americans and British people will have hope in a terrible economy .<-->O
When everything bad is happening , the only good left is hope .<-->O
Reality TV is the sliver of sun that is trying to break through the impassable barrier .<-->N
Reality TV is our only joy in our depressing economy .<-->O
Source : The Wall Street Journal 2 .<-->N
Assertion : The shows do n't do any harm because all one has to do is turn it off .<-->N
Reasoning : Reality TV itself ca n't make the children addicted to themselves .<-->N
Really , bad or negligent parenting is at fault if impressionable children are watching inappropriate shows -- not the show itself .<-->O
That 's why most shows have ratings like 14 + for viewers minimum age .<-->N
These shows are not meant for children , and that is why they 've earned these ratings .<-->N
It is the parents ' job to make sure that these children do not see inappropriate material .<-->O
Older people know the consequences of these actions , and can react appropriately to the situations displayed .<-->N
We agree that if young children who do not know how to react to the situations that are portrayed on some reality TV shows , however , it is not the reality TV that is doing the harm , but rather the irresponsible parents who allow their children to watch these shows .<-->O
Impact : The long-term impact of this is that children will be able to watch the shows that are age appropriate , while adults will be able to be entertained by the sometimes inappropriate material portrayed on reality tv .<-->O
Source : Huffington Post 3 .<-->N
Assertion : People reflect on the bad actions and do what is right .<-->O
Reasoning : Many of the reality tv shows actually show bad things such as drinking , taking drugs , or swearing .<-->O
However , they also show the consequences of doing these bad things .<-->N
Children and even adults watching these shows can see what can happen after doing that , without experiencing it first hand .<-->N
It shows them exactly what not to do .<-->N
Although these shows are not about math or science , they are educational , in the sense that they teach our younger generation right and wrong .<-->O
This would help our children to make the right decisions later in life .<-->O
Evidence : In 2009 , the teenage pregnancy rate in the United States dropped to its lowest levels in 70 years ; the birth rate among girls aged 15 to 19 fell to 39.1 births per 1,000 teens .<-->N
That 's a six per cent decline the largest one-year drop in 40 years .<-->N
The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy released a survey in 2010 , in which 87 percent of teens who had watched MTV 's 16 and Pregnant felt the show educated them about becoming a parent at such a young age .<-->O
Only 13 percent felt the show glamorized teen pregnancy .<-->N
Also , the Girl Scout Institute conducted a survey in April 2001 , which consisted of a national sample of 1,141 girls aged 11 to 17 .<-->N
75 % of surveyed girls said the programs have inspired conversations with their parents and friends .<-->N
Some girls even said they take inspiration from the shows , with 68 % agreeing with the statement that the shows make me think I can achieve anything in life , while 62 % said the shows have raised their awareness of social issues and causes .<-->O
62 % of the reality TV viewers responded No to a question asking , Do you think a girl 's value is based on how she looks ?<-->N
The survey also found that regular reality TV viewers are more confident and self-assured than nonviewers when it comes to virtually every personal characteristic they were asked about .<-->N
In contrast to the popular image that most teen girls are obsessed with being beautiful and getting a boyfriend , this poll comes to many of the opposite conclusions ; for example less than half , 42 % , of the non-viewing girls said they `` spend a lot of time '' on their appearance .<-->O
Impact : Clearly , these reality TV shows are positively benefiting people .<-->N
These teenagers see the consequences of bad decisions , so they do n't make these bad decisions .<-->O
These people are helping to boost self esteem and make them feel like they can achieve anything .<-->O
Source : Discovery Channel , National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , Girl Scout Institute CON -LRB- 3 assertions -RRB- Grabbers : 1 -- Did you know that 62 % of the reality TV viewers responded No to a question asking , Do you think a girl 's value is based on how she looks ?<-->O
2 -- Did you know that over 15 winners of American Idol are now superstars or celebrities ?<-->O
Define : Reality T.V. -- genre of television programming with unscripted situations , documents actual events , and features unprofessional actors More good than harm -- there is some harm , but the benefits outweigh the harms Resolution is specific to the U.S. Weighing Mechanism : This debate will be weighed on which decision would provide the most oppurtunity for success for ordinary people .<-->O
Refutations : AT : Negatively influences people -- Refuted by first point .<-->N
We are arguing that the harm outweighs the good , and it is clearly shown by our first point .<-->O
As we have stated , the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy released a survey in 2010 , in which 87 percent of teens who had watched MTV 's 16 and Pregnant felt the show educated them about becoming a parent at such a young age .<-->O
Only 13 percent felt the show glamorized teen pregnancy .<-->N
87 % is more than 50 % , so the good is outweighing the harm .<-->O
AT : Addictions -- Refuted by second point .<-->N
Hurts the stars on it -- It is completely these people 's choices to participate in these shows .<-->N
It 's not like we forced them to do it , and they should 've realized the risk of humiliation .<-->O
It is completely not the shows ' fault , but the people 's .<-->N
Therefore , reality TV shows should n't be blamed for the people 's choices .<-->N
AT : Inappropriate -- Refuted by second point Causes people to do crazy things just to get on -- It is completely these people 's choices to do this .<-->O
It 's not like we forced them to do these crazy things .<-->O
Reality TV shows should n't be the ones at fault ; it should be the people .<-->O
Assertion : Reality TV leads to increased TV watching in both children and teenagers , which causes grades to drop .<-->F
Reasoning : These children and teenagers get easily addicted to these shows , and this only helps them take away time from their schoolwork .<-->N
The US is already behind most other industrialized countries in education .<-->N
Evidence : According to the New York Times , Americans spend 1/3 of their free time watching television and of that 67 % are reality shows .<-->N
Clearly , this is too much time being wasted watching non-educational , addictive shows .<-->N
Impact : These shows only help make our future generations not as educated and smart .<-->O
This will lead to the unemployment rate going up and more poor , starving , homeless people on the streets .<-->N
Source : New York Times 2 .<-->N
Assertion : Reality TV hurts the stars who are on it , their whole lives , and their reputations .<-->N
Reasoning : When a person becomes part of a reality tv show , they do not realize how their life will be affected .<-->O
These shows will usually make them look mean and nasty .<-->O
These people will end up doing stupid stuff and sometimes stereotyped .<-->O
Evidence : Take , for example , Teresa Giudice , who in the show The Real Housewives of New Jersey , flipped a table at a couple of other women .<-->N
Now , she is thought of as a person with anger problems and many people have sent her mean and nasty notes ; some even asking her if she is going to an anger management class .<-->O
The director of this show loved this , and instead of letting this go , decided to publicize this , making Teresa a very disliked person .<-->N
This is all thanks to reality TV .<-->N
Another example of this is that of Balloon Boy which happened in 2009 .<-->F
A 6-year-old boy was sent in a mylar-balloon on accident into the sky .<-->F
When he landed , the boy was not inside .<-->N
In an interview with the family , the young boy , Falcon Hene , said that his father told him , This is all so we can be famous and on a reality TV show .<-->O
The father soon disregarded this comment but it is obvious that the child told the truth .<-->O
After this incident , this boy was tormented by his friends and classmates , and he was called a liar because his father would not admit his mistake .<-->O
Another example of this is Jon + Kate plus 8 .<-->N
They were once a happy couple but now because of all the stress and work that they must suffer through , they are divorced .<-->O
This also affected their children because now they are split between their father and their mother .<-->N
This decision did not only affect themselves but also affected their children , who sadly did n't have any say what so ever in this matter .<-->O
Impact : People 's lives will be changed because of reality TV .<-->N
This will negatively affect many people who take part in these reality tv shows and ultimately ruin their whole lives forever and ever .<-->O
Clearly , reality TV causes problems and only makes situations worse for these reality TV stars .<-->O
Source : BBC 3 .<-->N
Assertion : Reality television negatively influences people .<-->N
Reasoning : Reality TV shows obviously negatively influence people .<-->N
People wo n't see the consequences of these bad actions ; instead , they will simply copy everything that they do .<-->O
How is this going to help our children , teenagers , and even adults ?<-->N
All these shows show to us is how to do bad things , and we do n't learn from it .<-->O
People imitate everything that happens in these reality TV shows since they are reality .<-->N
However , it 's really just bad behavior that we should n't be teaching to our U.S. citizens .<-->O
It is an assumption that these people will actually analyze the shows and realize that they should n't do these things .<-->O
Judge , after watching TV , do you sit there for half an hour and analyze what you just watched ?<-->N
Or do you just go on with your life ?<-->N
Moreover , do you think that children and teenagers will analyze the shows ?<-->O
The answer is that these people will just copy every negative thing that is shown on the show .<-->O
Evidence : According to Medical Procedure News , reality television is attributing to cosmetic surgery procedures with more than 9.2 million procedures performed as result of people watching these shows .<-->N
Sourced from WebMD Medical News , reality television is contributing to eating disorders in teen girls .<-->N
With shows like Are You Hot ?<-->N
The Search for America 's Sexiest People and Extreme Make Over , young women believe that to be accepted you have to be hot or a bombshell .<-->N
Since the boom of reality television in 2000 , eating disorders in teenage girls -LRB- ages 13-19 -RRB- have nearly tripled .<-->N
Teenage girls are now suffering from anorexia and bulimia , due to the fact that these shows teach them that they need to have no fat and be extremely skinny .<-->O
The Girl Scout Institute conducted a study in April 2011 , which sampled 1,141 girls ages 11 17 .<-->N
All of the girls felt that reality TV shows promote bad behavior .<-->O
The vast majority think these shows often pit girls against each other to make the shows more exciting -LRB- 86 % -RRB- , make people think that fighting is a normal part of a romantic relationship -LRB- 73 % -RRB- , and make people think it 's okay to treat others badly -LRB- 70 % -RRB- .<-->O
Regular reality TV viewers accept and expect a higher level of drama , aggression , and bullying in their own lives as well .<-->O
They are considerably more likely than non-viewers to agree that Gossiping is a normal part of a relationship between girls -LRB- 78 % vs. 54 % -RRB- ; It 's in girls ' nature to be catty and competitive with one another -LRB- 68 % vs. 50 % -RRB- ; and It 's hard for me to trust other girls -LRB- 63 % vs. 50 % -RRB- .<-->O
Impact : Clearly , these shows are detrimental to our U.S. citizens and negatively affecting all of us .<-->N
These teenagers do not realize that these are the things that they should not do ; they follow it as if it 's what they should do .<-->N
This is not sending the right messages to our people .<-->N
Are we trying to tell them that you need to have no fat at all to be pretty ?<-->O
Or are we trying to tell them that everyone needs plastic surgery to become perfect ?<-->O
How about that lying and being mean leads to success .<-->O
Source : Medical Procedure News , WebMD Medical News , Girl Scout Institute ------------- Television does more harm than good -LRB- For further practice in writing an argumentative essay , there is a very useful exercise at the selfaccess.com site . -RRB-<-->O
Your task is to write an argumentative essay in the style of the zoos example elsewhere in this website .<-->N
In other words , you will state your opinion clearly in the first paragraph -LRB- TV does more harm than good -RRB- .<-->O
Then in each of the subsequent paragraphs you will start by acknowledging an argument that is often made by supporters of television but present evidence that their argument is false .<-->O
Finally , you will write a conclusion that restates your main points and boldly spells out what you believe .<-->O
The following is a possible structure for the essay , clustering the arguments into three groups -LRB- educational value , entertainment value and international understanding -RRB- .<-->O
Yes , I have done a lot of the work for you , but these are just notes - you still need to turn them into sentences !<-->O
1 Today 98 % of American households have a TV set and the same is true of most `` developed '' countries .<-->N
Indeed , many homes have more than one set .<-->N
Television is taken for granted , treated as an innocent `` part of the furniture '' but , in fact , it does more harm than good .<-->O
2 Supporters of television argue that = educational -LRB- e.g. science , geography and history documentaries , news programmes , children s programmes such as `` Sesame Street '' -RRB- However , TV viewing is essentially a passive activity that discourages critical thinking indeed , most viewers -LRB- esp .<-->O
children -RRB- watch television indiscriminately Research suggests that TV can slow down young children s speech development A link between literacy problems and frequent TV viewing Similarly , a link between TV and Attention Deficit Disorder -LRB- ADD -RRB- Par .<-->O
3 Those in favour of TV claim that = an innocent form of entertainment especially helpful for housebound elderly people and the physically handicapped On the other hand , television interferes with conversation -LRB- visitors often end up staring at `` the box in the corner '' instead of chatting with their hosts -RRB- .<-->O
Many programmes spread fear and depression by focussing on violence , war , crime and various disasters Some evidence that seeing on-screen violence makes us less sensitive to the real thing Par .<-->O
4 Proponents of TV sometimes suggest that closes the gap between different nations and cultures -LRB- e.g. satellite TV news reaches people simultaneously all around the world -RRB- As a result , >> > greater cross-cultural understanding and respect However , The satellite channels are controlled by powerful `` western '' corporations and the culture of the programmes is predominantly North American , European or Australian -LRB- Not an equal sharing of information , opinions or cultural expressions -RRB- Television is often used as a propaganda tool -LRB- e.g. coverage of the Gulf War or Afghanistan -RRB- In a very subtle way , television encourages materialism people in `` developing '' countries develop a desire for Coca-Cola , Big Macs , fast cars and western fashions Par .<-->O
5 In conclusion , TV viewing accelerates the process of `` Coca-colonisation '' ; destroys the art of conversation and a healthy , optimistic view of life ; and turns people into unthinking , illiterate `` couch potatoes '' .<-->O
Just as a drug addict must kick their habit in order to avoid an early death , so the world must switch off its TVs if it wishes to produce active , intelligent citizens !<-->O
----------------- Do reality shows that makeover schools do more harm than good ?<-->N
ESPN confirmed this week that it has no plans for another season of Rise Up , a reality series that was supposed to give needy high schools athletic facilities an upgrade .<-->O
It sounds like that 's fine with Ingraham High .<-->N
Traci Huffer , Athletic Director at Ingraham High School , which participated in Rise Up , said the school will need to wait a few years before agreeing to do a makeover-type program again .<-->O
I am still cleaning up some of the things that didn t go the way they were supposed to go , Huffer said , adding that she would rather remain gracious to the things they gave us instead of elaborating on what went wrong .<-->O
Overall it was a positive experience , but there are a few things we have to clean up , she said .<-->N
It was also a little time consuming and with the district being short on funds , it s now in our hands .<-->N
-LRB- An ESPN rep said said that the school 's renovation was not the sole responsibility of `` Rise Up , '' and that many goods and services were donated by local businesses and people in the community . -RRB-<-->N
`` Rise Up '' is the latest school makeover show to get the axe .<-->N
ABC s Food Revolution , which focused on overhauling unhealthy school lunch menus , was canceled midseason with slipping ratings .<-->N
NBC s School Pride , which renovated aging school buildings , was not renewed for a second season .<-->F
And ratings aside , several of the schools involved in the shows ended up on the short end of things .<-->N
The Los Angeles Unified School District -LRB- LAUSD -RRB- refused to allow Jamie Oliver s Food Revolution cameras inside their campuses last year on the heels of a bad experience filming NBC s School Pride .<-->N
School Pride wanted us to re-do some things on our campus and we ended up with a $ 106,000 tab for work they were suppose to do , LAUSP rep Robert Alaniz claimed .<-->N
They did one coat of paint on one building and the paint was peeling in two weeks .<-->N
They reneged on reimbursing us and we had to use tax payer money to fix that .<-->N
Alaniz said the decision to turn way Oliver was cemented after someone from the Cabell County School District which was featured on Season One of Oliver s show told them the show ran their finances into the red and didn t pay its end of the deal .<-->O
A rep for the Cabell County School District declined to comment .<-->N
Tracy Handline , a teacher at Needles High School in California which also took part in School Pride , said that while the show did benefit the community , it wasn t all it was fluffed up to be on the small screen .<-->N
They did make some improvements , but they didn t do major change .<-->N
It was pretty cosmetic , there was no systematic change in the way things happened , she explained .<-->N
What the show tried to do was expose some kind of dirty dealing .<-->O
They come in and do all this interviewing like they are exposing some big thing , then they leave .<-->N
We are this little tiny town that has to deal with all the people that may have gotten their feelings hurt .<-->O
-LRB- Producers came to us -RRB- asking for referrals and our involvement , but the show made it look is that the students wrote in and sent a video but that is not actually what happened . ''<-->O
It 's no surprise that -LRB- being featured -RRB- can end up costing already cash-strapped schools lots of taxpayer money .<-->N
This is money better spent on good teachers , renovation and new technology , communications and PR expert Jason Maloni , of Levick Strategic Communications , told FOX411 s Pop Tarts column .<-->O
It 's unfair to cast students in the roles of savior .<-->N
However , L.A.-based television producer , Dianne Namm , argued that school makeover shows do shed light on important issues .<-->N
America 's school system is in need of attention .<-->N
Hollywood 's desire to make us aware of that is a genuine one , she explained .<-->O
Perhaps the -LRB- reality show -RRB- format is n't yet right , but the basic story premise , that our schools need our help , as do our children who attend them , is what matters .<-->O
Justin Hochberg of The Hochberg Ebersol Company , an unscripted television-focused production company , agreed that in focusing on school-related concerns , rather than ignoring them , helps the end goals of raising money , increasing community involvement and creating necessary change .<-->O
As an example , our USA Network special NFL Characters Unite featured a student at Clairton High School in Pennsylvania .<-->N
Our efforts not only changed one teen s life , but transformed his school s community , he claimed .<-->N
They felt listened to and had a greater sense of togetherness as a result of participating in our program , and that is a fantastic example of the positive power of television .<-->O
But based on the mixed grades many school makeover shows seem to have earned from schools and audiences , some industry experts predict that this reality sub-genre that will stay in Hollywood detention for a little while longer .<-->O
The only school on TV that s ever gotten high attendance was Flavor Flav s Charm School , former reality television producer Mikey Glazer added .<-->N
Right now , ratings suggest that America would rather watch bikini bachelor cattiness , or women throwing champagne glasses at each other s head or social climbers marrying NBA players .<-->O
ABC did not respond to a request for comment and NBC declined to comment -------------- Do Reality Shows do more Harm than Good ?<-->N
It is said that the people of today are the creators of a better tomorrow .<-->N
This statement has spread through the world and has helped to make people realize that new talent , and innovative skills are to be appreciated .<-->N
Along with this realization have risen the tools for the display of new and vivid talents .<-->N
Involving the internet , television , radios and other means of widely viewed mass media ; the market for new talent has opened up .<-->N
Today , there are millions of blogs and websites which portray stories , advice and new activities which can be nurtured to be hobbies ; people speak on the radio and put forth their creative ideas in form of slogans and jingles ; and people display their avid and colorful acts in form of dance , music and drama on television .<-->O
But which of the three is the most successful ?<-->N
In my opinion , that is the last one ; the one which involves the telly .<-->N
This is possible as in the current world , almost every family possesses a television .<-->N
The radio has almost faded away into the past and the internet is the near future .<-->N
Thus shows proclaiming new talent -LRB- or reality shows -RRB- work as positive , that to on a wider base .<-->N
Open to all of the populace , these shows invite people to display their talents on a wider stage .<-->N
This works especially well for people hailing from poorer parts as it puts the light on them .<-->O
Also working to induce new ideas in the minds of the public -LRB- in the form of cookery shows , and dance programs -RRB- ; these shows help people in obtaining new and creative hobbies or activities which allow time to pass at a fast pace along with an exciting outcome .<-->O
These shows help to lighten the mood and to make laugh as well -LRB- comedy shows and shows involving gags -RRB- .<-->O
These work to be perfect entertainers and they provide a break from the dramatic soap operas which currently permeate the television network .<-->O
Lastly , there are the quiz shows which enlighten the audience about current affairs , global history and general knowledge .<-->N
These shows also provide a chance for people with alarming knowledge and intelligence levels to surface on a global scale .<-->O
But the question which arises in my mind from all of the shows which invite people is that : What guarantee is there that the talents aren t modified and edited ?<-->N
well , this will always be an issue which litters people s minds as they see the arms of corruption unfold in front of them .<-->O
The only thing which can be said to this is the fact that these shows bring out talent .<-->O
They bring out talent and also open up more avenues .<-->N
The only other point is raised on the shows which show immense bravery and courage in the form of dare-devilry and involve danger to the person/persons involved .<-->O
These stunts , if performed at home , can prove fatal .<-->N
This can be viewed many-a-times on the news .<-->N
In answer to this , shows have begun the display of statutory warnings which warn people of the hazardous consequences of the events .<-->F
And this has worked .<-->N
Summarizing all of the above points , I reach a conclusion which makes me support the side of the reality shows .<-->O
These shows have a lot of benefits socially and they also involve a display of what is to proceed in the future in form of innovative talents .<-->N
So , in my opinion , the statement which says that television which do more harm than good is completely false and is based on shaky grounds .<-->O
------------------- TV does more harm than good to kids Parents are being warned to limit the amount of television their children watch before the age of two , after a major review found that it can do more harm than good to their ongoing development .<-->O
Prof Dimitri Christakis of the Seattle Children s Research Institute carried out an extensive review involving 78 studies published over the last 25 years .<-->N
The review looked at the effect that television has on children s language , cognitive skills and attention capacity .<-->N
No studies to date have demonstrated benefits associated with early infant TV viewing .<-->N
The weight of existing evidence suggests the potential for harm and I believe that parents should exercise due caution in exposing infants to excessive media , Prof Christakis said .<-->O
He pointed out that many children under the age of two watch television regularly , despite ongoing warnings .<-->N
Some spend as much as 40 % of their waking hours in front of a TV .<-->N
Prof Christakis found that according to a number of studies , watching TV programmes or DVDs aimed at infants can actually delay language development .<-->N
For example , a 2008 Thai study found that if children under 12 months watched TV for more than two hours a day , they were six times more likely to have delayed language skills .<-->N
Another study found that children who watched baby DVDs between seven and 16 months knew fewer words than children who did not .<-->O
The review also found that infants as young as 14 months will imitate what they see on a TV screen , but they learn better from live presentations .<-->O
For example , one study found that children learnt Mandarin Chinese better from a native speaker than they did from a video of the same speaker .<-->N
In one study carried out by Prof Christakis and his colleagues , they found that children who had watched a lot of TV in their early years did not perform as well when they underwent tests to check their reading and memory skills .<-->N
In another study carried out by the professor and his colleagues , they found a link between TV viewing before the age of three and attention problems at the age of seven .<-->N
Meanwhile more than one in five parents who took part in another study said that they got their infants to watch TV when they needed time to themselves .<-->N
This , Prof Christakis said , is an understandable and realistic need , but not one that should be actively promoted .<-->O
When querying why television has such a negative effect on children of this age , the professor said that one reason is the fact that it exposes children to flashing lights , scene changes , quick edits and auditory cuts which may be over stimulating to developing brains .<-->O
TV also replaces other more important and appropriate activities like playing or interacting with parents , he explained .<-->O
Prof Christakis pointed out that while there have been concerns about infants viewing TV for the last four decades , it is only in recent years that studies have provided the data to back up those concerns .<-->O
The explosion in infant TV viewing and the potential risks associated with it raise several important policy implications .<-->N
First and foremost , the lack of regulation related to claims made by people promoting programmes and DVDs aimed at infants is problematic .<-->O
Educational claims should , and can , be based on scientific data .<-->N
Despite this , the names of the products and the testimonials they use often convince parents that TV viewing has a positive impact on their infants , he said .<-->N
Secondly , parents need to be better informed about what activities really do promote healthy development in young children .<-->O
This may provide some defence against the aggressive marketing techniques being employed .<-->N
Last , but not least , more resources need to be made available to fund critical research related to the effects of media on young children .<-->O
------------ Reality tv does more harm than good !<-->N
Do you agree ?<-->N
Pro : Human interest - good for social studies etc. how people will react in certain situations .<-->O
Con : Most of these people are put into situations and told to create drama or should i say paid to do so , therefore not presenting an actual representation of how people will react in these situations making the whole thing quite nonsensical .<-->O
Pro : It allows acknowledgement within a society for peoples talents that may not otherwise be recognised otherwise since most people are successful because of money/connections = power .<-->O
Con : Most of the people who audition for these shows are not talented and only want fame .<-->O
it encourages people to undertake degrading behaviour in order to get attention and detracts from the purpose of these shows .<-->N
Sorry i wrote a more wordy answer but lost my net connection and therefore the answer grr , this is the best i could remember .<-->O
A little tired -LRB- studying for my exams atm so my head isnt on straight -RRB- but im sure you can make this sound more intellectual and i hope i was of some help .<-->O
Good luck with your debate .<-->O
Well , some counter-arguments you may encounter : 1 .<-->N
They can give ordinary people a chance to break into the entertainment industry -LRB- e.g. .<-->N
So you think you can dance , Idol series -RRB- 2 .<-->N
They can show and demonstrate raw human nature -LRB- eg .<-->N
The Amazing Race , Big Brother -RRB- 3 .<-->N
Some shows may motivate people to be improve themselves to become a better person -LRB- eg .<-->O
The Biggest Loser -RRB- 4 .<-->N
They can promote good teamwork and co-operation and the success because of it .<-->O
-LRB- eg .<-->N

Those are some I could think of , which was quite hard since I hate reality television in general .<-->O
There are plenty of voters who believe that prisoners convicted of crimes and receiving a custodial sentence should not have the right to vote .<-->O
They should be punished , voting rights removed , do their time , put up and shut up .<-->N
However , many people think prison should be about rehabilitation ; a place to create opportunities for healing and personal transformation otherwise absent in the often highly dysfunctional and damaged lives of many prisoners .<-->O
I have been part of the UK prison system since the age of 12 , as a visitor to my long-serving father , as an inmate and , since serving my last conviction in 1989 , as a workshop facilitator and writer in residence in prisons throughout England and Wales .<-->N
A prisoner 's rehabilitation as a safe , responsible and productive member of society must include the most basic right of democratic process the right to choose who governs us .<-->O
To remove this right dehumanises prisoners .<-->N
Our streets are rife with blue and white collar criminals , convicted , on bail or simply waiting for the fateful tap on the shoulder .<-->O
Currently , if individuals are convicted of a crime but not given a custodial sentence they are still allowed to vote ; why should they be treated differently from convicted criminals who are locked up ?<-->O
We must not confuse a criminal conviction and subsequent removal from society -LRB- an often essential part of the process of rehabilitation -RRB- with a need to remove the essential human right to vote .<-->O
This was the basis of the recent EU decision to insist that the UK gives the vote to its prisoners .<-->N
Europe has a wide and varied response to the issue .<-->N
Denmark , Sweden and Switzerland have no ban on prisoner voting rights .<-->N
In 13 other European countries , electoral disqualification depends on the crime committed or the length of the sentence .<-->N
The 1983 Mental Health Act uses a system of individual assessment to determine a patient 's eligibility to vote .<-->N
Perhaps , using a similar system , the decision to allow prisoner voting rights could be based on the nature and severity of their crime ?<-->O
A process could be set up that would follow a parallel path to parole procedure as part of tracking a prisoner 's rehabilitation and readiness to re-enter society .<-->O
The prisoners I work with are human beings who each have a reason for committing their crimes .<-->N
Taken out of the daily grind of crime they quickly see the need for a process of rehabilitation and help in stabilising their lives ; lives more often than not destroyed by economic deprivation , family breakdown and addiction .<-->O
Perhaps if voting rights were given to UK prisoners , politicians would take the rights , needs and interests of some 90,000 inmates more seriously .<-->O
They would need to canvas inside prisons for votes and listen to the voices of the wide range of citizens we have behind bars .<-->O
Part of this canvassing could involve a genuine focus on the long-term rehabilitation of the individual .<-->O
This in turn could lead to reduced reoffending rates and maybe , just maybe , a society with fewer criminals and fewer prisoners .<-->O
Caspar Walsh is an author , journalist and founder of the award-winning charity Write to Freedom ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is really no polite way to say this so here s the thing ; they are put behind bars because they have committed a crime and therefore are dangerous to society .<-->O
From rapists to murderers to thieves and the like , these prisons keep them all and in the process , make the country safer to live in .<-->N
When you break the law , you have no business enjoying the rights that would otherwise have been at your disposal had the crime not been committed .<-->O
Anyone that breaks the law doesn t have the country s best interests at heart .<-->O
So how can such people be allowed to vote ?<-->N
Yes , people do change , and usually when someone shows an improvement in their behaviour , their sentence is sometimes reduced , of course depending on the crime they committed .<-->N
If the state believes someone has reformed to the level that they can be trusted to live with others again , they are let out of prison .<-->N
And then the person can have their rights again .<-->N
I am not advocating for an inhumane criminal justice system but they are locked up because of poor decisions that led to chaotic actions .<-->O
They got themselves into that mess so they should get themselves and behave well to serve a lighter sentence .<-->O
I completely agree that prisoners need to be educated because when they finally get out , they can be beneficial to society instead of being idle and disorderly .<-->O
Letting prisoners vote is devaluing the country .<-->N
It is funny to say that denying a prisoner a chance to vote is a violation of human rights .<-->O
Although some prisoners are not necessarily evil , when behind bars , they are not part of the citizens that can demand full rights .<-->O
We simply shouldn t tamper with our judicial system .<-->N
As I ve already argued , prisons need to reform and rehabilitate their inmates to truly cut crime .<-->O
People need to understand that there are consequences to committing a crime .<-->O
It does not go away unpunished .<-->N
Don t do the crime if you can t do the time .<-->N
And when you are doing time , do not expect your rights to be considered because when the crime was being committed , the one responsible didn t consider anything .<-->O
This is not something we should look deep into ; this is not something that will keep you up at night .<-->O
Prisons are for separation and rehabilitation , not pampering them with rights .<-->N
Finally , the government of Rwanda is already doing too much for prisoners above and beyond their rights .<-->O
I think they should first absorb that great treatment before we even think of giving them more .<-->O
**** Yes , they can still play their civic duty The issue of whether prisoners should be allowed certain civil liberties is highly contentious because of the intricacies of the law punishing the offense committed ; although prisoners have been lucky to access certain liberties like right to education , exercise and entertainment materials such as radio , CD players , cassette recorders and television , some of these rights are subject to the situation in the prison .<-->O

Prisoners are not allowed to vote in any election given the fact that they lose their freedom once they are convicted .<-->O
But , I believe they should be given a right to vote since voting is a right , not a privilege , and actually I think it s a responsibility .<-->O
I would agree that prisoners wouldn t put it at the top of the list of things they want but maybe that s because it is not given to them .<-->O
It s the same way you would find that voting is not on top of the list of the first 50 people on the street you come across .<-->N
It s still an important civic responsibility .<-->O
In other ways , voting can be more important if you lose your freedom , because we want to reintegrate people , we want them to see themselves as citizens , even if they re in prison .<-->O
People might argue that allowing them to vote can be expensive and unrealistic but it is unjustifiable since they are not in prison because the system wants to cut costs .<-->O
Similarly , the fact that prisoners lose many freedoms does not imply they should lose all their civil rights .<-->O
Denying them the right to vote is likely to undermine the respect for the rule of law .<-->O
Allowing prisoners the right to vote , however , may strengthen their social ties and dedication to the common good ; thereby encouraging legally responsible involvement in the civil society .<-->O
If we really want convicted felons to re-engage with society , become transformed , and feel like part of a broader community , we should do everything possible to re-integrate these individuals into ordinary society .<-->O
In terms of being a just society , it is not fair if some people have to give up their voting rights just because we think they can t be useful .<-->O
If we can use them in other nation building activities , why not allow them to vote ?<-->N
Instead of denying them the right to vote , we should discuss about what prison is for , what we do with long-term prisoners , and issues about self-injury , inactivity , violence and expense .<-->O
Prisoners are more likely to be aware of the dangers of such issues and how much they cost society if they are allowed to vote .<-->O
And it shouldn t be about voting for top offices , they should be allowed to vote in grass root elections as well .<-->O
If we encourage the relationship between prisoners and local government , prisoners are likely to pay more attention to issues of resettlement and employment .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Right now , just two states in our nation are full democracies : Maine and Vermont .<-->O
That 's because those two New England states are the only states in the entire country that let convicted felons vote while they 're in prison and when they leave prison .<-->O
The other 48 states should be following their example .<-->N
The right to vote is the foundational building block of our democratic republic .<-->O
If we want everybody involved in our democracy , then everybody should be able to vote .<-->O
Somewhere along the way , a bunch of states decided it was a good idea to cut people off from the right to vote if they broke the law .<-->O
It turns out , that 's stupid and counterproductive .<-->O
When people vote , they feel like they 're part of something bigger than themselves .<-->O
They feel like they 're part of the nation .<-->O
They know that they have a say in the way things are run in this country .<-->N
At some point , most felons will leave prison and re-enter everyday society .<-->O
As we prepare them for everyday life outside of a prison cell or a jail-yard , we have to make them feel like they 're an essential part of the community before letting them free .<-->O
When prisoners can vote while behind bars , that 's one more reason for them to feel like they 're still part of the outside world and one less reason for them to feel alienated and break the law again .<-->O
This is n't just good for prisoners and ex-prisoners , though .<-->O
It 's good for everyone and it 's good for the health of democracy .<-->N
When more people participate in the democratic process and when more people get to make decisions about who they want in office , politicians and the media respond to their interests .<-->O
And when the media and political class respond to the needs and interests of all citizens , that , in turn , encourages people to continue to get out and vote .<-->N
This virtuous cycle is essential to democracy .<-->N
In fact , it 's the whole point of a democratic republic in the first place .<-->O
We want people to vote because in a democratic republic every viewpoint contributes something important to the marketplace of ideas .<-->O
So when convicted felons and prisoners get to vote , they add yet another voice to our democracy .<-->N
And that 's good for everyone .<-->N
The suggestion that everybody , even felons , should be allowed and encouraged to vote is absolutely consistent with the American tradition of making our democracy more and more inclusive , generation after generation .<-->O
Early in our country 's history , the right to vote was restricted in some states to propertied , literate white men .<-->O
At the same time , though , the arc of our history has been to give more and more people the vote , to add more people to the political community .<-->N
We gave voting rights to freed slaves with the 15th Amendment , we gave voting rights to adult women with the 19th Amendment , and we gave voting rights to 18 year-olds with the 26th Amendment .<-->O
We gave the right to vote to all these groups because the more people that participate in the democratic process , the better it is for our nation .<-->O
We gave them the right to vote because we believe that all groups contribute something essential to society and that everyone benefits from their participation .<-->O
Tragically , since the Reagan Revolution , we 've seen state after state move to restrict the right to vote .<-->O
Florida is trying to stop old people from voting .<-->N
North Carolina wants to stop students from voting .<-->N
Texas is going after the voting rights of blacks and Hispanics .<-->N
State after state , across our country , voter suppression laws have been promoted with money from billionaires like the Koch brothers to make voting more and more difficult and thus turn the `` voting class '' into one that is largely wealthy and white .<-->O
It 's time to reverse this insane trend .<-->N
All citizens deserve the right to vote .<-->O
It 's simple as that .<-->N
The only time you lose your right to vote should be when you renounce your citizenship and abandon the political community .<-->O
Until then , everyone , regardless of their skin color , their economic status , whether they are a student or a senior citizen should be encouraged to vote .<-->N
Voting rights for prisoners and ex-felons is just the logical next step .<-->O
And the best way to do ensure this is by passing a constitutional amendment establishing an affirmative right to vote for every American citizen .<-->O
It 's as simple as that .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Voting is a basic right .<-->O
In a democracy , votes can not be a luxury granted to us by politicians for good behaviour .<-->N
Universal suffrage is fundamental to the legitimacy of state power .<-->O
Why do we put people in prison ?<-->N
For public safety , of course to keep dangerous people from causing more harm .<-->N
We hope to deter crimes and punish those who have committed one .<-->O
Most of us also think prison should serve as a place for rehabilitation , so that people leave less likely to break the law again .<-->O
Which of these aims is served by taking away prisoners right to vote ?<-->N
Not public safety , that s for sure ; exercising this democratic right won t endanger others .<-->O
And if you think losing the vote will be what stops someone from stealing a TV , you clearly haven t understood the real causes of crime .<-->O
Perhaps it s justified as punishment , then ?<-->N
This trap is made all the more tempting by that vicious , visceral anger we feel when faced with terrible crimes .<-->O
But this is not the ground from which to make public policy that way lies a medieval form of justice that inevitably denigrates all of our humanity .<-->O
That s why , when people go to prison , it is crucial they remain full citizens , still subject to our laws .<-->O
We don t allow them to be tortured or starved ; why deprive them of the vote a form of civic death ?<-->O
It s unnecessary and serves no end .<-->N
Worse , it does serious harm .<-->O
It further ostracises prisoners from society , actively undermining their rehabilitation into a responsible citizen .<-->O
If prisoners want to participate in democracy , why not welcome their willingness to engage with the hope of a better society ?<-->O
That s one of the things that voting is , after all .<-->N
The rest of the world is leaving us behind on this while some in Westminster stamp their feet and put their fingers in their ears .<-->N
Human rights and democracy are two sides of the same coin ; both necessary to the other and when things go well mutually reinforcing .<-->O
Voting is a fundamental right , not a privilege , and it is time we remembered that .<-->O
DuelSeptno Voting is a basic right but it s not absolute , unlike the ban on torture .<-->O
In Britain , we have always maintained that freedom comes with responsibilities .<-->N
If you are convicted of a crime justifying prison , you forfeit your liberty and certain civic rights .<-->O
To say prisoners must remain full citizens with all the attendant rights , when we have locked them up , depriving them of so many freedoms , doesn t make much sense .<-->O
It s only temporary , so hardly civic death .<-->O
And we qualify offenders rights outside prison too through criminal record checks and restrictions on certain types of employment .<-->O
You say the rest of the world is leaving us behind .<-->N
Yet neither the European Convention on Human Rights nor wider international law requires prisoners to be given the vote .<-->N
A minority of European Union countries give all prisoners the vote and plenty of democratic countries retain full bans including Estonia , Liechtenstein , most states in the United States and Australia , Brazil and Japan .<-->O
In the United Kingdom , parliament decided a prisoner earns back his lost rights by serving his sentence scarcely a slippery slope to medieval punishments .<-->O
I doubt it s the most important incentive , but you can t have it both ways : you say the ban is pointless because it won t stop anyone committing crime , but then argue that encouraging prisoners to participate in democracy helps rehabilitation .<-->O
And debating the purposes of criminal justice only highlights that this is about social policy not fundamental rights .<-->O
That brings us to the crux .<-->N
Why are we even having this debate ?<-->N
If you want more prisoner rehabilitation then illiteracy and drug abuse are greater issues .<-->O
If prisoners must have full rights , why not campaign to lift the ban on them holding elected office ?<-->O
The only reason we re debating this fringe issue is because the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg decided on a whim to create a novel right , which neither features in the convention nor was intended to do so by its architects , on an issue of social policy that should be left to elected law-makers .<-->O
That is a flagrant violation of its judicial role .<-->N
Judges are there to interpret and apply the law , not to re-write it or decide social policy without democratic oversight .<-->O
Our ever-expanding human rights laws are creating a serious democratic deficit .<-->O
DuelSeptyes There is a revealing contradiction at the heart of your response .<-->O
One moment you call voting a basic right but not an absolute one .<-->O
Later you say this is about social policy not fundamental rights .<-->N
Which is it ?<-->N
It would seem odd if a democratically-elected politician , however extreme or sceptical on human rights , considered the franchise to be anything other than a vital civil rights question .<-->O
It is hardly a socio - economic matter to do with tax and spending .<-->N
If the basic rules governing participatory democracy aren t a matter for law and judicial referees , it is hard to see what is .<-->O
The fact that a right is qualified or balanced or not absolute , makes it no less fundamental .<-->O
Most of our rights and freedoms -LRB- privacy and free speech included -RRB- can be interfered with if proportionate to a legitimate societal objective .<-->O
My question is : what good is served by the current blanket , Victorian ban on any prisoner voting ?<-->N
The central difference between us appears to be that I believe it is for the state to justify any interference with an individual s rights .<-->O
You seem to suggest that they are earned , lost and re-earned by the people in this case prisoners .<-->O
There are sometimes logical justifications for locking people up after a criminal conviction .<-->O
Imprisonment for serious crime may protect the public ; deter some potential and further offending ; and provide a safe space for the education and rehabilitation of offenders with a view to their re-entering society more productively , better able to engage with their neighbours .<-->O
But what objective is served by a blunt ban on any convicted prisoner voting ?<-->O
It dates to an age and idea of civic death : you have offended and are now dead to the rest of us .<-->O
This unenlightened thinking is as costly in fiscal terms as it is in human terms .<-->N
Citing the US with its vast private prison estate and use of the death penalty is hardly persuasive .<-->O
And Estonia and Lichtenstein really ?<-->N
DuelSeptno Of course we have basic rights that are important but not classified as fundamental human rights , such as the right to a refund when you buy jeans .<-->O
And international law recognises different tiers of human rights : personal privacy can be restricted , the ban on torture can t. Nowhere in international law not in the European Convention , not in the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are prisoners granted a right to vote .<-->O
So you are either trying to expand human rights law , or just pressing a policy issue .<-->O
Either way , if you are a democrat , it must be for elected law-makers , accountable to voters , to decide .<-->O
I respect your policy arguments for lifting the ban , but disagree for principled reasons -LRB- that with rights come responsibilities -RRB- and practical ones -LRB- that earned release is more likely to promote rehabilitation -RRB- .<-->O
Crucially , those campaigning against the ban failed to convince parliament , which in 2011 voted in favour of retaining it by 234 votes to 22 .<-->O
You say this is a vital civil rights issue , because it affects the franchise .<-->O
So why aren t we debating any other criteria age , capacity , nationality , exclusion of peers or restrictions on standing for office ?<-->N
The truth , which you have yet to even acknowledge , is that we re only debating this third order issue because the court in Strasbourg has torn up the basic rules of democracy and ordered Britain to re-write its laws .<-->O
As David Neuberger , President of the UK Supreme Court , said about attempts to shift the parameters of human rights law , placing such decisions in the hands of the judicial branch poses a danger for the judiciary and for liberal democracy .<-->O
Many senior judges agree .<-->N
I m struck by how dismissive you are of anyone with a different view on this issue , labelling us extreme and unenlightened .<-->O
You re insulting a large proportion of the public .<-->N
The risk for human rights campaigners is that these intolerant and undemocratic tactics reveal an increasingly authoritarian wolf in progressive sheep s clothing , at odds with Britain s proud tradition of liberty and democracy .<-->O
DuelSeptyes Sticks and stones , Mr Raab I m struck that you should spend so much time talking about wolves and sheep .<-->O
To return to the debate , I m afraid that the trivialising re-write of international law to replace your denim is completely lost on me .<-->O
So is your curious if novel distinction between basic and fundamental rights .<-->O
The European Convention contains a right to participate in elections .<-->N
If it didn t , there would have been no judgements against the UK government and , you re right , we wouldn t be having this debate now .<-->O
I make no apology for entering into policy debate on prisoners voting rights .<-->N
As I tried to explain earlier , qualified rights may be limited for proportionate policy objectives .<-->O
But I have yet to hear a single one from you .<-->N
Rights come with responsibilities isn t a policy but a slogan that could justify depriving prisoners of all communication with the outside world .<-->N
I need no lectures on democracy .<-->N
It can not survive without the rule of law .<-->N
Many good Conservative friends of mine -LRB- not least Dominic Grieve , the finest Attorney General of recent years -RRB- , appreciate that when you join a family of nations like the Council of Europe with a convention and a court , you have to respect even the judgements you disagree with .<-->O
The European Court has not ruled that all prisoners must have the right to vote , only that a blanket ban is unacceptable .<-->O
Respecting the judgement could be achieved by as small a gesture as giving short-term prisoners the vote .<-->N
Your judge-bashing , by contrast , is petulant populism unworthy of the party of Winston Churchill , who promoted both the better treatment of prisoners and the European Convention itself .<-->O
DuelSeptno Temporarily forfeiting the vote is a legitimate sanction for imprisonable offences .<-->N
We need to stop criminals brandishing human rights to turn the justice system on its head .<-->O
You don t just need a lecture , Shami , but taking back to school on the basics of democracy .<-->O
First , the convention was carefully worded to include a duty on governments to hold elections , but no individual right for prisoners to vote .<-->O
If it had been in the convention it would not have taken the Strasbourg court until 2005 to find it .<-->N
Second , that rights come with responsibilities is not a slogan but constitutional theory , argued by the influential American jurist Wesley Hohfeld , which every undergraduate learns .<-->N
Third , you re no ally to the Rule of Law , which requires predictable rules .<-->N
Human rights make it impossible to know with any certainty what the law is .<-->O
Fourth , you say we should give prisoners the vote as a small gesture to the court .<-->N
What is this , a judicial body adjudicating law or a political haggle ?<-->N
Far from judge-bashing , I regularly cite senior British judges lamenting the democratic deficit created by our human rights laws .<-->N
I won t relish snubbing Strasbourg .<-->N
Ultimately , however , I believe defending democracy at home is more important than observing diplomatic niceties abroad .<-->O

If prison has any purpose beyond the temporary protection of society , it has to be about educating and rehabilitating the prisoners .<-->N
Education begins with two essentials - literacy and the opening of the mind .<-->N
What better way to open a mind than to explain the meaning and the value of the vote ?<-->O
We must teach the history of its being won and explain our universal franchise and inculcate in every prisoner - the no-hopers , the down and outs , the excluded and the outcasts - the understanding that , in law , their vote is worth precisely the same as the Prime Minister 's and the Prison Governor 's .<-->O
This could produce the beginning of a sense of self-worth without which no-one will ever be fully rehabilitated .<-->O
Withdrawing the right to vote is no punishment to those who have never understood its value .<-->O

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the UK all convicted prisoners are denied the right to vote .<-->N
But the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Britain 's blanket ban on voting for all convicted prisoners is a breach their human rights .<-->N
Allowing only some categories of prisoners to vote would be ok , states the Court ; but refusing the vote to all convicted prisoners is unacceptable .<-->N
What do you think ?<-->N
-LRB- What I think is posted at the end of this article -RRB- Firstly , it s probably helpful to understand the history of prisoner voting in the UK .<-->O
It s quite complicated , because it was n't always the case that all prisoners in Britain were denied the vote .<-->N
The long road to democratic representation for all people men and women , titled or not , rich or poor , of all ages - has been slow , tortuous and required many heated debates over hundreds of years .<-->O
Between 1430 and 1832 only around one-in-five men could vote .<-->N
The Great Reform Act of 1832 gave more people the vote but only if you were a man who owned property , and so the majority of working men still could not vote -LRB- and no women could vote -RRB- .<-->O
The first law against prisoner voting in England , Wales and Ireland was the Forfeiture Act of 1870 , which barred any felon sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment from voting .<-->O
However , although the law allowed short-term prisoners to vote , they could n't for practical reasons : they were not allowed to leave prison to go to the polling booth .<-->O
In addition , prisoners were not permitted to use their home address on the electoral register whilst in jail .<-->N
In due course , the law would also prevent prisoners from registering their prison address as their residence on the electoral register .<-->N
In those days , voting was not yet considered a universal right , with the democratic principle of one person , one vote , of equal worth .<-->O
Until 1918 , voting rights were only granted to men who owned property .<-->N
This was changed in 1918 , when women of property were also given the right to vote , but only those aged 30 and over , whereas from 1918 all men aged 21 and over could vote -LRB- with or without property -RRB- .<-->O
Women did n't achieve equal voting rights with men until 1928 .<-->N
Up until 1948 , business owners and university graduates were also allowed additional votes .<-->N
The Representation of the People Act of 1948 introduced postal voting on a limited basis , for those `` no longer resident at their qualifying address '' .<-->N
Consequently , those imprisoned for 12 months or less as stipulated in the 1870 Act could now use a postal vote , so long as they remained registered at their home addresses .<-->O
At about the same time , Scotland took a somewhat different route : their Criminal Justice -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1949 , combined with the introduction of postal voting , resulted in the removal of any limitations on prisoners in Scotland from voting .<-->N
In the General Election of 1950 some short-term prisoners in England and Wales did make use of the new postal vote .<-->F
The Times then reported , `` among the postal votes to be returned in Manchester were a number from prisons in Cardiff , Lincoln , Preston and Manchester . ''<-->N
In 1951 , the UK ratified the European Convention on Human Rights , including Protocol One : an undertaking to , hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot , under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature .<-->O
The Criminal Law Acts of 1967 removed any distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours .<-->N
The result was that only prisoners convicted of treason would be barred from voting .<-->N
This brought the law in England , Wales and Northern Ireland into line with Scotland , by removing the limitations on prisoner voting .<-->N
During the House of Lords debate on the 1967 Act , Lord Stonham , Labour s Minister of State at the Home Office said , `` By Section 2 of the Forfeiture Act 1870 , conviction of a felony resulting in imprisonment for over twelve months disqualifies the offender from holding office under the Crown , or various other offices ; from membership of either House of Parliament ; from voting at elections and the Government agree with the Criminal Law Revision committee that these automatic disqualifications should not be continued . ''<-->O
In effect , the new law meant there were no statutory restrictions on prisoner voting in all of the United Kingdom from 1967 .<-->N
However , there were still practical restrictions on criminals voting who were in prison for more than a year .<-->O
That s because , although the 1948 Act permitted postal voting , this was only allowed for those , no longer resident at their qualifying address -LRB- i.e. their home address shown on the Electoral Register -RRB- .<-->N
So a prisoner might only be able to cast a postal vote during their first year in prison , because every year a new Electoral Register would be printed which could no longer list the prisoner s previous home as their qualifying address .<-->O
Since it was not permitted to register a prison as a qualifying address on the Electoral Register , postal voting would no longer be possible once the new Electoral Register was published .<-->O
But the lifting of statutory restrictions on prisoner voting was short lived .<-->N
Just two years later , Parliament had a change of mind with the Representation of the People Act 1969 , which banned all convicted prisoners from being allowed to vote in the UK , including Scotland .<-->N
Eventually the 1969 Act was replaced by the Representation of the People Act 1983 , which reiterated the ban on prisoner voting , and remains in force to this day .<-->O
The 1983 Act states : `` A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election . ''<-->N
There was curiously no Parliamentary debates about prisoner voting during the passage of the 1969 or 1983 Acts .<-->N
It s thought by some political commentators that this was because the issue simply was n't considered important , as opposed to the lowering of the voting age to 18 , which Parliament agreed to in the 1969 Act .<-->O
However , in an appeal case heard by the House of Lords in 1982 , Lord Wilberforce affirmed that prisoners do not lose their civil rights simply because they have been imprisoned : '' . .<-->O
under English law , a convicted prisoner , in spite of his imprisonment , retains all civil rights which are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication .<-->O
The issue of prisoner voting was only considered again by Parliament for the Representation of the People Act 2000 .<-->N
This gave prisoners on remand the right to vote .<-->N
Although the 1983 Act only prevented convicted prisoners from voting , in practice this also included remand prisoners -LRB- i.e. those charged and detained , but not as yet convicted of any crime -RRB- because of the restrictions on registering prison as a qualified residence on the Electoral Register .<-->O
The 2000 Act therefore was not presented to Parliament as restoring a right , but simply making it practically possible to exercise an already existing right .<-->O
This was achieved by enabling prisoners on remand to register their prison address on the Electoral Register .<-->N
The government view then , as it seems to remain now with the current government , is that absence of rights , including the right to vote , is part of the punishment of a convicted prisoner . ''<-->O
European Court of Human Rights v the UK The UK s ban on all serving prisoners from voting was , in 2005 , ruled to be a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court on Human Rights based in Strasbourg .<-->N
The Court decided that : a general and automatic disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners was incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol One of the European Convention on Human Rights .<-->N
The UK was ordered to end its universal ban on convicted prisoner voting , although a partial ban would be acceptable .<-->O
The Labour government of the time managed to adroitly duck and dive the issue , and rather conveniently -LRB- for them -RRB- handed the controversy on to the next government , a coalition of Conservatives and LibDems , voted into power in May 2010 .<-->O
In November 2010 , the European Court of Human Rights gave a further six months notice to the UK to change its blanket ban on prisoner voting , or face significant consequences .<-->O
The court ruled that two prisoners who appealed to the Court had their human rights breached as a result of the voting ban , but the Court refused to award them compensation -LRB- although it did allow them to claim modest legal costs against the government . -RRB-<-->O
In December 2010 , the new government announced that it would bring forward legislation to allow offenders sentenced to less than four years in prison the right to vote in UK Parliamentary and European elections -LRB- unless the sentencing judge considered this to be inappropriate . -RRB-<-->O
However , the House of Commons , following a backbench debate on the issue in February 2011 , overwhelmingly voted to retain the current ban on all convicted prisoners from voting .<-->O
Just 22 MPs voted against continuing the ban , but 234 MPs voted in favour .<-->N
Subsequently , in March that year , the UK government appealed to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights against the Court s previous order that the UK should change its prisoner voting policy within six months .<-->O
On 11 April 2011 the Grand Chamber rejected the UK s appeal , and gave another deadline of six months from that date for new legislative proposals to be introduced in the UK on prisoner voting rights .<-->O
Since then , the UK government has requested and obtained extensions to the deadline to implement new legislation , and the Court has also accepted the UK government s argument that , member states should have a wide discretion on how they regulate a ban on prisoners voting .<-->O
In November 2012 , the UK government published a draft Bill , The Voting Eligibility -LRB- Prisoners -RRB- Draft Bill , for pre-legislative scrutiny by a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament .<-->N
The Committee published its report in December 2013 and recommended that all prisoners serving sentences of 12 months or less be allowed to vote in all UK Parliamentary , local and European elections .<-->N
However , the UK government has not responded substantively to the Committee s recommendations , and did not schedule the Bill for consideration in the current Parliament .<-->N
This means that the issue of prisoner voting will not be considered again until after the next General Election in May 2015 .<-->N
In September 2014 , the Council of Europe committee that oversees the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights , decided to postpone any decision on the issue until at least September 2015 , giving the UK and the current government and the next government a further breathing space on this issue .<-->N
If the UK ultimately refuses to obey the Court s ruling , it will be the first time one of the 47 signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights will have declined to comply with an order of the European Court of Human Rights .<-->O
In the meantime , in October 2013 , the UK s Supreme Court dismissed the claim of two prisoners both serving life sentences in England for murder that the ban on their right to vote had been a breach of their human rights .<-->O
The UK Supreme Court ruled that the blanket ban on prisoner voting was not incompatible with European Union law .<-->N
In contrast , in August this year the European Court of Human Rights upheld its earlier ruling that the blanket ban on prisoner voting was a breach of prisoners human rights .<-->O
The Court decided , though , that ten prisoners in Scottish jails who had appealed to the Court for damages were not entitled to any , as the ruling in their favour was sufficient .<-->O
Telegraph ` exclusive ' - click to read Yesterday , The Telegraph published an exclusive story , claiming that over 1,000 criminals detained in Britain were seeking compensation from the European Court of Human Rights for losing their right to vote .<-->O
In light of the Court of Human Rights earlier rulings that rejected compensation to prisoners denied a vote , I am unsure how this new appeal can possibly succeed , or even that it should .<-->O
Whilst the European Court ruled against a blanket ban on all prisoners voting , it did not rule that all prisoners needed to be given the right to vote either .<-->O
This all needs careful thought ... So , what do I think ?<-->O
Prison is generally considered to serve three key purposes : 1 .<-->N
To protect the public 2 .<-->N
To serve as a deterrent -LRB- i.e. punishment -RRB- 3 .<-->N
To reform Most prisoners have not committed crimes that warrant a life sentence .<-->N
Most will eventually be released from prison .<-->N
It s in everyone s interests that once out of prison , they do not commit any further crimes , but instead become useful members of society .<-->O
That involves reform whilst still in prison , and rehabilitating offenders to think - and act - more positively about their civic duties and responsibilities .<-->O
One of the most important contributions citizens can make to society is to take part in our democracy and vote .<-->N
It does n't make any sense to me that removing the obligation of a civic duty -LRB- i.e. voting -RRB- should be considered a `` punishment '' .<-->O
So , I don t believe that a complete , blanket ban on all prisoners from voting is useful or beneficial to society .<-->O
If we believe reform is possible , then voting should not only be a right , but actively encouraged among those prisoners who will one day return to our communities .<-->O
How that is arranged practically is something our Parliament needs to re-consider , debate and decide without further delays .<-->O
Apart from anything else , the continuing and protracted conflict on this issue with the European Court of Human Rights - the legitimate jurisdiction of which was agreed by our Parliament back in the 1960s - needs to be resolved .<-->O
The Court ruled that an automatic blanket ban on all prisoners voting is a breach of human rights , but that a voting ban on some categories of prisoners only would be acceptable .<-->O
One idea is that those convicted of sentences of less than , say , two years should not lose the right to vote ; and those who are serving longer sentences should have the right to vote restored to them a year or so before their release date .<-->O
A blanket ban on all prisoners from voting seems too drastic and is clearly incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights .<-->O
Britain was the first country to sign the Convention in 1950 , and it was British lawyers who drafted the Convention based on the English , and United States , Bill of Rights ; the French Declaration of the Rights of Man , and German Basic Law .<-->N
Winston Churchill was a strong proponent of the Convention .<-->N
At least 18 European countries , including Denmark , Finland , Ireland , Spain , Sweden and Switzerland have no ban on prisoner voting .<-->N
In France and Germany , only some prisoners are denied the vote .<-->N
European countries which do not allow prisoners any right to vote include Bulgaria , Estonia , Georgia , Hungary and Liechtenstein .<-->O
Human rights do not mean that someone can not be suitably punished or imprisoned for a crime once fairly tried and convicted .<-->O
Human rights mean that all humans deserve that society , and the State , protect them from abuse of their basic civil rights .<-->O
If the State can be allowed to abuse humans any humans , for any reasons or excuses then how can we justify laws against humans abusing other humans ?<-->O
How the State behaves must be reflective on how we want all humans to behave .<-->O
Human rights are meant to be universal , which means the rights apply to all humans without exception ; to you and to me ; even to criminals and foreigners , and even to those humans we do not like .<-->O
Once we take basic rights away from one human , we start to erode the basic protections for all humans .<-->O
If certain sets of humans are excluded from civil rights , how do you know whether you might one day be in a category of humans excluded from protection ?<-->O
It s safer to say that if you re human , you have rights , without any other qualification .<-->N
That s my vote .<-->F
What s yours ?<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prisoners should be allowed to vote Britain is overturning a ban on prisoners voting that has lasted more than a century , in response to a 2004 European Court of Human Rights ruling and advice from government lawyers that it would be costly not to comply .<-->O
The coalition is to change the law to remove the voting ban on Britain 's more than 70,000 prisoners .<-->N
As their incarceration is the result committing criminal acts against society , should prisoners still have the right to take part in that society and influence it by being able to vote in local and national elections in the UK ?<-->O
All the Yes points In most cases , the punishment does n't fit the crime Those who have a proven negetive impact on society should not have a say on how it is run Politicans aiming for the `` prisoner vote '' Police could influence their votes otherwise it is a breach of the right to not face discrimination the UK is out of step with democracy All the No points Prisoners have forfeited the right to vote by breaking the law It will cost the tax payer money !<-->O
It would ruin constituencies Prisoners should be allowed to vote In most cases , the punishment does n't fit the crime There is a strong principle in the criminal justice system that the punishment should fit the crime - the more severe the crime , the more sever the punishment .<-->O
At the moment , anyone who is serving a custodial sentence at the time of an election is unable to take part , regardless of the crime for which they were sentenced , or for how long they have been sentenced to prison .<-->O
But the whole point is , that regardless of the crime , from murder to theft to minor violence , by committing those acts you have broken the law of society .<-->O
You have said that you do not wish to comply with the laws of society .<-->N
Well , if criminals do not want to have the burden of the laws , then neither should they have the benefit of those laws for the duration of their custodial punishment .<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote Those who have a proven negetive impact on society should not have a say on how it is run If you are found guilty in a court of law of breakig the laws of a society , what right do you have to then request a change in those laws ?<-->O
It is laughable that the very people who can not conform to the laws of a society should get to have their say .<-->O
I would sooner give foreigners -LRB- who were n't in prison -RRB- the vote than give it to conficts .<-->N
A right to vote is not a right to change the laws in society .<-->O
Democrats would love to advocate that this is the case but quite simply it is not .<-->O
Politicians will not change laws on the basis of a few prisoner votes .<-->N
We must also not forget that those who are in prion are not necessarily guilty .<-->O
They may be suffering from a miscarriage of justice .<-->N
In addition , there will be people in prison who only committed menial offences which are not enough of a good reason to remove their right to vote in a society that classes itself as liberal .<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote Politicans aiming for the `` prisoner vote '' Giving prisoners the vote might cause politicians to start appealing to the `` prisoner vote '' .<-->O
We could see politicians offering reduced custodial times as a party pledge .<-->N
This is very unlikely to be the case .<-->N
Politicians are all about appealing to the majority .<-->N
As of 28 October 2010 there were 85,159 people in prison -LSB- -LSB- http://www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/resourcecentre/publicationsdocuments/index.asp?cat=85]] .<-->N
Compare this to the 61.8 million population in the UK -LSB- -LSB- http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=6]] .<-->N
Bearing these figures in mind , it is not feasible that a politician would appeal to the prisoner vote .<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote Police could influence their votes The thing that we have to worry about in giving prisoners the right to vote is the possibility of the police influencing their votes .<-->O
Given that the prison is such a closed away building from society as it is , how can we ensure that the votes cast in the prisons are legitimate ?<-->O
Any unused votes could be used by office guards themselves .<-->N
Alternatively , police could exert undue influence over the prisoners and how they vote .<-->O
Prisoners could be enticed to vote a certain way .<-->N
This serves no purpose than giving the police more votes than they are entitled to .<-->N
This could happen at any given polling station but it does n't .<-->N
These measures are being introduced as the European Court of Human Rights considers a blanket ban on voting for prisoners as a breach of human rights .<-->N
It is likely therefore that the Government will introduce many procedural safeguards to ensure that the voting rights are exercised in a similar fashion to the ones outside of prison .<-->O
Only then will they be fully meeting the expectations of the Human Rights Court which they do not wish to contravene .<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote otherwise it is a breach of the right to not face discrimination There is in fact a breach of human occurring when prisoners have a blanket ban on voting .<-->O
They are being discriminated against .<-->N
The principle for discrimination is that like cases should be treated alike .<-->O
By treating menial motoring offences akin to murders there is quite obviously a case of discrimination .<-->O
Like cases are not being treated alike .<-->N
This was the judgment of the European court of Strasbourg -LSB- -LSB- http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/nov/02/prisoners-vote-european-court-human-rights]] .<-->N
Therefore , we shoukld change the rules so that like cases are treated alike and we should taper the way in which we allow voting .<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote the UK is out of step with democracy In not allowing prisoners to vote , the UK are out of step with other democratically developed country .<-->N
You can see how far out of step the UK is when you look at the other countries that have an all out automatic ban on voting for those who are in prison .<-->N
Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Luxemburg , Romania , Russia -LSB- -LSB- .<-->N
These countries are not known for their politically evolved ways , in fact quit the opposite .<-->N
They are developing politically into a more democratic way , which is why it is surprising that the UK would hold on to the automatic ban in line with these countries bearing in mind the UK being long established as democratic .<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote Prisoners have forfeited the right to vote by breaking the law This argument takes an extreme example to prove its point .<-->O
However , if we take a look at those in prison , the majority have not ` blown people up ' .<-->N
28 % of the prison population are made up of criminals who committed violence against a person -LSB- -LSB- http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-04334.pdf]] .<-->N
These do not include sexual offences or murder .<-->N
They do include minor attacks .<-->N
How can we equate these minor offences with that of blowing things up ?<-->N
Why should people who get involved in fights be deprived of the right to vote , just the same as a murderer or arsonist ?<-->O
Voting is a privilege , not a right , and people in prison has shown they are not worthy of that privilege by breaking the law in the first place .<-->O
Is it not oxymoronic to grant someone who has broken the law a privilege granted by the law ?<-->N
If prisoners are unsatisfied with their condition , they should not have got there in the first place , and they have only themselves to blame .<-->N
If they believe their sentence is too long , then perhaps we should consider changing some other laws , but not grant this one .<-->O
Would you give someone who has recently blown someone else up the privilege of voting for the leader of our community ?<-->N
What kind of leaders do we want ?<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote It will cost the tax payer money !<-->N
Oh dear , what if people had this view before women had the vote ?<-->O
Money should be of no concern when we are dealing with justice and rights .<-->O
In addition , given the 2004 ruling of the European Court of Human rights in which it was stated that it was against the European Convention of Human Rights for the vote to be taken away for certain offences -LSB- -LSB- http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/european-court-of-human-rights]] .<-->O
Given this fact , prisoners can now take the UK Government to the European Court arguing that the UK is in breach of the Human Rights legislation .<-->N
This would costs the UK Taxpayer far more than the implementation of the correct rights in the first place .<-->O
The move to change legislation to allow most members of the prison population to vote will cost the tax payer in administration costs .<-->O
Not only will we have to pay the costs of the legislation going through both Houses of Parliament and then being sent to draftsmen and then finally to the Queen .<-->O
Not only will the taxpayer have to pay these costs , but they will also have to pay the costs of implementation .<-->O
Prisoners will have to be escorted to their voting places , then their votes will have to be collected and counted .<-->O
This would be such a lengthy procedure .<-->N
It would be much easier to not change the laws and not allow them to vote .<-->O
Prisoners should be allowed to vote It would ruin constituencies This would be easily circumvented by making the prisoners votes count towards the constituency they last resided in before their custodial sentence .<-->O
That way , there would not be an over concentration of prisoner votes in constituencies with large prisons .<-->O
The judgment does not actually mean that prisoners have to have the vote as under the European Convention the right to vote is a very qualified right .<-->O
Up until 2000 there was a blanket ban , but now people on remand before conviction or sentence can vote because they have a home address .<-->N
It would be unfair that a whole prison 's worth of voters could sway a council or a general election because the prison is so large it would affect the constituency size and count as a large part of the voters in the constituency and it would marginalise the votes of law abiding citizens in constituencies .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prisoners ` should be allowed to vote ' A 134-year-old law which deprives prisoners of the vote should be overturned , according to a new campaign .<-->N
Politicians from the three major parties were joined by church leaders and prison reform groups in the call to reverse the ban .<-->O
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said : `` If we want people to return to their communities as law-abiding citizens , we must encourage them to play a positive part in shaping their futures by their own efforts and commitment . ''<-->O
He was joined in calls to restore the vote by former Conservative minister Peter Bottomley and senior Labour MP David Winnick .<-->N
Ex-offenders ' charity Unlock and the Prison Reform Trust were also backing the campaign .<-->N
The law that strips convicted inmates of voting rights dates back to 1870 .<-->N
The Representation of the People Act 1983 contains the current legislation which bars sentenced prisoners from voting .<-->N
England and Wales have the highest imprisonment rate in the European Union , at 141 for every 100,000 of population .<-->N
Apart from the UK , seven other European countries have an automatic bar on inmates voting - Armenia , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Luxembourg and Romania .<-->N
The Bishop of Worcester , Peter Selby , the Prison Governors ' Association and Chief Inspector of Prisons Anne Owers were also backing the campaign .<-->F
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Why Should Felons Vote ?<-->N
This year , more than 600,000 people will be released from prison , returning to their families and their communities , many of them intent on starting over and building a better life .<-->O
These people face many challenges in reentering the world outside the prison walls getting a job , finding a place to live , staying out of trouble , staying away from drugs .<-->O
At first , losing the right to vote seems a long way down the list of things that are important .<-->O
But as Democracy s Ghosts shows , being an active , participating member of the community helps with rehabilitation .<-->N
It helps the community by strengthening its voting base .<-->N
And history shows that there s an inequality to disfranchisement , as many of the original Jim Crow laws were intended to disfranchise African Americans , whose voter base in some states are still affected by those laws today .<-->O
Excluding ex-felons from the polls is costly , too .<-->N
In states like Florida , there s an expensive layer of bureaucracy in place just to deal with the rights restoration process .<-->O
There are those who argue that people with felony convictions should n't be allowed to vote because they are untrustworthy in character , raising a concern about how these people would vote .<-->O
But in that case , would we exclude admitted racists or , taking that argument even further , perhaps people who do n't know enough about politics ?<-->O
Others argue that ex-felons would somehow vote for a pro-crime agenda .<-->N
It 's difficult to imagine how this would happen , and in fact it has n't happened in states or even countries where felons can vote .<-->O
In fact , disfranchisement policies are in sharp conflict with the goal of promoting public safety .<-->O
A study in Minnesota showed that felons who voted in the previous biennial election had a far lower risk of committing another crime than non-voting felons , and that this effect holds net of age , race and criminal history .<-->O
So , to use the words of evangelist Chuck Colson , opening up our democracy is in society s enlightened self-interest .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is some confusion about exactly what the government 's draft bill on prisoner voting will contain on Thursday .<-->O
What there is no confusion about , however , is that our MPs are strongly opposed to any move to extend the franchise to inmates .<-->O
In February last year , they voted by a majority of 212 -LRB- with only 22 against -RRB- to retain the current ban .<-->N
There are some who say it is foolish for our politicians to behave in this way as it will result in a confrontation with the European Court of Human Rights .<-->O
That argument does not cut much ice with me .<-->O
I do n't think we should legislate on this because Europe is telling us to .<-->N
We should legislate on it because we are a liberal democracy .<-->N
When people are locked up for crimes in this country they already have lots of things taken away from them .<-->N
Their liberty .<-->N
Their right to see their family and friends whenever they please .<-->O
Usually their job and their home .<-->N
Their basic choices about what to eat , when to eat , where to eat and so on .<-->N
It is right to deprive those who have committed crimes serious enough to warrant a jail sentence of these things .<-->O
But why should they should automatically have their right to vote removed too ?<-->O
I can see the argument for not allowing long-term prisoners and those with life sentences the vote .<-->N
But the majority of prisoners are serving short sentences and , at the time of any general election , most of them will be released before any subsequent election and hence will be affected as a free citizen by the government elected .<-->O
In the case of referenda , which tend to come around very infrequently , those results could affect the prisoner for the rest of their life .<-->O
Someone only a few months away from release in May 2011 will be now out and yet may never get the chance to vote on the electoral system used for the House of Commons .<-->N
Perhaps even more importantly , one thing that almost everyone across the political spectrum agrees on is that we need to reduce reoffending rates , which in 2011 were running at an astonishing 90 per cent for serious crime .<-->O
Giving prisoners the vote will not change this overnight .<-->N
But treating them with a little bit more respect and giving them a stake in how their society is governed is likely to be one of the things that helps .<-->O
If we want to reduce recidivism , we need to be willing to think outside the constricted box our politicians have placed themselves in on this issue .<-->O
A good start would be for the government to acknowledge on Thursday that there is a strong , principled case for some prisoners to have their democratic rights restored .<-->O
Not because Europe has told us to , but because it is right .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Of course ex-felons should have their voting rights restored .<-->N
But let s go further : There s no good reason to deny prisoners the franchise .<-->O
Recently , Hillary Clinton dramatically put voting rights back on the national agenda with an audacious call to register every American citizen when he or she turns 18 .<-->O
Voter ID laws are not new issues in our politics , but Clinton s full-throated appeal felt serious and sincere : Perhaps we will finally tackle the perverse voter disenfranchisement of minorities and the poor that still persists throughout this country .<-->O
But I ll go her one better .<-->N
If Hillary is serious about social justice and equality , I hope she does not overlook one nearly voiceless population that needs to be included in this debate : ex-convicts returning home from prison , and , yes , even incarcerated prisoners .<-->O
The United States has the most prisoners of any developed country in the world , and it has the largest total prison population of any nation .<-->N
America s prison population has increased 800 percent since 1980 , and much of the increase is due to harsher punishments for non-violent crimes .<-->O
As a result , more than 1.57 million inmates are behind bars in federal , state , and county prisons and jails at any one time .<-->N
And when you consider the estimated 12 million Americans who cycle through county jails for periods of less than a year , the total number of Americans behind bars can jump to an estimated 2.4 million .<-->N
When you factor in released inmates who are barred from voting due to felony convictions , the number of voter-disenfranchised Americans grows to an estimated 5.85 million , or 2.5 percent of the nation s voting population , according to a recent report by The Sentencing Project .<-->N
Additionally , since America consists of a patchwork of laws varying from state to state regarding the voting rights of convicted felons , many felons who have the opportunity to vote are simply unaware or are unable to overcome the bureaucratic hurdles that would allow them to vote , and as a result they become de facto disenfranchised .<-->O
Some states allow felons to vote if they are on probation , but not if they are on parole .<-->N
In Tennessee a felon s voting rights can be revoked if he is late on child support payments .<-->O
According to Myrna P rez , deputy director of the Brennan Center s Democracy Program , There are some states where it does not matter what you did , how long ago it was , how young you were , etc. .<-->N
If you have a felony conviction in the past you have lost your right to vote permanently , unless the governor specifically decides that he or she wants to pardon you .<-->O
Yet finding various creative ways to keep certain Americans off the voting rolls has not been adopted by all of America .<-->N
Vermont and Maine have both bucked the trend of voter disenfranchisement and allow inmates to vote .<-->N
In fact , Vermont s 1793 Constitution stipulates that residents can lose their right to vote only if convicted of voter fraud .<-->O
It is so obvious that marriage is outdated .<-->O
There are so many people who become unhappy because of marraige !<-->N
Just look around you , how about your parents , how about your friends ' parents , how about your relatives ?<-->N
Many of them end up separating .<-->N
Look at the high divorce rate in the USA , France , the UK , all those developed nations .<-->N
People get divorced !<-->N
Marriage is not outdated Marriage is n't outdated .<-->N
According to new york times : Marriage has become a status symbol a highly regarded marker of a successful personal life .<-->N
This transformed meaning is evident in the Obama administration s briefs in the two same-sex marriage cases now in front of the Supreme Court .<-->N
Those documents reflect , in part , the assumption that marriage represents not only a bundle of rights but also a privileged position The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results .<-->O
The divorce rate is > 50 % and there are an untold number of couples in unhappy marriages , clearly marriage is n't working .<-->O
Sure it may work for a a small percentage of the population , but they could easily have a lifelong , monogamous relationship without needing a piece of a paper to validate it .<-->O
As a society we have a tendency to see the order of a relationship as `` date , get married , have kids '' .<-->N
So many couples get married and have kids because they see it as `` the next step '' .<-->N
If we removed marriage from the equation people would start thinking about what 's right for them and not what is expected of them .<-->O
In turn I think this would lead to happier couples , less children -LRB- this would also be good for the overpopulation we have going on -RRB- , and the children that are born would be raised in a much better environment .<-->O
It 's not marriage , it 's us If you think about the history of marriage and covenant and commitment it represents , you will see that it is an institution that has been with us for generations .<-->O
So why is it outdated now ?<-->N
Its not marriage that has changed , it is us .<-->N
We have become selfish and unwilling to be patient and wait .<-->O
Too many of us are used to instant gratification and if we do n't have it , we move on to something else .<-->O
Marriage was n't designed that way .<-->N
If it were easy , it would not be near as rewarding .<-->O
The rewards come with time and commitment between two people .<-->N
Divorce is the problem , not marriage People do n't do what is needed to keep their marriage successful .<-->N
Therefore the problem is n't marriage , its divorce .<-->N
To avoid divorce all you need to do is marry the right person and then make sure that you follow through in your agreements to help and watch over your spouse .<-->O
That 's what marriage is all about .<-->N
Marriage is n't outdated .<-->N
According to new york times : Marriage has become a status symbol a highly regarded marker of a successful personal life .<-->N
This transformed meaning is evident in the Obama administration s briefs in the two same-sex marriage cases now in front of the Supreme Court .<-->N
Those documents reflect , in part , the assumption that marriage represents not only a bundle of rights but also a privileged position .<-->O
Yes I do think marriage is outdated I think marriage is just a ball and chain for people .<-->O
Why do you have to make all those legal vows and suffer the consequences when you can just live together .<-->O
I think being married holds people back form all their dreams and capability 's and its just not fair .<-->O
Its also crazy the costs of divorces nowadays I just do n't understand why people would want to put themselves through that For the government , it is .<-->O
I think that churches and such should be free to do whatever they want regarding marriage , but the government should stop caring about `` marriage '' as such .<-->O
It would solve the `` gay marriage '' debate quite handily , because every legally recognized relationship between two people would simply be known as a `` civil union '' to the government .<-->O
If everyone has a `` civil union '' then gays wo n't feel like they have anything less , and the government does n't have to worry about a definition of `` marriage '' at all .<-->O
Yes marriage is an outdated institution The traditional marriage , the traditional relationship is very much outdated to me in the modern day , and is not needed or even always realistic when it comes to a monogamous relationship as we are taught it to be .<-->O
For one thing ... .<-->N
marriage as we now it , is more meant for the state than for us , we do n't need a fancy wedding , a big church ceremony to be `` married '' to someone , we can do that all on our own without the state ever having gotten their hands into it .<-->O
It is not truly necessary , and in fact we 'd be better off without that .<-->O
Secondly ... .<-->N
though some people may feel the need for a monogamous one to one relationship more than others might , which is fine , but secondly , the idea of being tied down to one person and one person only is a bit outdated in its ' own right and more exists cause of religious tradition than anything else .<-->O
If two people trust each other , what exactly is the harm in messing around with others , or even bringing others into the relationship entirely ?<-->O
If anything the fact that many CA N'T do this ... . .<-->N
is why so many divorces occur in the first place , because the man or woman , or even both ca n't be honest about their sexual needs so they go about fulfilling them in secret .<-->O
When they get caught , the marriage falls apart and they break up .<-->N
So if you ask me , if we drop this idea of total monogamy except for those who actually truly want it , you 'll see happier couples and longer lasting marriages and relationships for it .<-->O
So yeah , marriage as we know it today is an outdated institution , a relic of an era that has long since passed us by , and is not needed any longer .<-->O
It Still Matters To say that marriage is outdated because large numbers of people fail at it is akin to saying that music is n't worth the effort because only a handful of people will become virtuosos .<-->O
Look at this different : half of marriages do well .<-->N
And in the past , a higher percentage were successful .<-->N
Perhaps the liberal sexual mores of the 60s have become outdated in the wake of so many broken homes .<-->O
It 's not marriage that 's outdated , it 's the sexual revolution that has proven itself unnecessary to human happiness .<-->O
Look at your parents ' marriage and your grandparents ' marriage .<-->N
Which one , on average , produced lifelong satisfaction ?<-->N
Millions are discovering that grandma and grandpa had something going for them when they saw each other through to the end of life .<-->N
The boomers who changed marriages like they changed socks , on the other hand , leave behind a trail of emotional scars and relational wreckage that does little to bring satisfaction in old age .<-->O
Will we toss away an institution that has served the human race well since time immemorial because of a few failed decades ?<-->N
A poor choice .<-->N
There is something invaluable to be found in a lifelong commitment - a complementing of male and female that bring a depth to human experience that can be found nowhere else .<-->O
In need of encouragement and support ?<-->O
No , it helps society .<-->N
No , marriage is not an outdated institution , because marriage is still an important institution that helps society stay together .<-->O
Marriage means a lot to the people who are married .<-->N
Marriage helps people work together , and make plans for the future and for children knowing that they will have a partner in life .<-->O
I t holds you back from your dreams .<-->N
Unless your partner shares the same dreams These days its hard to find girls that are career driven .<-->O
They do n't know how much work goes into a career and therefore ask you to choose her or your career .<-->O
Unless you buy a wife from asia then I think it will work .<-->O
I think buying wifes will be the new thing No marriage is important in life : Yes marriage has gone on for years but think on a scale of 1 to 10 how much do you want to have children and be married ?<-->O
Students gave heartfelt reasons for why marriage is a personal choice , should be ` judged ' on a case-by-case basis and should be respected if that 's what couples want to do .<-->O
They also said it would be wrong to dismiss marriage for all the hundreds of thousands of couples that are already married how do you know if it 's right for you until you 're actually in that situation ?<-->O
Some people think that marriage is not out of date : Firstly , marriage takes away the casual state of a cohabitation relationship .<-->N
If the couple ended up having children , it would give the child a far more stable environment as marriage represents a legal bond which protects both the husband and wife in a relationship .<-->N
Even though divorce rates are high , the remarriage rate shows that even people who go through failed marriages retain faith in the idea of marriage .<-->O
Also , marriage is an important institution to religious people .<-->N
Marriage is an important part of most major religions , particularly Christianity , where it is one of the sacraments .<-->O
Marriage is a spiritual and legal commitment to the one that you love .<-->O
While there are still such huge numbers of people who practice religions to which marriage is integral , marriage can not be outdated .<-->O
-------------------------------------------- Some are predicting that marriage will soon be a thing of the past perhaps within a generation .<-->O
Fundamental shifts in today s thinking are impacting society s evaluation of this time-honored tradition .<-->O
The article Who Needs Marriage ?<-->N
A Changing Institution highlighted this growing phenomenon : marriage , whatever its social , spiritual or symbolic appeal , is in purely practical terms just not as necessary as it used to be .<-->O
Long-lasting relationships are becoming increasingly elusive .<-->N
Many struggle to find happiness in their lives only to watch their visions , goals and expectations evaporate into heartbreak and failure .<-->O
Yet happy , healthy marriages have one of the greatest impacts on people s lives .<-->O
Why then has the institution of wedlock , which has existed in various forms in all cultures from earliest times , become so unpopular ?<-->N
Stunning Statistics America leads the world in divorce .<-->N
Current figures show that 41-50 percent of first marriages fail .<-->N
Second-marriage failure rates stand at 60-67 percent .<-->N
Even more staggering is that third marriages face a 73 to 74 percent failure rate !<-->N
While divorce rates are not yet as high in other countries , the number of broken homes is increasing , with Russia and eastern European countries presently showing the highest spikes in divorce .<-->O
In Canada , 37.7 percent of all marriages are expected to end before a couple s 30th anniversary .<-->N
Divorce rates are also climbing in India .<-->F
BBC News reported that the chances of this year s newly-weds staying together for the rest of their lives are slimmer than ever .<-->N
There has been a huge change , a drastic change and divorce rates are increasing , Dr Geetanjali Sharma , a marriage counsellor working in Gurgaon , a wealthy Delhi satellite city , told the BBC .<-->O
There s been a 100 % increase in divorce rates in the past five years alone .<-->N
With such bleak statistics , many are now seeking alternatives that seem more attractive than traditional vows .<-->O
After all , many say , Who needs a piece of paper stating they are legally married ?<-->N
As a result , cohabitation , once illegal and frowned upon as living in sin , has now become socially acceptable .<-->O
But does living together produce positive effects ?<-->N
Studies indicate that cohabitation produces even worse results than troubled marriages .<-->N
The CDC s National Center for Health Statistics ... found that the probability of a first marriage ending in separation or divorce within five years is 20 percent , compared with the 49 percent probability of a pre-marital cohabitation breaking up within the same time period , CNN reported .<-->N
After 10 years , the study found , a first marriage has a 33 percent chance of ending compared with a 62 percent chance for cohabitations .<-->N
A few model marriages do still exist , but it is becoming increasingly rare to find couples who have been happily married for several decades .<-->O
The growing marriage-failure rate around the world has led people to believe that marriage is simply becoming outdated .<-->O
A closer look reveals why such a change is occurring .<-->N
Increased Urbanization Over the last 70 to 80 years , an unprecedented migration from rural to urban areas has taken place .<-->N
With millions relocating to ever-expanding cities , the home-life of many is experiencing previously unheard of complexities .<-->N
CNN reported that more couples in developing nations are unhappy because of the changing roles brought on by the modern lifestyle .<-->N
Old and new cultures are clashing .<-->N
For example , many men in Asia and Africa want their wives to be progressive and modern .<-->O
Yet they also want them to be homemakers and wives .<-->N
Unable to cope with fulfilling both roles , many women are abandoning their marriages and seeking divorces .<-->N
The husband s former role as leader , provider and protector is rapidly diminishing .<-->N
The wife s responsibility as homemaker , caregiver and mother has also morphed into that of additional breadwinner to shore up the household budget .<-->N
Instead of needing one another as in bygone times , urban home life has , in many instances , become a mere cold business relationship .<-->N
Husbands and wives may share a home , but not their lives .<-->N
As traditional male and female roles are increasingly abandoned , it has created confusion on the part of both parties .<-->O
Urbanization is just one factor that is creating strain on marriages .<-->O
There are others .<-->N
Permissiveness and Immorality A changing worldwide social outlook is adding to the demise of marital relationships , and declining religious values continue to break down the walls of wedlock .<-->O
Prevalent restraints of the past have become so relaxed that even those reared in the most proper circles now openly promote alternative lifestyles .<-->O
Prior to WWI , the subject of sex was rarely discussed publicly .<-->N
But since that time , the floodgates of everything sex have been flung wide open .<-->N
Permissive liberalism has marred the concept that traditional marriage relationships no longer fit within today s expectations .<-->O
Attitudes glamorizing fornication , adultery , and every form of promiscuity permeate society through literature , movies and the arts .<-->N
Jokes ridiculing wedlock and unfaithful celebrities routinely make headlines instead of good examples of loyalty and fidelity .<-->O
Many of the world s educators and psychiatrists are at the forefront in promoting immorality .<-->N
Even some theologians advocate healthy , adulterous relationships and trial marriages .<-->O
It has become difficult for any marriage not built on a solid foundation to survive this engulfing onslaught !<-->O
This increasing immoral explosion is directly linked to the selfishness of society as a whole .<-->O
Never before in history has there existed an age so geared toward the idea of me first .<-->N
As many people s attention spans have dwindled to almost zero , so has the idea that a relationship should last beyond a few momentary thrills .<-->O
Consequently , marriage , as with so much in society , has become a throw-away commodity even perceived by some as mere household garbage to be used and thrown out .<-->O
It seems that a vow no longer means till death do us part , but rather for as long as I am getting something .<-->O
Society has come to believe it can have it all without accountability , responsibility or consequence for its actions .<-->N
But with all the focus on self-gratification and self-fulfillment , the lives of those most impacted are frequently overlooked , neglected and forgotten .<-->N
Vulnerable Victims Whether in marriages presently headed for divorce or those already rent asunder , little concern is given to those most affected children .<-->O
Numerous youngsters today occupy homes without one or both of their biological parents , according to the article , The Child Advocate : Divorce Effects on Children .<-->N
Divorce is an intensely stressful experience for all children , regardless of age or developmental level The pain experienced by children at the beginning of a divorce is composed of : a sense of vulnerability as the family disintegrates , a grief reaction to the loss of the intact family Toddlers especially suffer from sleep disturbances and an exacerbated fear of separation from the custodial parent .<-->O
-LSB- Older children -RSB- often grieve openly for the departed parent and harbor feelings of powerlessness and acute depression -LRB- ibid . -RRB- .<-->O
Is it any wonder that these impressionable , young people will grow up with unstable and unbalanced views toward marriage , sex and home life ?<-->O
These adolescent minds can not help but become scarred and calloused toward such an institution that brings true happiness , stability , peace of mind , and everything good one could desire .<-->O
History shows that the family has been a bastion of civilization for centuries .<-->N
As the marriage institution crumbles , however , so does civilization .<-->O
Consider this quote from Dr. Patrick Fagan , who authored a report showing that broken marriages impact half of U.S. teens .<-->N
The decrease of strong families in the United States has major implications for the nation , and by extension , the rest of the world , he said .<-->O
A nation is only as strong as its citizens , and a lack of strong families weakens human , social , and moral capital , which in turn directly affects the financial -LRB- and thus indirectly the military and foreign policy strength -RRB- of the United States .<-->O
A great nation depends on great families , but weak families will build a weak nation .<-->O
Certainly , this is true not only of the United States , but also all other countries in which divorce is becoming increasingly common .<-->O
Ultimate Purpose Many today can plainly see that traditional marriage and the family unit are breaking down .<-->O
Most stand by and wring their hands in despair at what is occurring .<-->N
Others offer Band-Aid solutions to this gaping societal wound .<-->N
Counselors and advisers write endless articles and books in an attempt to help .<-->N
Yet no one understands or will address the most important question that could lead them to the real solutions why marriage in the first place ?<-->O
The answer is a vital key that will lead to a long-lasting and successful marriage .<-->O
Where did marriage begin ?<-->N
Most people believe it evolved over time from various cultural customs .<-->N
It is this lack of knowledge that has hidden the very purpose for marriage .<-->O
To enjoy a wonderful , productive and stable marriage , its true beginning must first be considered .<-->O
Only one reliable account provides the answers the world s best-selling book of all time , the Bible which gives a record of when marriage was first instituted .<-->N
The first marriage is recorded in the book of Genesis , at the creation of the first two human beings , Adam and Eve .<-->N
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and he slept : and He took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ; And the rib , which the Lord God had taken from man , made He a woman , and brought her unto the man .<-->N
And Adam said , This -LSB- is -RSB- now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man -LRB- Gen. 2:21 -23 -RRB- .<-->N
Verses 24-25 further reveal that God also created sex : Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife -LSB- not common-law or live-in partner -RSB- : and they shall be one flesh .<-->N
And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .<-->N
God saw everything that He had created and said it was good including marriage and sex , which was created for the sole purpose of the marriage relationship between man and woman to unite them as one flesh and to allow them to show love toward one another .<-->O
The Bible shows that sex outside of marriage results in terrible penalties .<-->N
King David s lust and adultery with Bathsheba led to much suffering .<-->O
While he repented of his mistake and was forgiven , this selfish act resulted in the murder of Bathsheba s husband , Uriah -LRB- a great and noble warrior in Israel at that time -RRB- , and the loss of an illegitimate son which brought David and Bathsheba great sorrow -LRB- II Sam .<-->O
11:3 -27 -RRB- .<-->N
God is no respecter of persons .<-->F
When man rejects God s laws and instructions and decides for himself the way to go , he is guaranteed to reap the fruits of his doings .<-->F
Time-tested Solutions In the end , two philosophies prevail in life .<-->N
One is the way of selfishness and self-centeredness a person doing what is right in his own eyes a way that ends in ruin .<-->O
The other sincere outgoing concern for the welfare and well-being of others leads to everything good .<-->O
Upon this way are based a great number of time-honored principles that bring wonderful blessings to any marriage .<-->O
Some of these include 100 percent commitment acceptance appreciation building on strengths giving praise being realistic forsaking selfishness remembering the small things and always being forgiving .<-->O
Consider this excerpt from David C. Pack s booklet You Can Build a Happy Marriage : Happiness depends far more on what you do than on what your mate or anyone else does .<-->N
No matter the current state of your marriage , you can improve it .<-->N
Take responsibility .<-->N
You can grow and it can get better .<-->N
While this may take much work , not coming easily or overnight , the by-product is that much better times lie ahead for all those willing to follow God s principles for building a truly happy marriage !<-->O
These timeless principles outlined in the Bible ensure that individual marriages need never be in danger of failure or ever become outdated .<-->O

5 Necessary Qualities For A Happy Marriage Consider creating an alternative ritual of commitment .<-->N
Domestic partnerships are a path many couples are taking .<-->N
A marriage alternative can look like a legal union in every way , or it might simply be a verbal agreement .<-->O
Domestic partnerships are available to both same-sex and different-sex couples and allow for legal rights similar to those of a married couple -LRB- property ownership , support obligations etc -RRB- .<-->O
Consider possible legal reasons for tying the knot .<-->N
Health insurance is certainly a benefit when one spouse has it and the other needs it .<-->O
With children , you also gain tax benefits when you get married .<-->N
In addition , there can be intangible benefits for your kids : a committed relationship between two parental figures .<-->N
This of course can also happen without marriage , but sometimes it feels more real for kids if their parents have tied the knot .<-->N
-------------------- According to the most recent statistics , the divorce rate , often quoted -LRB- even by this author in classes -RRB- as 50 % of marriages , is actually closer to the low 40 percentile .<-->O
-LRB- Divorce Rate : It 's Not as High as You Think , By Dan Hurley , The New York Times , April 19 , 2005 -RRB- .<-->N
But that does not negate the fact that the United States has the highest divorce rate in the world per capita .<-->O
The fact that so many American marriages end in divorce leads to the question is marriage an outdated institution ?<-->O
I think the answer is dependent on some of your personal variables .<-->N
First , let us look at the facts : over 40 % of marriages end in divorce .<-->O
This does not simply infer that the in tact marriages are happy .<-->O
This author attended a lecture by a respected psychiatrist , rabbi , and author who suggested that another half of the in-tact marriages were unhappy .<-->N
Per capita , the United States has the highest divorce rate in the world .<-->N
The average duration of a marriage in the U.S is about 7 to 8 years .<-->N
And although marriage is an institution which makes childrearing most efficacious , marriages in which there are children end in divorce with a higher frequency than those marriages without children .<-->O
Yet marriage remains an institution that many would not think of doing away with or even restructuring .<-->O
Likely even the question of marriage being an outdated institution raises eyebrows .<-->O
A controversial issue in this country currently is whether gays should have the right to marry , again showing the attachment to this social institution .<-->O
Many young people would n't dream of not getting married .<-->O
In fact , many women have been dreaming about their impending nuptials since they were young children .<-->O
This is not only true for women , as many men assume marriage and children are a foregone conclusion in their lives .<-->N
So what is this author 's argument that the idea of marriage might be outdated ?<-->O
Well , beyond the statistics above , I also believe that as the Dali Lama said , `` Our purpose in life is to be happy .<-->O
From the very core of our being , we simply desire contentment . ''<-->O
This is becoming more and more true today , as more people seek happiness .<-->O
Marriage is a source of lasting happiness for some , but for others it is only a temporary high .<-->N
The first argument that marriage might be outdated is the divorce rate .<-->O
Marriage has been around as an institution since , well , according to anything found in this author 's research , ancient time .<-->N
It was reported as necessary for childrearing , property disbursement , and bloodline .<-->N
In these times it was more necessary to have a partnership to survive .<-->N
Even more than partnerships , tribes were necessary for survival .<-->N
As times changed , neighborhoods became like tribes , and small communities worked together to enhance the lives of all .<-->N
But Western civilization has continued to move toward a more individualistic culture .<-->N
Today people are less likely to even socialize with their neighbors , let alone rely on them .<-->O
It is true some areas are bound by their neighborhood , and the community works together to enhance the life of its members .<-->N
But this is becoming less and less true .<-->O
As an example , how many `` daycare centers '' for children were there 50 years ago ?<-->N
As this culture becomes more individual focused , bonds with others for survival becomes less important .<-->O
We now pay people to do the things we used to accomplish in a partnership .<-->N
Restaurants and fast food chains , once relegated to occasional family outings , are a main source of nourishment .<-->N
There are agencies that will deliver `` home-cooked meals '' to you or have them ready for pick-up .<-->N
Cleaning staff , once limited to the rich or to businesses , are being used by the middle-class .<-->N
Both parents are working , focusing on their careers , their paths toward self individuation , and more tedious tasks like yard work are being hired out .<-->O
The point , partnerships are less necessary than they were 60 years ago .<-->O
That is the social reason that the institution of marriage may be outdated .<-->N
But the social influence does not stand alone .<-->N
These changes impact individuals and individuals make up a marriage .<-->N
So what are some of the individual characteristics that may contribute to marriage being an outdated concept ?<-->N
First , as discussed above , it is the desire for individuation by those in a marriage .<-->N
More and more often people want to have meaning in their life , beyond raising a family .<-->N
We are culture whose individuals want to be different .<-->N
Americans want to stand out .<-->N
They want to feel they accomplished something for themselves .<-->O
As such , simply supporting a partner to achieve feels inadequate to many .<-->O
They also want to achieve , and to be supported in their endeavors .<-->N
This alone can contribute to strife in a marriage .<-->N
Whose needs come first ?<-->N
How long do I put my goals on the back burner to help you attain yours ?<-->O
When can I pursue my happiness ?<-->N
Another aspect of this is the drive toward excitement and experience .<-->N
For some people , experience is more important than possessions .<-->N
Some people just enjoy experience , for its own sake .<-->O
They may be thrill seekers , or may just place a high value on novel experiences .<-->O
These people just enjoy doing new things and meeting new people .<-->O
At one point in time these characters might have been explorers , adventurers , or other types of risk takers .<-->O
It seems though , that this is becoming much more common as a character trait these days .<-->N
And folks with this character trait are likely to find the routine of marriage stifling .<-->N
There are other reasons that marriages may fail that are related to society .<-->N
For one , despite many marriages failing or being unhappy , we live in a culture that romanticizes marriage .<-->O
People are constantly told they will find their soul mate , that if this relationship does n't workout , another will come along who might be `` the one . ''<-->O
In reality , how often are you able to accurately predict who your `` one '' is ?<-->N
Most people getting married believe they found the one .<-->N
And when that does n't work and they remarry , they often believe this time they found the one .<-->N
And this is n't limited only to those who marry .<-->N
How many people did you get romantically involved with who at some point you thought were probably `` the one '' ?<-->O
Perhaps this concept , which shows no signs of dying despite the evidence against it , is at worst mere wishful thinking , or at best , a long-shot .<-->O
Along with this idea of marriage being romanticized is the desire to simply have a wedding .<-->O
First , a wedding is a beautiful thing .<-->N
The pageantry , the pomp , and the beauty of it all results in it being majestic .<-->O
Everyone should have one .<-->N
It just does n't seem they should have to stay together forever as a result .<-->O
In a recent discussion with a colleague who was discussing marriage , she reported she wanted to get married .<-->N
It was n't that she necessarily wanted to marry the guy she was with , but that she wanted to get married to someone .<-->N
She discussed the beauty of a wedding , and how it would be a shame to miss out on that .<-->O
Everyone wants to be Cinderella or Prince Charming for a night .<-->N
This is not uncommon thinking .<-->O
But does the expectation have to be that they will stay together for a lifetime ?<-->N
-LRB- There was an article two years ago about a politician in a European country advocating a law that marriages expire after seven years , with the opportunity to renew .<-->O
Of course she was mocked and ridiculed -RRB- .<-->N
Another point of discussion for why marriages may fail focuses on the fact that many people get married before having been on their own .<-->O
Recently one of my students , when discussing her relationship , actually said she did n't want to be alone for the rest of her life .<-->O
She could n't have been more than 27 , although early 20 's is more likely .<-->O
For some reason this is a predominant fear in our culture -LRB- this could evolve into an existential discussion , but that is better placed in another article -RRB- .<-->O
There seems to be a myth that if you do n't find someone , and latch onto them , you will be lonely and miserable , possibly for the rest of your life .<-->O
Many people seem to settle so they do n't have to face this fear .<-->O
Ultimately , this fear becomes less predominant , and the person may leave the marriage .<-->O
But the real culprit was the fear leading to settling .<-->O
Too often , marriage is an attempt to posses another .<-->N
When humans love someone , they are afraid to let them go .<-->O
People are afraid of loss .<-->N
And what better way to secure someone than marriage ?<-->O
Marriage provides a -LCB- false -RCB- sense of security .<-->O
It definitely makes ending the relationship more difficult .<-->N
But beyond just the fear of being alone is the fact that if you have n't been on your own you are used to a cycle of dependency .<-->O
First people are dependent on their caregivers .<-->N
And if they go from this state to one of marriage , they have never really been independent .<-->N
There has always been someone else helping out .<-->N
Outside of simply being dependent , there is a level of maturation that comes from living on your own and not being in a romantic relationship .<-->O
One learns to nurture oneself , to care for oneself , to be independent in the truest sense of the word .<-->O
Unfortunately , many who enter marriage have never really experienced this .<-->N
This discussion of personal growth leads me to another point regarding how the changing times have altered individual 's character .<-->N
These days more people are interested in their own personal growth .<-->N
As people grow and change the risk of growing apart increases .<-->N
When most people in their forties think of what they were like in their twenties , they can usually see the tremendous changes that have occurred .<-->O
This is even truer when personal growth is a goal .<-->N
And with one or even both partners growing and changing , the potential for growth in opposing directions is a possibility .<-->O
And even if you do n't grow apart , there is the possibility of a loss of attraction for your partner , and growing attraction for others you meet on your path .<-->O
Attraction is one of my favorite areas of psychology .<-->N
The reason one individual is attracted to another is rich with possibility .<-->O
For some , there is a reminiscence of something deeply enjoyed in the past .<-->N
A client recently discussed how the attraction to each of her recent relationships related to two important men in her life .<-->N
This is excellent evidence of this phenomenon .<-->N
For some people they believe this person they are with is the best they will ever be able to get .<-->O
Sometimes this comes from feelings of low self esteem , but this is not always the case .<-->O
Often there is a bargaining process which goes on inside of us when considering a romantic partner .<-->N
We have this much beauty , smarts , financial potential , humor , etc , and we want equal value .<-->O
Too much value and we might be insecure .<-->O
Too little , and well we are getting the short end of the stick .<-->N
But beyond all of this is the most common reason one individual is attracted to another : early childhood memory .<-->N
This article is not the appropriate place for this discussion , so I refer the reader to `` A General Theory of Love '' by Lewis , Amini , and Lannon .<-->N
In short the above book systematically provides a theory that purports that all experiences , but most importantly early childhood experiences , affect the choices we make in close relations .<-->O
If we had dysfunction in our home , we continue this pattern in other relations .<-->N
This leads to another reason marriages may not remain in tact as they used to , and hence may be an outdated concept .<-->O
Bluntly , pathology is less accepted now .<-->N
In the past , abuse , issues of control , alcoholism , addiction , and mental illness were hidden in a closet .<-->O
These days ' people are more psychologically informed .<-->N
They are more aware that being mistreated is not acceptable , that it is not a reflection on them .<-->N
They are less likely to tolerate behavior which contributes to their unhappiness .<-->O
And furthermore , they are more likely than their predecessors to read self-help books , engage in therapy and resolve the issues that result in staying somewhere they are unhappy .<-->O
They are even more likely to resolve the issues that lead to the attraction to begin with , which would result in the attraction dissipating .<-->O
So is marriage an outdated concept ?<-->N
It is possible after reading this article you may think this author believes so .<-->O
And for many people , I do believe marriage is an outdated concept .<-->N
And I am not alone , although likely in the minority -LRB- judging from the comments posted on the article `` On Marriage : Let 's Call the Whole Thing Off '' posted on MSN June 228 , 2009 -RRB- .<-->N
But I do marriage counseling , and believe marriage is right for many other people .<-->O
The goal is to find if you are right for marriage .<-->N
And ultimately whether marriage is an outdated concept or not is a personal decision .<-->N
Some of the things you might look at before making the decision are your motives for marriage .<-->O
Are you buying into a preconceived notion of what is supposed to be , without evaluating your values ?<-->O
Have you been planning your wedding since you were young and do you just refuse to give up on the dream , regardless of how your personality might affect long term commitment ?<-->O
Are you devoutly religious , and believe that pleasing God comes before personal happiness ?<-->O
If you believe marriage is for you , and you have evaluated your motives , then far be it for any article to sway you .<-->N
Just realize marriage is work , and it will be important to forgo your happiness at times to maintain the marriage .<-->O
And keep your hope .<-->N
Even if marriage is an outdated concept , everyone has the right to make the choices they make .<-->O
Good luck on your path .<-->N
------------------------ The Background : Marriage may be `` for better or worse , till death us do part '' in the words of the Book of Common Prayer but it seems that fewer and fewer of us believe those traditional words to hold true .<-->O
Marriage rates in the UK are at an all time low , with 4 out of 10 of those marriages expected to end in divorce .<-->N
And getting a divorce is becoming easier too - with advent of `` cyber divorce '' a marriage can be history in the click of a mouse .<-->O
It seems the institution of marriage may be in crisis .<-->N
It is a trend that is worrying church leaders , prompting the Church of England to publish its own rescue plan .<-->N
The Archbishop of Canterbury says the consumer culture has contributed to the breakdown of marriage , that people are encouraged to believe `` there will always be something better , faster , shinier just around the corner '' .<-->O
But is marriage really the cornerstone of a stable society ?<-->O
The Prince of Wales , Nelson Mandela , the person next door - divorce is everywhere .<-->N
But does divorce really lead to social breakdown ?<-->O
Is it worse to stay in an unhappy marriage `` for the sake of the children '' ?<-->O
Is it realistic to expect two people to live together for a lifetime ?<-->N
Or do you think that a throwaway culture is to blame for the increasing number of marriage breakdowns ?<-->O
What do you think ?<-->N
Is marriage an out-dated institution ?<-->N
Background Your reaction Your Reaction : Read the first comments we received What is outdated is trying to get everybody to behave like everybody else .<-->O
Personally , I 'd like to be in a group marriage .<-->N
More diversity , wisdom , and love , more adults per child , more stable should someone leave - all under one roof .<-->O
I 'm sure many reading this would love to impose their religion/morality on me .<-->O
That is what 's outdated .<-->N
Our world is too diverse now to have a moral consensus that goes beyond small groups .<-->O
Quite often people sitting in church next to each other ca n't even agree .<-->N
Steve , USA Marriage should be opened up to same-sex couples as marriage is meant to be the celebration of a union of people .<-->N
Marriage is becoming outdated because not everybody in society is allowed to access it K Newton , UK I am very sad to see so many anti-marriage comments and so much negativity regarding the whole subject .<-->O
Marriage is an extremely fulfilling state but only if you are prepared to work at it .<-->N
Of course it is n't always easy but then what is ?<-->N
Carla Rotch , UK Most of those who consider marriage to be an outdated institution ground this opinion on the idea that marriage is essentially an encroachment of tradition and religion on personal liberty .<-->O
Those who have expressed themselves in the opposite sense appear to be inspired either by religion or by traditional views on family values .<-->O
All these opinions are relevant and worthy of consideration and society should cater to them all , in all their diversity .<-->O
Be it noted that the decision to get married -- or divorced -- may be taken for all the wrong reasons , but it is never taken lightly ; even in this day and age marriages are normally intended to last a lifetime .<-->O
And although those who have spoken out in favour of individual freedom and choice appear overwhelmingly to be men , it is a fact that in Western society divorce proceedings are , in the large majority of cases , initiated by women -- there are conclusions to be drawn from that fact .<-->O
Peter , Netherlands Marriage is just one option amongst many .<-->N
It should not be confined to two people , but any group of committed adults , not exclusively heterosexual .<-->N
There is no biological basis for an isolated lifelong monogamous mating pair in our species ; that is merely a cultural adaptation .<-->O
What should be mourned is the demise of the tribe , the extended family , the community that raised children in its midst collectively .<-->N
What kind of substitute is the digital , global village ?<-->N
We still give in to our physical heritage and seek company from many sources .<-->N
Let 's hope some of us can find happiness , whatever name and fancy dressing we give that sociable human desire for companionship .<-->O
Jillymac , UK As a religious person I do believe ` that which God has joined , no man shall put asunder ' .<-->O
Religion or religious beliefs apart , I believe that marriage or married life is a continuous adjustment between two persons -LRB- husband and wife -RRB- each of who has his or her own defects or short-comings .<-->O
T.Philip Mathai , India No I do n't think that marriage is an outdated institution .<-->N
Although I would like to point out that coming to London from Zimbabwe I was shocked to see how few people seem to value the importance of family and children within wedlock .<-->O
I seem to be old fashioned at 27 .<-->N
Paula van Zyl , London I think the concept of a lifetime 's commitment is outmoded , seeing as we mostly live until a very ripe old age these days .<-->O
Perhaps the marriages should work on a rolling contract system - renew your vows if you wish , or get out if you wish , on say , a three-yearly basis !<-->O
We all change so much during our adult years , particularly in our 20s and 30s , and thus couples often find little in common with each other any longer .<-->O
Shirley , UK A society based upon the solid commitment of heterosexual marriage is the only stable one .<-->O
Marriage is indeed the bedrock of a stable society .<-->N
How can anyone be so blind as not to see the damage , heartache , pain , and trouble broken marriages have on the children within them , and society as a whole ?<-->O
Not too mention the effects on children who 's parents have never married and have also broken up .<-->N
The evidence of the adverse effects of non-marriage and broken marriages is everywhere , but selfishness is mentally blinding to the pain of others , and only preoccupied with the pleasures of ones self !<-->O
Ironically , such selfishness can never bring happiness to a person !<-->O
If only people could understand that the Laws of God as defined within the Bible were given for the health , happiness and welfare of humanity .<-->O
To depart from these laws mean a departure from a healthy , happy and wholesome society !<-->O
Paul Didcott , UK I 'm not sure if marriage is outdated but it is certainly not necessary .<-->O
If one is committed to another that is all you need .<-->N
No marriage is going to make someone committed .<-->N
Brian Curtis , USA I for one would not get married for a great deal of reasons including costs , period of time to get a divorce , it will compound my current problems and basically it 's not worth the piece of paper it 's written on .<-->O
Life is far to fast and busy for people nowadays to consider marriage and as a result of this , we are not meeting our soul mates with whom we should be spending the rest of our lives .<-->O
Jason , UK Having failed in one marriage , and seen the blight of the legal system on my private life , I would be tempted to say marriage is dead .<-->N
However with a second sound marriage I see clearly the importance of a strong sound respectful relationship .<-->O
Marriage is the result of human needs .<-->N
Whatever the church or state decide , people will always make a commitment to each other in some form or other .<-->O
Gwyn Jones , France Until divorce is made harder marriage will remain a devalued institution .<-->N
Mike Rotch , UK I know far more people in committed relationships who have stayed together than people whose marriages have survived .<-->N
PGH , London Marriage will become `` outdated '' when civilisation itself becomes outdated and man ceases to be a social and communal being .<-->O
As the family goes , so goes the culture in which it grows or crumbles .<-->N
Joyce Nelson , USA As with many developments in technology also sociological trends are shaking up the traditional way of thinking .<-->N
The problem is that the political establishment can not keep up with this pace of change .<-->N
The institution of marriage is as accepted as an institution as the divorce rates show .<-->N
In the end it is just a formalisation of a relationship to meet outdated standards , which are still embedded in society .<-->O
The trend can not be stopped and it is most likely a matter of a generation -LRB- s -RRB- before the whole idea of marriage disappears .<-->O
Maybe the next thing in line will be `` vows of caring '' , which binds you to take care of the children if any after the parents decide to go their own way .<-->O
Who knows ??? Robert van Hamersveld , Netherlands It 's not an outdated institution , but I think people have a negative attitude towards it .<-->O
Lainie , US Marriage will never be outdated .<-->N
It is a sacred institution in which people should join their minds , bodies , and souls together under the blessing of God for a lifetime .<-->O
It is no less important just because many people today tend to minimise and defile it .<-->O
Tiffany Moore , U.S. .<-->N
As our civilisation crumbles , so do its institutions such as marriage .<-->N
The traditional family has been under attack for a long time .<-->O
As we enter into a `` Brave New World '' of `` designer children '' through genetic engineering , death determined by `` quality of life scales '' and a New Age belief that most of the world 's human population should be exterminated , marriage is seen as an obstacle to ushering in the `` New World Order . ''<-->O
Charlie Chance , USA I think marriage is a great institution for those who wish to join it .<-->O
I think its become something that we do because we grew up thinking that marriage was the only way to be complete and for some people that 's probably true , is it outdated ?<-->O
I do n't think so , I think there 's a lot to be proud of if you can marry and keep that marriage happy for a long time .<-->O
Dave , Seattle/USA Marriage is a religiously motivated institution and as religion is seen less and less in a favourable light because of the problems it causes around the world , so too will the whole concept of marriage which will slowly die as the years pass by ... and good riddance too !!<-->O
ROL , UK The institution of marriage is not outdated , it is just outdated expectations of marriage that are being discarded .<-->O
Marriage is a lifestyle choice that should only be for as long as it is mutually satisfactory .<-->O
I feel there are enough examples to show that modern children are strong enough and aware enough to cope with their parents ' choices .<-->O
It is a world of diversity that we live in and thankfully we are all free to choose the lifestyle that suits us .<-->O
Some may find such views too liberal .<-->O
Happily no one today lives their life trying to please them .<-->N
Tom , Australia The only public declaration of love and commitment I need to make -LRB- and have made -RRB- is to my partner and our son .<-->O
We are confident , happy and secure in our relationship and do not need church or state to sanctify it .<-->O
Fine for those who wish to do so , but a marriage is born of commitment , not vice-versa .<-->O
Jack H - committed and happily unmarried , UK Marriage is God-ordained for a very good reason .<-->O
Because within the commitment of marriage people learn to put others ' needs before themselves , rather than the selfishness that exists in society today which is the root cause of all social ills .<-->O
Linda Baker , USA Marriage has got a bad reputation through the high divorce rate and some high profile celebrity break ups .<-->O
Happy marriage does n't make news in the same way .<-->N
Yet for every couple who divorce , there are two couples that remain happily married .<-->N
We should n't forget that .<-->N
Rosa , UK Marriage is an institution that forms the base for all social institutions .<-->N
It is largely due to the breakdown and criticism of marriage that society is experiencing such upheaval .<-->O
Marriage has not become less relevant , people have become lazier , and the taboos surrounding divorce have all but disappeared .<-->O
This means that people feel that they can just bail out of marriage when pleasure is not being had or when things become even slightly difficult .<-->O
Gawain , UK Most people do not differentiate between a ` wedding ' and a ` marriage ' .<-->N
A ceremony -LRB- legal or religious -RRB- , or the lack of it , does not necessarily imply that one is ` married ' or not .<-->O
` Marriage ' is an emotional and spiritual commitment which can not be dictated by religion or law .<-->O
If people spent as much time planning their ` marriages ' as they do planning their ` weddings ' , perhaps we would have more relationships surviving the test of time .<-->O
Sangeeta , Norway/India Yes , it is irrelevant .<-->N
If people want to be together , surely they will .<-->O
If a couple does n't want to be together , why should their pain be drawn out unnecessarily by the formal bond of matrimony ?<-->O
Parting may be the wise solution , and should not be penalised with legal wranglings .<-->N
Marriage may be a way for the authorities to keep track of people , but may not always add much to the relationship itself .<-->N
That remains purely in the hearts of the -LRB- lucky -RRB- couple .<-->N
Bert , Holland A commitment between two people to live together and share financial responsibilities , is a private affair that , perhaps , need not be formalised by state or church sanction .<-->O
However , once children come into the picture , the whole scene changes .<-->N
At this point , the responsibilities become greater than just two people enjoying a mutual convenience - they now have to provide a secure and nurturing environment to raise their children , and society still accepts marriage as the only practical means to accomplish that .<-->O
Until we come up with something better , and something that is acceptable to the whole of society , that 's the way it is .<-->O
Mark M Newdick , USA/UK All I have to say is that if I do get married , it will because I am in love and devoted to someone , not to prove anything to anyone else .<-->O
I want to prove to my partner that I am committed to him and only him .<-->N
C Jones , UK Why should a personal relationship between two people be subject to some form of cultural regime which is insensitive to the peculiarities of individual relationships .<-->N
I think these unrelenting moral dictators should refrain from prescribing life styles to the rest of us .<-->O
This arrogance in my opinion is at the roots of all fascist thinking .<-->O
Riva , Netherland If couples wish to live together then it is their choice .<-->N
If they want to marry then it is their choice .<-->N
If mixed race couples want to cohabit or marry it is their choice .<-->N
If same sex couples want to cohabit or marry , then that should be their option .<-->N
In our modern and diverse society , all tastes and spectrums should be considered , with similar tax and pension benefits applied accordingly as long as there is a contractual agreement - which neither precludes marriage or cohabiting .<-->O
Janie K , England As comedian Groucho Marx said : ` Marriage is a great institution .<-->N
But who wants to live in an institution ? '<-->N
Peter Guidi , Holland Marriage is not outdated and should n't be taken so lightly .<-->O
My parents divorced when I was about 1 years old .<-->N
I have never lived in a stable environment because my mother has had one husband after another .<-->N
I can not imagine what it would be like to live with both mum and dad but I am sure it would have made my childhood much happier .<-->O
I was tormented throughout school for not having a dad , I found it upsetting when I went to a friend 's house and I saw how `` normal '' and stable it was .<-->O
In a way I owe my parents a lot because they have made me very determined that when I have children I will be married and no matter what it takes I will stay married .<-->O
I do n't ever want my child to have a part time dad like I had or a mother which they do n't respect because she does n't respect herself .<-->O
I do firmly believe the key to having healthy , happy and settled children is to give them a happy stable home life , with BOTH natural parents there to look after them .<-->O
Cara , England The concept of people making commitments to each other - perhaps for life , perhaps with the intent of raising children - will never be out-dated .<-->O
However , the concept of , I quote , `` One man and one woman , joined in union before ... ` God ' '' is clearly not the only path in this age .<-->N
The state marriage has been , and will continue to be , used as a divisive tool by those who seek to maintain the status quo of : sexual and economic repression of women , religious and racial segregation , and most of all ... the social stigmatism of those considered to be leading ` Immoral lifestyles ' by the Self-appointed Guardians of `` What is Proper '' .<-->O
State rewards for choosing one lifestyle over another are offensive in a free era , and should end immediately .<-->O
Yours , happily in love with my partner of 8 years .<-->O
Mark Wright , UK I have been married to a lovely man for over 32 years now .<-->N
We have our ups and downs as happens in any relationship but I still rather like him .<-->O
Some might say I 've been lucky - luck had nothing to do with it !!<-->O
Couples walk away from their responsibilities and commitments at the drop of a hat and without thought for the consequences , sometimes for the sake of their own selfishness .<-->N
What is happiness ?<-->N
Maybe it 's about being unselfish and putting the relationship above all and trying to work out the problems .<-->O
Marriage is not about a piece of paper , it 's about being proud of declaring your love in front of your family and friends .<-->O
It 's about making a commitment to each other for life .<-->N
That sort of commitment must never be allowed to become outdated in this age of selfishness and shallow relationships .<-->O
Ailsa , England In today 's western society the meaning of love and all that accompanies it , including marriage , has lost it 's meaning .<-->N
Selfishness and greed has replaces the traditional caring and loving environment .<-->N
This has become all too apparent by the way in which `` Family values '' , has become a favourite Election time topic for the politicians .<-->O
Kwame , UK If people wish to marry , it will always be there for them .<-->O
However , it has stood the test of ages , and since time immemorial , the statement that `` this is the person that I wish to spend the rest of my life with '' is an expression of love , and gives the bedrock on which our children can grow and learn .<-->O
The fashion of `` unfaithfulness '' comes and goes .<-->N
I feel that the current balance in UK is healthy .<-->N
Robert Chilvers , UK The decline in the rate of marriage and increase in divorce rate are just from people having more options and control over their lives .<-->O
Individuals will do what is best for them and what makes them happiest .<-->O
Any `` sacrifice '' is merely conservatism ; a happy marriage does not require sacrifice - it brings its own advantages .<-->O
Options and control over your own life are the cornerstone of being free .<-->N
Arman , USA People more often now are rightly not accepting to remain in unhappy relationships .<-->O
Paul Lethbridge , Germany Marriage was designed by God , and is the cornerstone of our society .<-->N
One of the largest problems with society today is the lack of family values .<-->O
Husbands and wives are not prepared to work out their differences , but they choose to get divorced instead .<-->N
They put their selfish interests first and do not think enough of their partner .<-->O
I believe there is a place for divorce , but too many opt for this before trying to resolve their problems .<-->O
Children have the right to be brought up in a stable environment with both a father and mother within the bonds of matrimony .<-->O
A partnership without marriage is merely a way of each partner saying `` we will live together until I find something better or I 'm tired of you '' .<-->O
Kevin Compton , UK Do n't condemn those who tried marriage yet ended in divorce .<-->N
They at least had the courage to try and the common sense to know when it would n't work .<-->O
At the time of marriage the couple involved were absolutely convinced , certainly happy and full of hope .<-->O
However in this world things change .<-->N
It is often beautiful to see a relationship evolve with the times and last but that does not diminish the beauty of a relationship that lasts as long as it can but then ends .<-->O
Paul , Hong Kong Marriage is hardly a Christian enforced issue as suggested by some since almost every religion has marriage ceremonies of one sort or another .<-->N
The problem is that these days , people are unwilling to make a commitment to someone else because we 're all to selfish to be willing to stick with someone should things go difficult -LRB- I am not referring to wife-beating in which case she 'd be better off elsewhere -RRB- .<-->O
Commitment and living the rest of one 's life putting someone else first is what puts people off and of course , we 've all got to look after number one these days .<-->N
Richard Hodges , Wales , UK Yes , marriage is utterly outdated , it is a throwback to the times of ` god fearing Christian 's , an arrangement that we have more or less inherited from previous generations .<-->O
Perhaps we need a new type of marriage contract , and get rid of this extreme 'till death do you part ' rubbish -- as it 's left over from a time when humans lived shorter , more finite lives than we do now in this digital revolution age .<-->O
Stephen Hitchcock , USA Reading these coments , I see that many emphasize comitment .<-->N
How about cooperation .<-->N
I ' v been married for 13 years , with 2 great boys .<-->N
My husband has his good points , but I work just as hard as he does .<-->O
I had worked outside the home in my career and paid $ 10,000.00 for day-care .<-->N
Believe me , there are 2 full-time jobs for mothers , who work and raise children and do laundry and shop for food and cook and clean and pay bills .<-->N
I see the same problem with so many men .<-->N
They go to work , come home , put their feet up and watch the tube and bitch about being asked to do anything around the house .<-->N
Marriage takes 2 people working together to work .<-->N
Children grow up better with 2 caring parents .<-->N
Melanie , USA No marriage is not an out-dated institution .<-->N
There is nothing wrong with the institution itself just the people in it .<-->O
Jennifer Bowdern , Australia Marriage is an arcane repressive social institution designed to curb individual freedom .<-->O
Andy , USA This is really an enigma of unimaginable proportions to me !<-->O
In the west , and especially in the US , men and women date and date and date and live together till they are finally sure they 've found the right person to marry ... In a few years , if not months , their hard found love and marriage crumbles ... WHY ?<-->O
The only thing I can say , is that love is an attitude more than something to be found such as the best bargain in town or something .<-->O
If you could love , you could feel for and love anyone . .<-->O
of course it requires that you may not win every argument or clean more than the exact number of dishes , but you might just find LOVE . .<-->O
which is not just any four-letter word !!<-->N
Navin , USA/Indian It is outdated .<-->N
You do n't need a piece of paper to commit .<-->N
We would n't sign a piece of paper for life for ANYTHING else , even a mortgage you can get with great ease .<-->O
I also do n't need to be someone 's wife or have to behave in a certain way just because I am married .<-->O
Nyky , Australia Yes marriage was only created in the last couple of hundred years .<-->N
A product of our Victorian past .<-->N
It is outmoded and has no value and was created mainly for the Christian church and adopted by the state as a legal binding contract of possession .<-->N
It should have no bearing in law and should not be recognised by the state .<-->N
Its purely a religious affair .<-->N
There 's a whole industry kept in business by this concept and a flourishing one by its downfall , lawyers fees etc. ... good riddance ... Nick Tucker , UK Marriage is the ultimate commitment to your partner .<-->O
It should never be entered into lightly .<-->N
The formal act of marriage is not only a declaration to your partner , but to your friends , family and community that this is a permanent relationship .<-->N
While , some marriages do not work out , people need to try harder before separating and think longer before marrying .<-->O
Ultimately , marriage is a lot of work and not something to be entered into because all of your friends are doing it or your family expects it .<-->N
Kelly Knowles , Canada The basis of our society is the formal recognition of relationships between couples .<-->N
It is sad that there is a growing segment of the world that can not bring itself to have responsibility and commitment to another soul .<-->O
Ruth-Dick Meyer , U.S.A. ----------------------- Is marriage an outdated institution ?<-->N
I 'd like to know before even considering popping the question .<-->O
I guess the statistics tell us that 60 % of first-time marriages end in divorce ... and that 35 % of the ones that decide to stick-it out for various reasons are unhappy , unsattisfied and some of those even begin affairs .<-->O
What do you all think ?<-->N
Is it worth it in this day and age ?<-->N
What is it that we need to change in ourselves as individuals and as a society to change the concept of marriage in this century to make it successful ?<-->O
I 'd really like to hear from the ones who have been there and the young hopefuls that can give us new and innovative ideas Best Answer : Marriage is definitely not an outdated institution .<-->O
I think the reason why 60 % of first time marriage fail is because people rush into things thinking they 've finally found the person they love without really considering what marriage means .<-->O
I believe that if you truly love the person that you 're with and you 've been thinking about asking her to marry you and you 've dated for at LEAST a year if not two , then go and ask her to marry you .<-->O
One of my friends who has just recently had a baby and got married said that the fact that they got married made no difference because they 'd been living for together for more than a year .<-->O
so , my advice to you , is if you do n't live together , do that first .<-->O
and if you do and you 've been dating for enough time so that your mom would never say , `` wow , so soon ?! ''<-->O
then go for it .<-->N
and good luck in your marriage .<-->N
I 'm sure you will be to very happy lovebirds together .<-->O
:-RRB- Marriage is not outdated , many people prefer to be unmarried .<-->N
I am one of those people but I was married for 8 years and I had a very nasty divorce .<-->O
My ex ran around , cheated and ended up giving me an STD because I believed that he loved me and would never cheat .<-->N
I was wrong , and I have no desire at this point in time to get remarried but I do n't think it is outdated .<-->O
Yes there are some of those couples that will stick it out but you ca n't stay in an unhappy marriage or relationship because it will only make you and the other person more angrier with the other or you both will resent each other and blame the other for what you might have both missed out on As a woman , I feel that marriage is a necessity for me because with regard to gender equality in relationships , our culture has not caught up to what it professes -- in other words , it does not practice what it preaches .<-->O
In my experience : A woman who gets upset and causes a scene , because she has been betrayed , humiliated , and emotionally devastated is called : ` psycho ' .<-->N
` psycho-girl ' .<-->N
Put a wedding ring on her finger , and suddenly she 's a respectable woman with a very legitimate grievance ... that is all .<-->O
Women get the shaft without marriage ... they often function in every way that a wife would , but they have not got the social and cultural status of ` wife ' , which affords some protection against being totally disrespected .<-->O
And a man to whom you are not married can wreck your life as thoroughly and quickly as if he had been your husband .<-->N
The only difference is that if you are not married to him , he can shrug you off as having been inconsequential .<-->O
Despite however long you may have acted to him like a wife-analog , if you are not married , you are expendable .<-->O
At a moment 's notice .<-->N
I 'm sure this absolutely * smacks * of a chip on my shoulder , but so be it .<-->O
Perhaps I could have made this a lot shorter simply by saying that women who are unmarried parnters of men are subject to a lot of bullying .<-->N
This is not to say that married women are not bullied as well , but our culture * actively * frowns upon it , whereas I do n't think that ` girlfriends ' get so much support .<-->O
My larger opinion upon the matter is that we could well do away with marriage , if women were really respected outside of it .<-->O
Of course , I would love to see that day .<-->N
But then that would also be the day when marriages would start to * work * .<-->N
Here 's my two cents as to why marriages these days fail .<-->N
I think people marry to soon .<-->N
They jump in before they really , I mean REALLY know the other person .<-->O
You ever hear someone say , my spouse just was n't like that before we married ?<-->O
Well they were , not enough time was taken before the marriage took place .<-->N
My advice , have a long engagement , do n't rush , and take your time !!<-->N
Good luck !<-->N
I 'm married 29 years , we had 25 happy years , four horrible years .<-->O
Believe me or not , I do n't trust marriage any more , so many unhappy marriages from my friends and relatives , divorces , cheating , lying , fighting , all bad examples to the children , so sorry for the kids who live together as enemy to each other but because of that piece of document .<-->O
Well I will put it this way .<-->N
Most people today would like for it to be oudated but it should not be so .<-->O
Marriage is very important and should not be entered into lightly !<-->O
People should men their vows and honor them and abide by them all the days of their lives till death do they part .<-->O
I do feel it is very much worth it today !<-->O
I am very happily married and devoted and very much in love with my husband and we have been married almost 7 years and i love it !!!! As individuals we need to change ourselves and our views about marrige and what it really means .<-->O
We need to be selfless and not selfish we need to love each other where they are at and not try to change them into what we want them to be ... The only one we have power to change at all is ourselves to be the better spouse that we need to be !<-->O
We need to be committed , honest , loyal and devoted to each other and to treat each other the way we want to be treated .<-->O
A great website it http://www.marriagetoday.org I hope this answers your question .<-->O
I love this question it is a great one !<-->O
Thanks so much for asking it !<-->N
Marriage is what you make of it !<-->N
Love is a choice :-RRB- If people would concentrate and work on ther marriages and relationships like they do at work or being better parents what a better world and marriages we would have today !<-->O
Marriage will never be outdated nor will love and commitment .<-->O
What is needed is more counseling and training at how to have effective marriages ... communication and conflict resolution skills .<-->N
It 's true that marriage has lost it 's sanction , it seems more like `` till I do n't feel like it anymore '' than `` till death do us part '' .<-->O
So many people do n't realize the effort it takes to make a marriage work and when the times get rough they bail .<-->N
I still believe that marriage should be once and forever .<-->O
I 'm 25 was married at 18 divorced at 22 I 'm once again about to take that step i looked at it deeper this time this guy had to have more sense , we had to date longer then a year he had to treat me with respect , and i had alot of my own changes to deal with and we both had to acknowledge we were not one in the same we had differences and had to be able to accept them in to our lives so far so good Yes ------------------------------------ ## The principle of marriage has always been to provide a stable home life for the rearing of children .<-->O
Psychologically scientific studies have found that co-habitation does not lend itself to as much psychological stability for a child .<-->N
Regardless of the level of commitment between a couple , society still recognises marriage as an institution where most stability is gained .<-->O
This is not to discredit single parent families or divorced parents , but to acknowledge the institute of marriage as the ideal outcome of a loving relationship and desire for a family .<-->O
## Marriage is about providing stable home life for the rearing of children .<-->N
## Family equals identity .<-->N
A solid family gives status for children who then has no need to turn to gangs , drugs , or other problem causing behaviors , to feel accepted .<-->O
Within a traditional family the identity of a child is able to develop .<-->N
Identity is essential for vision , growth , and unity .<-->N
Without correct identity , nations and communities can not progress or develop unity because there are so many different identities and no common cause .<-->O
Marriage is not outdated because we still see unity today and must see it in the future .<-->O
Yes Marriage statistics themselves show that 1 out of 3 marriages are re-marriages .<-->N
So whilst the divorce statistics may be at 40 % , this does not show a lack of faith in marriage as an institution , merely that divorce is easier and more acceptable , or couples are entering into marriage more freely than before .<-->O
Just because some marriages may fail does not mean that we should give up on an ideal .<-->O
We are frequently disillusioned by the criminal justice system when it fails , but this does not mean we do not aspire to the principles it upholds in society .<-->O
The same can be said for marriage .<-->N
Yes Marriage is still important in society as a rational view of what a loving committed relationship actually is : if love is so transient in society it is important to have a foundation to hold couples together to realise that friendship , support , trust and commitment are more important .<-->O
We can not encourage couples to live a more relaxed relationship when as parents they are responsible for a child s welfare .<-->O
Yes Legally , marriage represents a more solid and protected base for both parties .<-->N
In addition to protecting against inheritance disputes , loss of belongings etc. if the couple break up , it also may provide a stopcheck for separated couples who may decide to work harder at the relationship , being bound together by a legal contract as well as an emotional one .<-->O
Legally , governments spend millions on social welfare programs .<-->N
Every societal problem is trying to be fixed by one or more of these social programs that are so very much less effective than the role the traditional family .<-->O
A deeper look at each social program would show that they are trying to make up where the traditional family has left off .<-->O
Marriage is not outdated because we see the government funding programs that do not work as well as the family .<-->N
Yes Marriage as a religious institution still retains its validity in a country whose main state religion is Christianity .<-->N
For atheists , marriage need not represent religious bonding , but may still be a socially recognised approval and public avowal of love and commitment No The primary focus of marriage is religious in nature to many people .<-->O
In the current declining popularity of religion in Britain , such an institution is simply not representative of the majority beliefs .<-->O
British society is too diverse now to have a moral consensus that goes beyond small groups No The law incorporates enough protection for couples with common law marriages and various jurisdictions over inheritance and ownership .<-->O
Co-habitation is far more practical , and avoids lengthy , painful , and expensive legal proceedings in the event of a relationship breakdown .<-->O
The only thing that marriage gains is a socially recognised sense of emotional stability , and divorce rates are indicative of the fact that if a relationship is set to fail , the institution of marriage itself will not save it .<-->O
No It is often the restrictions of society s old-fashioned view of marriage that can cause it s very problems .<-->O
Relationship counsellors discovered that boredom , and taking your partner for granted were the most common manifestation of marital disputes , and often the constraints of marriage as opposed to co-habitation may cause either partner to feel trapped , thus compounding their problems .<-->O
No It is unreasonable to expect couples to stay together for a lifetime in this day and age .<-->N
There is more social pressure than ever before to be happy - and this outweighs the necessity to make a marriage work regardless .<-->O
Fidelity is not determined by a marriage certificate and with an ever increasing life expectancy , and the freedom to pursue one s goals more liberal , it is naive to believe that there is no possibility of couples either changing or making an original `` mistake '' in choosing each other .<-->O
Society has long accepted that life partners need not be for life anymore .<-->O
If people want to be together , surely they will .<-->O
If a couple does n't want to be together , why should their pain be drawn out unnecessarily by the formal bond of matrimony ?<-->O
No It is fallacious to presume that marriage as an institution is what provides a stable home environment for a child .<-->O
What is most important is the relationship between the two parents and their attitudes and relationships individually and together with the child .<-->O
This is completely uncorrelated with marriage .<-->N
What s more a stable co-habitation situation is far better for a child than an unhappy marriage .<-->O
The heartache , pain , stress and psychological disturbance of a child when their parents break up is not due to the breakdown of marriage but the breakdown of a relationship .<-->O

Marriages are an outdated institution Marriages are so out of fashion because nobody seems to be doing it not even the celebrity 's who we all admire so much and look in them as a role models .<-->O
When they get a new hair do we go to the hairdresser and try to get our hair done as near as possible to theirs we just do it to be in fashion and to be cool to try and get more popular .<-->O
So if marriages are n't the in thing at the time we do n't give marriage a second thought it 's only for old fashioned people .<-->N
People do n't want commitment any more being tied to the same person for the rest of your life is too big a step .<-->O

Middle Underage sex is happening these days and the age for sex seems to be getting lower and lower as time goes on .<-->N
This has brought about single teenage mums who are not prepared for motherhood and fathers that do n't want to be any part of their child 's life .<-->N
Single parented mothers find it harder to have new relationships and makes it harder for them to trust another man after the last one deserting her .<-->N
This makes marriage seem so far away maybe not existent , because men do n't like to be left bringing up another man 's children .<-->O
People are spending their cash in other ways instead of saving it for their dream wedding day or to build a future for your future wife or husband .<-->N
People would much rather spend their money on cars , clothes , and holidays anything but saving .<-->O
Some people seem very happy not getting married living the high life having nobody else to spend their cash on but themselves being able to flirt with any man or woman than takes their eye without worrying what your partner will think .<-->O
They can come and go as they please .<-->N

Conclusion If you are married men mostly pay the bills and takes responsibility for the financial side of things so that takes alot of stress and bother of the women and men like working with figures so its best all round .<-->O
Men also do the DIY and gardening chores .<-->N
Women do most of the cooking and cleaning so and have to give birth to his children , which is the hardest job so it 's nearly fair .<-->O
Is it worth getting married ?<-->N
That is the question we all want to no my honest opinion is that I do n't think it is because it causes a lot of unnecessary stress that you could do without .<-->O
Alot a lot of people would disagree with me because they want to settle down get married have children and have an easy life .<-->O
I no from experience of looking after my little brother the best thing is to stay unmarried not to have children because at the end of the day they are nice to look at but you be glad to hand them back at the end of it all ------------------------- Is it possible that the problem is choosing the wrong person to marry ?<-->O
Or choosing the right person , and not treating your marriage and your spouse with the honor and esteem they deserve ?<-->O
Or that not everyone has to get married , no matter how much your mom wants grandchildren , or how annoying it is that your friends with kids no longer call you to hang out?It s better to be happy alone then unhappy with someone .<-->O
If you find someone you can t live without , get married using good judgement , then always treat each other kindly and with respect , chances are very good you will have a happy , lifelong marriage .<-->O
Almost 50 % of first marriages today end in divorce because people marry to soon , choose poorly , or get married and then put their marriage and partner somewhere down the line on their list of priorities .<-->O
Did you know that about 2/3 of divorce are because people get married before turning 21 , and weren t mature enough to make good choices ?<-->O
If you wait until you are over 21 to marry for the first time , your chance of having a lifelong marriage is 75 % .<-->N
That is pretty darned good .<-->N
Almost 70 % of second marriages end in divorce , so if you don t get it right the first time , your chances of doing better with someone else -LRB- especially once children are involved -RRB- becomes more difficult , and if you marry a third time the divorce rate indicates you are 75 % likely find yourself single again .<-->O
It s easy to see why people think the institution of marriage today is outdated with these statistics , until you look at the ages of those getting hitched , the reasons they choose to get married , and the choices they make after marriage .<-->O
Marriage is a blessing for people who want to be married , are mature enough and ready to be married , and meet the right person .<-->O
If you don t fit that description and get married anyway , chances are you ll be a casualty .<-->O
I don t feel marriage is an outdated institution if so many people still want to be married , get married -LRB- multiple times -RRB- , and homosexual couples are fighting to get in on the act .<-->O
Gladiator fighting is outdated .<-->N
Electrocuting psychiatric patients is outdated .<-->N
It seems to be thriving in the midst of all the hate toward it as an institution .<-->N

Has the United Nations Failed ?<-->N
Established in 1945 and now in its sixty fifth year , the United Nations is perceived to be aworld authority which has agencies to deal with any crisis which may arise .<-->N
Frompeacekeeping to humanitarian efforts , it is perceived that if any country has difficulties , itturns to the United Nations for help .<-->N
But how successful has the United Nations been inshowing its commitment as a global institution ready to help any country in need ?<-->O
Opinion onthe effectiveness of the United Nations is divided and is also dependent on which decade isexamined .<-->O
It could be considered the United Nations was more successful in its early years .<-->N
Another view is that America does not consider itself as under the control of the UnitedNations , more an equal partner and as such not perhaps subjected to the same rules asother countries .<-->O
Conversely , it could be suggested the United Nations is more successful inhumanitarian aid rather than as a peacekeeping force .<-->O
To aid discussion on the successesand failures of the United Nations , case studies will be used from a range of decadesassessing ; peacekeeping , peace-enforcement , reactions to countries in crisis , prevention of war and the global response to a crisis .<-->O
The United Nations could be regarded as successfulas its continuing existence means its authority is recognised , but large scale failures havemeant its reputation as a global power has been tainted.From its conception in the 1940s , the United Nations aim was to keep peace amongnations throughout the world .<-->O
The historiography of the United Nations shows its reputationfor successes was being questioned from its early days .<-->N
Alfred J. Hotz , American politicalscientist , in 1961 suggested , ' ... it has become apparent that the effectiveness of the UnitedNations in settling disputes is directly related to the remoteness of the dispute from the bi-polar conflict .<-->O
As this was the height of the Cold War between Soviet Russia and America , it is not surprising Holtz has this prospective .<-->N
Stopping the spread of communism was at theforefront of thought in America .<-->N
Hotz also discusses how the use of the veto by the fivepermanent members of the Security Council was positive .<-->N
He concluded the veto wouldprevent the United Nations , ' ... employment of a nation 's armed forces without consent . '<-->O
Thiswas a condition America had demanded in the beginnings of the United Nations , to supressany communist uprising .<-->N
Hotz also comments on how the United Nations was making greatstrides in global education , but this was from a western prospective and not as comparableas it could be with eastern ideals .<-->N
Although Hotz was trying to be balanced in his argument , this could have been misread by American agencies as a pro-communist view .<-->O
However , Hotz comment , a ninety-nine - member General Assembly was too vast to enable , serious debate and compromises ... ' .<-->O
This is interesting as the member states currently total onehundred and ninety three countries .<-->N
Hotz , while conscious of the Cold War limitations , itcould be argued still saw the United Nations as having a prevalent and successful role inglobal affairs.In 1962 another political scientist , Harlan Cleveland , considered the future role of theUnited Nations .<-->O
Cleveland was working as Assistant Secretary of State for InternationalOrganizational Affairs , and was ideally placed to comment on the work of the United Nations.Cleveland remarked on disarmament talks between states through the United Nations , ' emphasis on building international peace - keeping machinery while dismantling nationalwar-making capacity ' .<-->O
Like Hotz , Cleveland was writing at the height of the Cold War andonly a few months before the Cuban Missile Crisis .<-->N
Cleveland thought that the UnitedNations was to play a role in the disarmament talks between the super powers .<-->N
Clevelandalso considered the United Nations would have a new role of developing and supervising anInternational Outer Space Program .<-->N
This could have been inspired by the American President John F. Kennedy s promise to American people to have a man on the moon by theend of the decade .<-->O
Cleveland sums up the importance of the American leadership in theUnited Nations by stating , ' ... that is both the prize and price of our power ' .<-->O
It could besuggested that Cleveland saw the United Nations could only exist with strong Americanleadership.By 1973 , the hope and aspirations of the United Nations was beginning to dissipate.Hollis W. Barber , political scientist , wrote in 1973 , ' ... in recent years it seems that aparticularly large proportion of its political endeavours have led to disillusion not only of American voters , but of the United States government itself .<-->O
This perspective could be aresult of the on-going war in Vietnam , of which the United Nations had no part .<-->O
Barber also comments , Presidents have often professed their belief that the United Nations was a main pillar of United States foreign policy , but such a belief is not necessarily immutable ' .<-->O
Thiswould suggest Barber believed that the United Nations could not exist without America.In the 1980s , the end of the Cold War meant the focus for the United Nations was notrestricted by the Soviet sphere .<-->N
Roger A. Coate and Donald J. Puchala from Department of Government and International Studies , University of South Carolina , noted in the late 1980sthe political changes in global policy had meant the United Nations had been ` reinvigorated ` as a peace keeping force , but had not been as successful in peace building .<-->O
As the coldwar was ending , the permanent members of the Security Council found a consensus whichmeant global policy could be enacted more readily .<-->O
Health issues like combating the worldepidemic of AIDS became a huge priority for the World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- .<-->N
With itsGlobal Program on Aids -LRB- GPA -RRB- had won universal approval from the United Nationsmembers .<-->N
Human rights also became a priority for the United Nations at this time .<-->N
Although the United Nations was able to reach more countries than during the coldwar , the effectiveness of peace building was difficult .<-->O
As Coate and Puchala have stated , ' ... there is too much diversity in the world to allow for concerted effective global action ' 13 .<-->O
The1980s was a period of global political change which enabled the United Nations to beperceived to be more effective in roles such as peacekeeping .<-->N
It also enabled the UnitedNations to focus on humanitarian efforts , with a positive commitment to world peace.By 1995 the United Nations reliability was being questioned after its failure in some of its missions in Somalia and Rwanda .<-->O
The Indian political scientist Rajni Kothari describedthe current position of the United Nations in 1995 as , ' ... stand -LSB- ing -RSB- on a paradoxicalthreshold .<-->N
Its real power is on the decline and its credibility in a state of utter ambivalence ... ' 14 .<-->O
He continues that the dominant states did not need to rely on the United Nations for peacekeeping , as the United Nations was shredding its real responsibilities 15 .<-->O
ToKothari the United Nations had begun to outsource peacekeeping to stronger states like America .<-->N
Kothari also commented the work of the United Nations in education and welfare inpoorer states , was being undertaken by charities under the ` umbrella ' of the UnitedNations 16 .<-->N
Not totally dismissive of the United Nations as an institution , Kothari suggests thefuture role should be one that creates , ' ... a structure through which ` peace ' becomes a condition of ` justice ' 17 .<-->O
At this Kothari sees the United Nations as a body to uphold humanrights through democratic means.and the right to market Iraqi oil ' 18 .<-->O
Albright was keen to illustrate the United Nations was animportant body in which sanctioned action was sort by America .<-->N
Albright continues , ` Anddespite their unilateralist tendencies , Bush administration officials will welcome councilsupport when battling terrorists and rogue states in the future ' 19 .<-->O
America was still seekingpatronage for the United Nations on its action against what it perceived to be as terroriststates .<-->N
Albright continues , ' ... it remains the most widely accepted source of internationallegitimacy ... ' 20 .<-->N
For any action taken by America or its allies the United Nations authorisationwould be wanted .<-->N
Although , only a small sample of historiography , it could be suggested that thesecommentators were supportive of a global authority .<-->N
Failures in missions and its lack of effectiveness during the Cold War impacted on how the United Nations was seen as anauthority .<-->N
But in the twenty first century the United Nations legitimacy for foreign interventionis still sort after by powerful states like America.When assessing the criteria for success or failure of the United Nations it could besuggested four areas could be considered ; peacekeeping , peace-enforcement , reactions tocountries in crisis , prevention of war and the global response to a crisis as areas to examine.By using the performance of the United Nations in these issues from across the decades , itis possible to draw conclusions from these issues on the successes and failures of theUnited Nations.Firstly , Lebovic states , ` In traditional peacekeeping , UN personnel functioned as aneutral , light armed force within a clear and accepted buffer zone ' 21 .<-->O
By using the SuezCrisis the first example of the United Nations undertaking a peacekeeping mission , thesuccess of the mission can be assess by the fulfilment of the mandate given by the United Nations .<-->N
Secondly , a peace-enforcement mandate was given to United Nations forces in TheCongo in 1960 .<-->N
The Congo mission did fulfil its mandate , but the changing of the mandateduring the mission and the impartiality of the United Nations meant the success of themission was compromised .<-->N
Thirdly , the slow reaction by the United Nations to the crisis inRwanda in 1994 was arguably one of the biggest disasters for the United Nations .<-->O
The slowdeployment of troops meant genocide took place and the reputation of the United Nations asa humanitarian force was damaged .<-->N
Fourthly , the United Nations was perceived to be a bodywhich would authorise intervention for the protection of people .<-->N
In the case of the Gulf War in2003 , the United Nations had issued warnings to Iraq , but it was American interventionwhich forced the issue to invasion status .<-->N
The legitimacy of the war was called into questionas a specific mandate for this action was not made by the United Nations .<-->O
Finally , theresponse to a global crisis can be assessed through the United Nations work in humanitarianissues .<-->N
Focusing on the United Nations role in combating the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS , the response may have been initially slow , but an agency within the United Nations ishelping to pool resources and educate poorer counties , which may have slowed downinfection rates .<-->N
These assessment criteria not only help to build a picture of the missionsundertaken by the United Nations , but can also help to evaluate results.The first mission by the United Nations as a peace keeping force was in Suez and iswidely considered a success and the birth of peacekeeping missions .<-->O
In October 1956British , French and Israeli forces attacked Egypt .<-->N
Although Israel was attacking Egypt due to Egypt s invasion of Gaza , British and French forces were attacking for economic reasons .<-->N
President Nasser of Egypt had nationalised the French and British owned Suez Cannel , stopping British and French ships passing through this vital trade route .<-->N
A few days into theconflict an emergency session of the United Nations was called .<-->N
France and Britain vetoedany action to restrict their regaining control of the Suez Canal and a consensus could not bereached .<-->O
The crisis was then referred to the General assembly who called for an immediateceasefire and withdrawal of troops .<-->N
This prompted the establishment of United Nations Emergency Force -LRB- UNEF1 -RRB- .<-->F
Their mandate was to supervise a ceasefire by all sides and thewithdrawal of foreign troops from the area .<-->F
UNEF1 set up a buffer zone between all sidesand supervised the ceasefire until the mandate had been fulfilled .<-->F
The UNEF1 consisting of troops from United Nations countries including ; Canada , Colombia , Denmark , Indonesia , andYugoslavia , who all contributed to the mission which lasted eleven years 22 .<-->N
For the UnitedNations this was considered a successful mission , as it fulfilled the mandate which had beenset by the United Nations.The intervention of the United Nations was no surprise to the British ; Geoffrey Waner suggests British Foreign Secretary John Selwyn Lloyd believed even though Britain andFrance would veto the Security Council actions , the general assembly would take action 23 .<-->O
Scott Lucas disagrees with Warner , ` Whitehall and the Elys e aimed at nothing less than aUN sanctioning of military action ' 24 .<-->N
Kyle agrees with Scott Lucas , ' ... the two Europeanpowers went to the United Nations in search of political window dressing for military action ' 25 .<-->N
It could be consider that the British and French believed they had the power within theUnited Nations to push for agreed action against Egypt .<-->O
This was not the case and theUnited Nations was able to keep neutrality on the issue .<-->N
A consequence of the Suez Crisis was , the composition of the United Nations itself changed .<-->N
As it developed , the balance of power at the world organization favoured Asia , Africa , and Latin America ' 26 .<-->N
This shift of power was interesting , as America had triedto remain at a distance in this conflict .<-->O
This may have been due to America not wanting ColdWar issues , like Vietnam , being discussed by the United Nations 27 .<-->N
It could be suggested theSuez Crisis was damaging for Britain on a global stage .<-->N
The United Nations on the other hand was perceived as a successful global body .<-->N
It had not only successfully negotiatedpeace , but the UNEF1 had created a buffer zone for this to be maintained .<-->N
As the peacemission this was a United Nations success in fulfilling its mandate.The Congo in 1960 was a different situation and left the United Nations reputationand finances in a difficult state .<-->N
Belgium had given the Congo its independence , but in amanner with meant the civilian government was ill prepared .<-->O
The army then mutiny from thecivilian parliament .<-->N
At the same time Tshombe , leader of the richest part of Congo , Katanga , announced it would split from the rest of the Congo .<-->N
As the Congo descended into chaosPrime Minister Lumumba asked the United Nations for help .<-->N
The help did not appear quicklyenough so Lumumba asked the Soviets directly for help .<-->O
Lumumba was subsequently killedand Leader Cyrille Adoula asked the United Nations for help to defeat Tshombe .<-->N
The UnitedNations reacted by sending 5,000 troops on the mission called Op ration des Nations Uniesau Congo -LRB- ONUC -RRB- .<-->N
The mandate stated ONUC was to ; restore law and order , stop other steps from becoming involved , restore political stability and help rebuild the economy 28 .<-->O
InFebruary 1961 the mandate was increased to include power to Secretary General DagHammerskj ld prevention of the country descending in to civil war , which could include theuse of force to prevent fighting .<-->O
In September Hammerskj ld had travelled to Rhodesia -LRB- Zimbabwe -RRB- to have talks with Tshome , but Hammerskj ld was killed in a plane crash .<-->N
Thenew Secretary-General U Thant continued to bring peace to the region .<-->N
By November another resolution was passed giving the power to take any steps necessary to prevent war.This mission although did fulfil the mandates set by the Security Council , but is it considereda failure by Historians such as Ebere Nwaubani , as he perceives too much power was givento Hammerskj ld.Nwaubani states , ' ... UN officials s aw no contradiction between their positions in aninternational , neutral , mediatory organization and their pro-western , as opposed to pro-Soviet , bent ' 29 .<-->O
ONUC was seen as failure as Hammerskj ld not only exceeded his power asSecretary-General , but also made it clear he favoured one side over the other .<-->O
MarrackGoulding Under-Secretary-General of United Nations from 1986-1997 does not see theoperation in the Congo as a failure , but in succeeding in its objectives .<-->N
It was the firstoperation to use a civilian element , it was the first time the United Nations had beendeployed in a collapsing state and also the first time the force had to change frompeacekeeping to a peace-enforcement 30 .<-->N
The United Nations helped to establish aCongolese parliament and advised on constitution and reconciliation matters .<-->N
United Nationstroops gave military assistance in suppressing the opposition 31 .<-->N
America supported actionsin the Congo by the United Nations as it did not want any Soviet intervention in any parts of Africa .<-->N
It could be suggested the ONUC mission was successful in parts as it completed themandate set by the United Nations .<-->N
Conversely , the United Nations failed as the neutrality inconflict was compromised due to the supporting of one side over another.Rwanda is arguably the biggest failure of the twentieth century for the United Nationson not only a humanitarian , but peacekeeping mission .<-->N
In 1993 Hutu President Juv nalHabyarimana signed a power sharing agreement with Tutsis people in Rwanda , the UN sentCanadian General Romeo Dallaire to monitor the peace agreement .<-->O
In January 1994Dallaire told the United Nations of a possible extermination plan by the Hutu people of theTutsi .<-->N
He also advised of demonstrations to whip up support of genocide and the Rwandangovernment was training people for genocide .<-->O
After President Habyarimana was killed after his plane was shot down in April 1994 , the Hutu began to control the country and media.Propaganda against Tutsis people was openly aired on radio .<-->O
A week after the plane wentdown the genocide against the Tutsis began .<-->N
Local communities organise own genocide , some done with guns and grenades , but mainly machete .<-->N
Dallaire advised the UnitedNations genocide was occurring but was not believed .<-->N
Rwandan government mounted acampaign to show Dallaire was lying and to prove no genocide was happening .<-->O
The worldmedia found it difficult to get to Rwanda because of its central place in Africa , so genocidereports could not be confirmed or denied .<-->O
From April to July 1994 , 800,000 were peoplekilled .<-->N
Some Tutsis escape over the border and joined the Patriotic Front after fleeing fromgenocide .<-->F
May 17 1994 the United Nations committed 5,000 troops from the French .<-->N
June22 French troops were deployed , but they were slow in their deployment and after most of the killing had occurred .<-->N
In 2008 Rwandan government accused French of knowing aboutthe genocide.The International community were slow to react .<-->O
This could have been becauseRwanda had no natural assets ; therefore there was no American involvement .<-->O
Unfortunately , other global problems which consumed the United Nations in Yugoslavia and Somalia , meant Rwanda , did not get the full attention it deserved .<-->O
United Nations Internationalcriminal court , helped to get some leaders arrested .<-->N
In 1994 the Under-Secretary-General of United Nations Peacekeeping Operations was Kofi Annan , who went on to become theseventh Secretary-General of the United Nations , 1997-2006 .<-->N
Bariagaber suggests Annanhad , ' ... a sense of organisational and personal guilt at not helping Rwanda during its time of need 32 .<-->O
It could be suggested the mistakes by the United Nations were a failure of Annan toreact to information from Dellaire .<-->O
Hintjens states one of the reasons the in internationalresponse to Rwanda was slow was the , ' ... international indifference and ignorance about therealities of Rwanda 's situation ' 33 .<-->O
The international community did not respond to Rwandaquickly enough to prevent atrocities .<-->N
` None of the many countries that made their forcesnormally available to the UN for peace operations was willing to commit forces to stop thecarnage in Rwanda ' 34 .<-->N
In November 1994 the United Nations Security Council officiallyrecognised Rwanda 's genocide , yet the American government told their employees not usethe term 35 .<-->N
Rwanda was arguably one of the largest failures of the United Nations in thetwentieth century .<-->N
Even though the United Nations had personnel in Rwanda , its lack of ability to listen and react to the situation described meant a catastrophic loss of life.By the beginning of the twenty first century humanitarian and prevention of loss of lifewas top of the agenda in the United Nations .<-->O
For America , a terrorist attack on 11September 2001 on main land America meant terrorism was a priority for them .<-->N
Since thefirst Gulf war in 1990s , Iraq had been watched by America and the United Nations .<-->N
TheUnited Nations was concerned with Iraq having weapons capable of large scaleindiscriminate killing .<-->O
The Americans were concerned terrorist groups , such as Al Qaeda , were operating in and around Iraq .<-->N
The action of going to war in Iraq was American led , butwas this war a legitimate action sanctioned by a United Nations resolution?By 2002 , Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , had begun to make weapons inspections byUnited Nations inspectors difficult and was being uncooperative .<-->O
In a speech to the UnitedNations on 12 September 2002 , American President George W. Bush began to make thecase for aggressive actions against Iraq for non - compliance of allowing weapons inspectors into the region . '<-->N
we find all these dangers , in their most lethal and aggressive forms , exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations was born to confront ' 36 .<-->O
Thisstatement implied the regime in Iraq needed the resolve of the United Nations to preventaggressive actions in the surrounding region .<-->N
Bush also states Hussein was violating thehuman rights of his people and expanding his biological and nuclear weapon capabilities , which were against previous United Nations resolution 686 37 and 687 38 brought in after thefirst Gulf war in 1991 .<-->O
Bush continues by stating what measures the United Nations havealready tried and failed .<-->N
It is at This point Bush 's rhetoric becomes personal to the UnitedNations , ` Are Security Council resolutions to be honoured and enforced , or cast asidewithout consequence ?<-->N
Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding , or will it beirrelevant ? '<-->N
Bush then instead of insisting the United Nations be more forceful I its actions , Bush states , ` My nation will work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our commonchallenge ' 39 .<-->N
This implied that America has more important role to play in global governancethan the United Nations alone.On 8 November 2002 , resolution 1441 was passed by the United Nations SecurityCouncil .<-->N
The resolution stated that the United Nations would give Saddam Husain and theIraqi government one more chance to comply with weapons inspectors to be allowed intoIraq .<-->N
The paragraphs to focus in in this short resolution are paragraph two which gives Iraq a ` final opportunity ' to comply .<-->N
Paragraph four states failure to do so would be breach of Iraq ` sresponsibilities .<-->O
Finally paragraph thirteen which states if these obligations are not met ' -LSB- Iraq -RSB- will face serious consequences as a result ' 40 .<-->O
It could be considered that these paragraphswithin Resolution 1441 that led to the invasion of Iraq.On 5 February 2003 American Secretary of State , Colin Powell , addressed theUnited Nations Security council with evidence of ` Iraq 's failure to disarm . '<-->O
His speech was fullof the same rhetoric that Bush 's had some six months earlier .<-->N
Using a combination of satellite images and intercepted phone calls , later exposed as fake , Powell stated the casefor war .<-->O
Powell stated to the United Nations , ` This body places itself in danger of irrelevanceif it allows Iraq to continue to defy its will without responding effectively and immediately ' 41 .<-->O
This shows America still considered the United Nations to be on the peripherals of globalpeacekeeping , and that America could invade Iraq with or without United Nations consent.War was still not unavoidable at this time according to Mearsheimer and Walt.Writing at the time they commented that discouraging Saddam Husain had previouslyworked 42 . '<-->O
Americans should understand that a compelling strategic rationale is absent .<-->O
This war would be one the Bush administration chose to fight but did not have to fight ' 43 .<-->O
Dunne agreed and stated at the time , ' t he plaudits miss the obvious point that the Bushadministration and likeminded people see the UN as a -LRB- barely -RRB- optional extra in pursuit of American interests ' 44 .<-->O
Dunne continued that it was obvious Bush would continue the road towar with or without a sound resolution from the United Nations 45 .<-->O
It could be concluded thatfrom these points America was going to war in Iraq by choice and that the United Nationshad become irrelevant in keeping the peace.The American government did not seek a new resolution from the United Nations toinvade Iraq .<-->O
They felt the warnings within Resolution 1441 gave enough of a mandate tomount an invasion .<-->N
The coalition forces of British and Australian led by American troops tookplace on 19 March 2003 .<-->N
By May the conflict and defeat of Saddam Husain 's governmentalforces was complete .<-->O
It was at this point it was clear that the American 's had not consideredthe aftermath of the war .<-->O
The legality of the war was also called into question by the thenSecretary-General of United Nations Kofi Annan .<-->N
He made a statement on 7 April 2003commenting on how the United Nations would participate on a humanitarian level , ` Butabove all the UN involvement does bring legitimacy which is necessary , necessary for thecountry , for the region and f or the peoples around the world , ' 46 .<-->O
This suggests that beforethis the war had not been ratified by the United Nations , but by it becoming involved after theinvasion the war would retrospectively become sanctioned by the United Nations.It could be considered the Iraq war was not a United Nations operation , but an American led invasion of a hostile country .<-->O
America did not seek a specific resolution whichratified the invasion .<-->N
The evidence it had presented to gain agreement by the United Nationsfor military action was later found to be fake .<-->O
This would support the argument that Americaconsiders its self as a partner of the United Nations and not under the control of the UnitedNations .<-->O
It could be suggested that the United Nations failed to prevent the Iraq war.When considering the United Nations missions in Suez , the Congo , Rwanda and Iraqthe successes are mixed .<-->N
The early missions in Suez and the Congo are arguably moresuccessful .<-->N
This could be due to clear and concise mandates that were followed by UNEF1and ONUC .<-->N
Contrastingly , the slow reactions in 1994 to the Rwandan genocide meant theUnited Nations failed to protect vulnerable people .<-->O
The actions of America , althoughintended to be perceived as part of a United Nations mandate , it could be considered theBush administration needed to be seen by the American public as combating terrorism .<-->N
TheUnited Nations did not fail in all of its peacekeeping missions , but failed in its protection of civilians.One area in which the United Nations responded effectively to world problems withpositivity and as a global power is in health and education .<-->O
The United Nations AIDSProgramme -LRB- UNAIDS -RRB- is an example of how pulling together agencies within the UnitedNations can show an effective global response .<-->N
UNAIDS was set up in 1995 to give a worldresponse to the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS .<-->N
Although HIV/AIDS had reached epidemicproportions in Africa , infection rates in America and in Europe were also increasing .<-->N
By 1985the infection had reached China which meant AIDS was now present in all regions of theworld .<-->F
Individual governments of countries were responding with advertising campaigns andadvice .<-->N
Poorer countries in Africa and Asia cases were increasing as advice was difficult toreach distant communities .<-->O
In 1995 UNAIDS was established to give a global response.UNAIDS objectives are to ` unite ' the efforts of United Nations , governments and privatesectors , give a voice and ` dignity ' to people who live with AIDS , ` mobilizing ' technical andscientific research , making sure the latest information is available and ` supporting ' allcountries in their response to AIDS 47 .<-->O
Susan Timberlake describes UNAIDS as , ' ... special joint programme , bringing together UN organizations with complementary mandates andexpertise , was thought to be warranted by the epidemic 's urgency ... ' 48 .<-->O
It was clear a globalresponse was needed by the United Nations against HIV/AIDS .<-->N
In late 1970s and early1980s 4 million adults and children had become newly infected with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa had become infected with HIV compared with 44,000 in North America 49 .<-->N
Themillennium goal set in 2000 by UNAIDS was by 2015 to halt and begin to reverse the spreadof AIDS 50 .<-->N
In 2000 UNAIDS was being prised by for its innovative work on training people , towork on the medical ethics of explaining to developing countries the help and educationneeded to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS 51 .<-->N
By the fifteenth biennial conference held inBangkok in 2004 the global response to HIV/AIDS was not as consolidated as UNAIDS hasenvisaged .<-->N
Although UNAIDS was set up as a global response to crisis Jon Cohencomments , the Bush administration limited the amount of scientists who attended theHIV/AIDS conference in 2004 , which was mentioned several times during the weeklongconference 52 .<-->N
-LRB- P. 470 -RRB- The Bush administration had launched its own program , President ` sEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief -LRB- PEPFAR -RRB- , which planned to distribute $ 15 billion to fifteencountries over five years .<-->N
This plan was criticized for not only the lack of countries it would help , but the amount was fifteen times more than America s contribution to the Global Fund .<-->O
Some also questioned the Bush ideology was driving this policy , rather than genuine desireto help people 53 .<-->O
At the conference Jim Yong Kim , head of HIV/AIDS department at WHO stated , ` Wehave failed miserably to do enough in the precious time that has passed since Barcelona ' 54 .<-->O
Kim felt in the two years previous to this conference little had been done at achieve themillennium goal .<-->O
In a report at this conference it was estimated only eight per cent peoplewho needed anti-HIV drugs were receiving them in developing countries 55 .<-->N
At the end of theconference Peter Piot , executive director of UNAIDS , suggested that the efforts to combatHIV/AIDS would be better coordinated as one instead of fragmented help from differentcountries 56 .<-->O
Roger England in 2008 commented about UNAIDS , ' ... HIV has been treated like aneconomic sector rather than a disease ' 57 .<-->O
He continued that UNAIDS had created a problemin that developing countries were relying on the aid from UNAIDS to pay for HIV/AIDS drugsand care .<-->N
No system was being put into place to make these countries create their ownstructure to combat the HIV/AIDS problem .<-->N
He also stated pneumonia and diabetes werebigger killers , so was asking why was there not a United Nations agency to deal with thoseproblems ?<-->N
This harsh reality saw England comment the global response to HIV/AIDS wasdisproportionate to the amount of people suffering with the disease.By 2000 , 3.8 million people in Sub-Sahara region had been newly infected comparedwith 45,000 people in North America 59 .<-->O
Although the statistics on HIV/AIDS infection ratesare estimates in 2010 five per cent of the Sub-Saharan population of 15-49 year olds hadHIV/AIDS 60 .<-->N
These figures suggest UNAIDS has not meet its millennium target of halting andreducing new cases .<-->N
However , 2.7 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2010 , which a small figure than 3.2 million in 2001 61 .<-->N
But it could be suggested without anyresponse form UNAIDS , the Sub-Saharan population percentage with HIV/AIDS may havebeen in double figures .<-->N
UNAIDS is a positive agency from the United Nations which worksfor the humanitarian effort of the people .<-->N
With this in mind it could be suggest UNAIDS is asuccess of the United Nations.In conclusion , the United Nations has not failed as it is still in existence .<-->O
Thepeacekeeping reputation of the United Nations may have been damaged by Rwanda andIraq , but the threat of a United Nations deployment may have deterred some countries fromviolence .<-->N
Peace-enforcement by the United Nations has worked to some extent , but theimpartiality of the United Nations should not be compromised .<-->N
Slow reactions to crisis havemeant the United Nations has become arguably overzealous in its humanitarian missions .<-->O
Although set up as a power that could prevent the outbreak of war , America has shown it willnot be controlled by the United Nations and considers itself more a partner of the UnitedNations .<-->O
The global response to a humanitarian crisis is one area in which the UnitedNations agencies responds effectively .<-->N
This is because the United Nations can gain accessto countries which may be hostile to foreign intervention .<-->N
The United Nations is an importantglobal agency which may have made mistakes in the past , but has not failed in its mission tobring peace yet .<-->N
----------------------------------- So here I am preparing for another debate ... THBT the United Nations has failed And I 'm supposed to oppose this motion -LRB- in other words , I 'm supposed to say that the UN has succeeded -RRB- .<-->O
Does anyone have any idea of what the UN has succeeded in ?<-->N
N.b. THBT = this house believes that to me it failed from the 1st second ... it continues to deny my ****** rights so **** UN and anybody down with UN IMHO , the UN 's greatest weakness stems from the current model of the Security Council and the fact that the 5 permanent members have a veto .<-->O
The question really needs to be asked why -LRB- as a Brit -RRB- Britain and France have a permanent seat and Germany and Japan don t -LRB- answer : probably something to do with the victorious side in WW2 and the possession of Nuclear weapons . -RRB-<-->O
Fix the security council and it might actually get somewhere But equally , the question needs to be asked as to why , for example , China is able to veto anything to do with human rights .<-->O
However , besides that , what are its successes ?<-->N
Well ... It has the world relatively peaceful for over 60 years .<-->N
Yes there have been wars , there have been disagreements .<-->F
However , nothing on the scale of WW1 or 2 where millions died .<-->F
Equally , it has a arguably had a role in preventing a WW3 .<-->N
There has undoubtedly been a role in preventing and ending smaller conflicts around the world .<-->N
Not to mention its role in establishing and protecting basic human rights - attempting to prevent anything like the Holocaust ever happening again .<-->O
Again there have been failures , such as ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia , but some of these can equally be put down to the unwillingness of the big powers to intervene in a timely manner .<-->O
The likes of its subsidiary organisations -LRB- such as the World Health Organisation -RRB- have also in no small part contributed to aid operations and the eradication of diseases such as Small Pox .<-->N
The failures , such as that with TB again have been largely down to the developed world not wanting to spend the money to eradicate diseases that -LRB- at the time -RRB- no longer effected us .<-->O
Problem is , that failure has meant that TB has come back in a form resistant to anti-biotics to bite the developed world on its backsideYou have a very hard task ahead of you ... the only things that the UN can seem to accomplish are the international criminal courts which prosecute war crimes from the wars they seem powerless to stop ... and the work the gets done the the world health organization and the poverty and malaria issues in africa ... the UN has not failed , however it could serve as a `` template '' for transforming itself into an organization that could provide some influence ... .<-->O
however with the unrest in the world today , there is little chance of unify any nations to change the UN ... -------------- Macalaster College has a strong history of interna tionalism and takes great pride in both its scholarship and its truly global focus .<-->O
It is also an institution that welcomes diversity of ideas and open debate , the hall marks of what higher learning is all about in this great nation of America .<-->O
It is fitting that Macalaster has chosen the United Nations as the topic of discussion for its 2006 Round table , as the U.N. faces some of the greatest challenges in its history , ranging from the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan to the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea .<-->O
This year also marks the end of Kofi Annan 's decade-long tenure as U.N. Secretary-General and his handover of power to South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki Moon .<-->N
In a recent interview with the London Daily Tele graph , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton described the U.N. as hopelessly out of touch and stuck in a Twilight Zone-style `` time warp '' where `` there are practices , attitudes and approaches that were abandoned 30 years ago in much of the rest of the world . ''<-->O
-LSB- 1 -RSB- There are many Americans who would agree with Mr. Bolton .<-->N
In a March 2006 poll conducted by Gallup in the United States , 64 percent of respondents said the United Nations was `` doing a poor job , '' the most nega tive American rating for the U.N. in its history .<-->N
Just 28 percent had a positive image of the U.N. 's job perfor mance .<-->N
At the same time , however , 68 percent of those surveyed supported the U.N. 's playing `` a major role '' in world affairs , with 26 percent supporting the view that the U.N. should play a `` leading role . ''<-->O
-LSB- 2 -RSB- The Gallup poll highlights the rather schizo phrenic approach the American public takes toward the U.N. .<-->N
There can be little doubt that the U.N. 's image has taken a beating in the past few years in the United States , from the halls of Congress to the towns and cities of Middle America .<-->O
The Oil-for-Food and Congo peacekeeping scan dals have had a devastating impact on the U.N. 's rep utation , reinforcing the view that the world body is riddled with corruption and mismanagement , as well as a complete lack of discipline in its peacekeeping operations .<-->O
The spectacular failure of the hugely dis credited U.N. Commission on Human Rights -LRB- now the U.N. Human Rights Council -RRB- , populated with some of the world 's worst human rights violators , has added to the U.N. 's poor image .<-->O
In addition , the ten sions between Washington and Turtle Bay over the war in Iraq have contributed to bringing U.S.-U.N. relations to their lowest point in a generation .<-->O
At the same time , however , there remains a con sensus in the United States , whether on Capitol Hill or in Kansas City , that the U.N. still has an impor tant role to play-for now at least-in both interna tional security matters and humanitarian efforts .<-->O
While disenchantment with the U.N. is rising sig nificantly , there is at this time no significant chorus of calls for the U.S. to immediately walk away from the U.N. Both Congress and the executive branch have focused heavily in the past year on advancing the reform of the United Nations rather than desert ing the institution altogether .<-->O
Washington has looked to the U.N. Security Council to play a role in the Iranian and North Korean nuclear issues , as well as the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping to help prevent further mass killing in the Sudan .<-->O
The U.N. may not be loved , but it is still seen as a valuable forum and tool for advancing U.S. interests on the international stage .<-->O
Despite its myriad failings , and its glaring inade quacies , the United Nations is still viewed , in the immediate term , as an institution that merits U.S. investment and cooperation .<-->O
How long this at times fraught relationship will last , however , remains to be seen , and the world body is to a large degree on probation .<-->O
There is growing impatience in the White House over the slow pace of U.N. reform , and both the House and Senate have been discuss ing in recent months the possibility of withholding a portion of U.S. funding for the U.N. On the inter national stage , while the United States is expected to take the Iranian nuclear question to the Security Council , there is little optimism over the council 's ability to enforce or even to agree to a strict sanc tions regime .<-->O
Nor is there a great deal of faith in the U.N. 's ability to halt the genocide in the Sudan .<-->O
In short , although the United States is actively engaged with the U.N. and wishes it to succeed , there is relatively little confidence in its overall ability .<-->O
The next couple of years will be an important period that may define the future relationship between the United States and the United Nations .<-->N
A great deal depends on the institutional and man agement reforms that must take place if the U.N. is to become an effective body and on the willingness of the Group of 77 -LRB- G-77 -RRB- nations to support these changes .<-->O
If these reforms are not implemented , there can be no doubt that Washington will respond with budget cuts .<-->O
In addition , the long-term willingness of the United States to work through the Security Council in addressing major threats to international security will depend heavily upon how the council responds to the threat posed by Iran and North Korea .<-->O
If the U.N. proves impotent in the Sudan , as it did over Rwanda and Bosnia , it will be viewed as an irrele vance in terms of humanitarian intervention .<-->O
Simi larly , if the new U.N. Human Rights Council does not succeed in exorcising the demons of the former Human Rights Commission , there can be no pros pect of the U.S. seeking a seat in future years .<-->N
Despite a series of well-publicized scandals and significant international failures , U.S. taxpayers and policymakers are still willing to give the U.N. one more chance .<-->O
If , however , the United Nations fails to rise to the challenge , it will become an irrele vance , with gradual U.S. disengagement a strong possibility .<-->O
The future of the U.N. is largely in the hands of the U.N. Secretariat and the General Assembly , especially the G-77 .<-->N
There is a popularly held view , especially in the developing world , that the United States dominates the U.N. and that reform is merely an exercise in enhancing American power .<-->O
This is , of course , a myth .<-->N
U.S. power within the U.N. is limited , and all too often the U.N. is used as a multilateral vehicle with which to rein in the American superpower , especially by strategic competitors such as Russia , China , India , and France .<-->O
However , the U.N. without the United States is a greatly weakened organization financially , political ly , and strategically .<-->N
Without the presence of the world 's greatest power , the U.N. would be an impo tent body , lacking in legitimacy , financially insecure , and doomed to go down the same path as its prede cessor , the League of Nations .<-->O
The U.N. needs the United States , and it is in the interests of the world body to undergo thorough reform to make it an effective and relevant world organization for the 21st century .<-->O
The U.N. needs America more than America needs the U.N. .<-->N
This essay examines the reasons why the United Nations has failed in the past decade and puts for ward recommendations for reform as well as U.S. policy regarding the U.N. .<-->O
It also asks whether the world body can survive in the increasingly danger ous and divided world of the 21st century .<-->O
U.S.Involvement in the United Nations It is often suggested that the United States does not pull its weight when it comes to the United Nations and is a reluctant and unenthusiastic mem ber .<-->N
This was the main theme of a controversial speech given by Deputy U.N. Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown in New York in June .<-->N
-LSB- 3 -RSB- In remarks described as `` the worst mistake '' by a U.N. official in a quarter-century , Malloch Brown warned of the `` serious consequences of a decades-long ten dency by U.S. Administrations of both parties to engage only fitfully with the UN '' and condemned `` the prevailing practice of seeking to use the UN almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics . ''<-->O
The U.N. 's Number Two chastised the Bush Administration because it had not sufficiently `` highlighted '' where the U.S. and the U.N. are `` con structively engaged '' and instead had `` abandoned '' the topic to conservative sections of the U.S. media that promulgate `` unchecked UN-bashing and ste reotyping . ''<-->N
What is needed in response , he declared , is for America 's leaders to support the U.N. `` not just in a whisper but in a coast to coast shout that pushes back the critics domestically and wins over the skeptics internationally . ''<-->O
The speech was also an extraordinary intervention in domestic American politics .<-->N
In what can only be described as the first political stump speech made by an international civil servant on U.S. soil in a critical U.S. election year , Malloch Brown rallied his largely partisan audience with these stirring words : Back in Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt 's day building a strong , effective UN that could play this kind of role was a bipartisan enterprise , with the likes of Arthur Vandenberg and John Foster Dulles joining Democrats to support the new body .<-->O
Who are their successors in American politics ?<-->N
Who will campaign in 2008 for a new multilateral national security ?<-->N
Malloch Brown 's controversial speech is part of a growing trend toward intervention in U.S. political affairs by U.N. officials .<-->N
Kofi Annan sparked a major controversy in September 2004 , just weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election , when he described the war with Iraq as an `` illegal '' violation of the U.N. Charter in an interview with the BBC .<-->O
Annan fol lowed these remarks with a further intervention on the Iraq issue in November 2004 , when he wrote a letter to U.S. , British , and Iraqi leaders appealing for Coalition forces to hold back from retaking the insurgent-held city of Fallujah .<-->O
More recently , the Secretary-General tried to influence the American political debate on immi gration in a June 5 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal .<-->N
-LSB- 4 -RSB- Although it eschewed specific mention of the Unit ed States , Annan 's article , as well as the release of new U.N. research on migration , was timed for maximum impact on the immigration issue and arrived just as the House and Senate were working to reconcile major immigration legislation .<-->O
Such interventions are inappropriate for U.N. officials and should be rebuffed by both political parties as improper intervention in U.S. domestic politics .<-->O
Malloch Brown 's speech was not only a highly politicized polemic ; it was also a spectacularly unfair assessment of America 's commitment to the United Nations .<-->O
The United States has been the United Nations ' biggest contributor since it was founded in 1945 , contributing over $ 5 billion annually to the world body .<-->N
The U.S. gives around $ 400 million a year toward the U.N. 's routine operating expenses-22 percent of the U.N. 's regular annual operating bud get and more than the combined contributions of France , Germany , China , Canada , and Russia .<-->F
In addition , it provides over $ 400 million a year to the U.N. 's specialized agencies .<-->F
The U.S. contributes 48 percent of the World Food Program budget , 31 percent of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees budget , and 17 percent of the UNICEF budget .<-->F
The United States is the world 's biggest contributor to U.N. peacekeeping operations , funding 27 percent of the total world wide U.N. peacekeeping budget .<-->F
The U.S. now con tributes over $ 1 billion a year toward U.N. peacekeeping activities .<-->F
Between 2001 and 2005 , the United States contributed $ 3.59 billion toward U.N. international peacekeeping operations .<-->F
The United States is the biggest financial con tributor to the U.N. Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- MONUC -RRB- , providing about one-third of its $ 746 million operating budget .<-->N
The U.S. contribution to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Congo has been substantial .<-->N
If 2005 figures are included , the U.S. has contributed roughly three-quarters of a billion dollars -LRB- $ 759 million -RRB- toward MONUC since 2000 , according to State Department figures .<-->N
-LSB- 5 -RSB- The Failure of the United Nations The history of the United Nations over the past 12 years has been dominated by scandal , division , and failure .<-->O
From the disaster of the U.N. peace keeping missions in Rwanda and Bosnia in the mid-1990s to the U.N. 's slow response to the Sudan genocide , the U.N. 's recent track record has been spectacularly unimpressive .<-->O
The tenure of Kofi Annan , which began in January 1997 and ends in December 2006 , has been one of the least successful of any Secretary-General .<-->N
His successor will inherit a largely poisoned chalice , a U.N. whose image has slipped to an all-time low .<-->O
The U.N. 's failure has been multifaceted and can not be ascribed to one single cause .<-->N
It is partly a failure of leadership , combined with poor management , disci pline , and widespread inefficiency , as well as a deep-seated culture of corruption .<-->O
It is also due to a lack of moral clarity on the international stage-an unwill ingness to confront acts of genocide or totalitarian regimes , coupled with a ready willingness to accom modate tyrants and dictators .<-->O
It has led to a loss of faith in the U.N. 's ability to stand up even for its own Universal Charter of Human Rights , or protect the world 's most vulnerable people , including victims of ethnic cleansing and refugees seeking protection under the U.N. 's flag .<-->O
Whatever the causes of the U.N. 's failure and weakness , there can be no doubt that it is an orga nization in a state of crisis , unsure of its future , mired in scandal , suffering from a lack of direction , and morally ambiguous in outlook .<-->O
In other words , it is a world body that is increasingly ill-equipped for the demands of the 21st century and working its way towards irrelevance unless it undergoes a trans formation .<-->O
The U.N. today is best described as a sickly patient awaiting a blood transfusion .<-->O
Human Rights Failures.The United Nations has let down millions of the world 's weakest and most vulnerable people in Africa and the Balkans .<-->O
The U.N. 's failure to prevent the slaughter of thousands of Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995 and the mass kill ing of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 are shameful episodes that will haunt the United Nations for generations .<-->O
There are echoes today of Bosnia and Rwanda in the killing fields of Darfur in the Sudan , a trag edy that the U.N. initially refused to categorize as genocide .<-->N
Over 200,000 people have lost their lives , many of them at the hands of the Janjaweed militias , backed by the Sudanese government .<-->N
Sudan , a country with an appalling human rights track record , was an active member of the now-defunct U.N. Commission on Human Rights from 2002 to 2005 .<-->O
It used its membership to help block censure from the United Nations .<-->O
Zimba bwe , another African country with a horrific record of abusing the rights of its citizens , sat on the council from 2003 to 2005 .<-->N
The commission reached its low point in 2003 when Libya was elected chairman with the backing of 33 members , with just three countries voting against .<-->O
It was eventually replaced amidst much fanfare in 2006 by the new United Nations Human Rights Council .<-->N
Unfortunately , the 47-seat body is not a significant improvement over its hugely dis credited predecessor .<-->N
The council 's lack of member ship criteria renders it open to participation and manipulation by the world 's worst human rights abusers .<-->O
Tyrannical regimes such as Burma , Syria , Libya , Sudan , and Zimbabwe all voted in favor of establishing the council in the face of strong U.S. opposition .<-->O
The brutal North Korean dictatorship also gave the council its ringing endorsement .<-->O
When council elections were held in May , leading human rights abusers Algeria , China , Cuba , Paki stan , Russia , and Saudi Arabia were all elected .<-->N
The United States was right in its decision not to seek a seat on a council tainted by the odor of despo tism and tyranny .<-->O
While making every effort to push for reform within the U.N. , the United States must seek the creation of a complementary human rights body outside of the U.N. system that would be com posed solely of democratic states that adhere to the basic principles of individual liberty and freedom .<-->O
UNESCO and Hugo Ch vez.The Human Rights Council is far from being the only U.N. body to serve as a platform for despots and dictators .<-->N
The United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization -LRB- UNESCO -RRB- awarded its 2005 Jos Mart International Prize to Venezuelan president Hugo Ch vez .<-->N
Cuban president Fidel Castro per sonally handed the award to his leading imitator as an estimated 200,000 people in Revolution Plaza watched .<-->N
The Mart prize is intended to recognize those who have contributed to the `` struggle for lib erty '' in Latin America .<-->O
Ch vez is clearly not among this group , and the award was a major embarrass ment to the United Nations , illustrating a long standing lack of moral clarity within the world body on issues of individual freedom and liberty .<-->O
Founded after the Second World War , UNESCO was established `` to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among nations through education , science and culture in order to further universal respect for justice , for the rule of law and for the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the world . ''<-->O
But UNESCO has had a controversial his tory .<-->N
The United States boycotted the organization for 18 years , from 1985 through 2003 , in protest over its budgetary mismanagement and radical agenda , including policies opposed to democracy and freedom of the press .<-->O
The United States rejoined UNESCO on the understanding that it was undergoing significant financial and management reform and had `` resumed efforts to reinforce founding principles . ''<-->O
The award to Hugo Ch vez was an affront to the founding vision of UNESCO and the latest blow to the U.N. 's rapidly declining reputation on human rights and democracy .<-->O
Aside from Burma , Sudan , Iran , and Zimbabwe -LRB- all members of UNESCO -RRB- , the U.N. would have to struggle to find two more repres sive regimes than Venezuela and Cuba to glorify .<-->O
Peacekeeping Failures : The Congo Peacekeep ing Scandal.The U.N. 's human rights failure has been compounded by a series of peacekeeping scan dals , from Bosnia to Burundi to Sierra Leone .<-->N
By far the worst instances of abuse have taken place in the Congo , the U.N. 's second largest peacekeeping mis sion , with 16,000 peacekeepers .<-->O
In the Congo , acts of barbarism have been perpe trated by United Nations peacekeepers and civilian personnel entrusted with protecting some of the weakest and most vulnerable women and children in the world .<-->O
Personnel from the U.N. Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- MONUC -RRB- stand accused of at least 150 major human rights violations .<-->O
This is almost certainly just the tip of the iceberg : The scale of the problem is likely to be far greater .<-->O
The crimes involve rape and forced prostitution of women and young girls across the country , including inside a refugee camp in the town of Bunia in north eastern Congo .<-->N
The alleged perpetrators include U.N. military and civilian personnel from Nepal , Morocco , Tunisia , Uruguay , South Africa , Pakistan , and France .<-->N
The victims are defenseless refugees - many of them children-who have already been brutalized and terrorized by years of war and who looked to the U.N. for safety and protection .<-->N
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan acknowl edged that `` acts of gross misconduct have taken place . ''<-->N
A draft United Nations report described sex ual exploitation by U.N. personnel in the Congo as `` significant , widespread and ongoing . ''<-->O
In the words of William Lacy Swing , Annan 's special representa tive to the Congo , `` We are shocked by it , we 're out raged , we 're sickened by it .<-->N
Peacekeepers who have been sworn to assist those in need , particularly those who have been victims of sexual violence , instead have caused grievous harm . ''<-->O
-LSB- 6 -RSB- The sexual abuse scandal in the Congo makes a mockery of the U.N. 's professed commitment to upholding basic human rights .<-->O
U.N. peacekeepers and the civilian personnel who work with them should be symbols of the international community 's commitment to protecting the weak and innocent in times of war .<-->O
The exploitation of some of the most vulnerable people in the world-refugees in a war-ravaged country-is a shameful episode and a massive betrayal of trust .<-->O
Corruption : The-Oil-for-Food Scandal.The scandal surrounding the U.N.-administered Oil-for-Food Program has also done immense damage to the world organization 's already shaky credibility .<-->O
The Oil-for-Food scandal is undoubtedly the biggest scan dal in the history of the United Nations and probably the largest financial fraud in modern times .<-->O
It has shattered the illusion that the U.N. is the arbiter of moral authority in the international sphere .<-->O
Oil for Food became the hottest investigative issue on Capitol Hill in a generation .<-->N
Investigators exam ined huge amounts of evidence relating to corrup tion , fraud , and bribery on an epic scale ; French and Russian treachery ; and the attempts of a brutal total itarian regime to manipulate members of the U.N. Security Council .<-->O
Set up in the mid-1990s as a means of providing humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people , the U.N.-run Oil-for-Food Program was subverted and manipu lated by Saddam Hussein 's regime , allegedly with the complicity of U.N. officials , to help prop up the Iraqi dictator .<-->N
Saddam 's dictatorship was able to siphon off billions of dollars from the program through oil smuggling and systematic thievery , by demanding illegal payments from companies buying Iraqi oil , and through kickbacks from those selling goods to Iraq-all under the noses of U.N. bureaucrats .<-->O
The program has been investigated by no fewer than five congressional committees-two in the Senate , three in the House of Representatives : the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , the House International Relations Committee , the House Subcommittee on Government Reform , and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce .<-->N
There are three U.S. federal investigations still underway : by the Government Accountability Office -LRB- GAO -RRB- , the Department of Justice , and the U.S. Treasury .<-->N
In addition , the 18-month , $ 34 million U.N.-appointed Independent Inquiry Committee -LRB- IIC -RRB- documented a huge amount of evidence regarding manipulation of the $ 60 billion program by the Saddam Hussein regime with the complicity of more than 2,200 companies in 66 countries as well as a number of prominent international politicians .<-->O
-LSB- 7 -RSB- The three-member committee was chaired by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker .<-->N
The other two committee members were South African Justice Richard Goldstone and Swiss profes sor of criminal law Mark Pieth .<-->F
According to the IIC 's report , `` Oil surcharges were paid in connection with the contracts of 139 compa nies and humanitarian kickbacks were paid in con nection with the contracts of 2,253 companies . ''<-->N
Companies accused of paying kickbacks to the Iraqi regime include major global corporations such as DaimlerChrysler , Siemens , and Volvo .<-->N
The Saddam Hussein regime received illicit income of $ 1.8 billion under the Oil-for-Food Program .<-->N
$ 228.8 million was derived from the payment of surcharges in connec tion with oil contracts .<-->F
$ 1.55 billion came through kickbacks on humanitarian goods .<-->N
The 500-page report painted an ugly tableau of bribery , kickbacks , corruption , and fraud on a glo bal scale .<-->O
It amply demonstrates how the Iraqi dic tator generously rewarded those who supported the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and who paid lip-service to his barbaric regime .<-->O
Oil-for-Food became a shameless political charade through which Sadd am Hussein attempted to manipulate decision-mak ing at the U.N. Security Council by buying the support of influential figures in countries such as Russia and France .<-->O
The evidence presented was comprehensive , damning , and a wake-up call to those who naively believed that the Saddam Hussein regime could be trusted to comply with U.N. sanctions .<-->O
Saddam 's multibillion-dollar fraud , carried out with the com plicity of prominent political figures across Europe as well as thousands of international companies , was halted only by the liberation of Iraq by the Unit ed States and Great Britain , in the face of deter mined opposition by France and Russia .<-->O
It is not difficult to see why powerful political interests in Paris and Moscow were so fundamentally opposed to a war that would open the archives of Baghdad to close scrutiny and subsequently cause huge politi cal embarrassment .<-->O
The report should prompt widespread soul-searching within the United Nations , whose admin istrators turned a blind eye to massive wrongdoing in a humanitarian program designed to help the weakest and most vulnerable in Iraq .<-->O
The fact that the Baathist regime was able to get away with such a vast scandal under the noses of U.N. bureaucrats , and in some cases with their complicity , represents both spectacular incompetence and extremely poor leadership at the top of the world body .<-->O
The overall IIC investigation should not , though , be viewed as the final say on the Oil-for-Food scan dal .<-->N
It should be seen as an important but at times flawed and incomplete inquiry that left many ques tions unanswered in relation to the role of senior U.N. officials , including Kofi Annan and his chief aide , Iqbal Riza .<-->O
In future years , the Secretary-General should not be permitted to hand-pick the investigative com mittee inquiring into a U.N. scandal and then pass it off as `` independent . ''<-->O
Such inquiries will always be open to the possibility of political interference and manipulation by those being investigated .<-->O
The United States should insist that future investigations into U.N. scandals be completely independent of the Secretary-General .<-->O
Chairmen of such inquiries should also be asked to disclose , upon appoint ment , all potential conflicts of interest , whether business or political .<-->O
The Volcker inquiry was less than forthright in its analysis of possible wrongdoing and incompetence at the very top of the U.N. Secretariat , a point sharp ly highlighted by the resignation of former FBI agent Robert Parton , the IIC 's lead investigator on the Kofi Annan/Kojo Annan issue .<-->O
Parton resigned on a matter of principle , in protest at the Volcker Committee 's unwillingness to take a harder line regarding the actions of the Secretary-General .<-->O
Par ton subsequently handed over thousands of pages of documents relating to the Annan investigation to the House International Relations Committee .<-->N
According to the second interim report released by the Volcker Committee , -LSB- 8 -RSB- Iqbal Riza , Kofi Annan 's chief of staff , authorized the shredding of thousands of U.N. documents between April and December 2004 .<-->F
Among these documents were the entire U.N. Chef de Cabinet chronological files for 1997 , 1998 , and 1999-many of which related to the Oil-for-Food Program .<-->N
Riza approved this destruction just 10 days after he had personally written to the heads of nine U.N.-related agencies that administered the Oil-for-Food Program in Northern Iraq , requesting that they `` take all necessary steps to collect , preserve and secure all files , records and documents relating to the Oil-for-Food Programme . ''<-->O
The destruction con tinued for more than seven months after the Secre tary-General 's June 1 , 2004 , order to U.N. staff members `` not to destroy or remove any documents related to the Oil-for-Food programme that are in their possession or under their control , and to not instruct or allow anyone else to destroy or remove such documents . ''<-->O
Significantly , Kofi Annan announced the retire ment of Mr. Riza on January 15 , 2005-the same day that Riza notified the Volcker Committee that he had destroyed the documents .<-->N
Riza was immedi ately replaced by Mark Malloch Brown , Administra tor of the U.N. Development Programme .<-->N
Riza was chief of staff from 1997 to 2004 , almost the entire period of the Oil-for-Food Program 's operation , and undoubtedly possessed intricate knowledge of the U.N. 's management of it .<-->O
He was a long-time col league of Kofi Annan and served as Annan 's deputy in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations from 1993 to 1996 .<-->N
The destruction of highly sensitive documents by Iqbal Riza was an obstruction of justice that demands congressional investigation .<-->O
It gave the impression of a major cover-up at the very heart of the United Nations and cast a dark cloud over the Secretary-General 's credibility .<-->O
It projected an image of impunity , arrogance , and unaccountability on the part of the leadership of the United Nations .<-->N
The Volcker investigation may have ended , but several other major inquiries will continue to gain momentum and reveal new findings relating to the Oil-for-Food scandal .<-->O
These include the leading investigations on Capitol Hill , led by the House International Relations Committee and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , in addition to the Department of Justice inquiry .<-->N
It will be many months , even years , before the full extent of the corruption and mismanagement within the United Nations is completely exposed .<-->O
Questions About the U.N. Tsunami Relief Effort.The Oil-for-Food Program is one of several U.N. operations to raise major concerns over trans parency and accountability .<-->N
The U.N. 's much-vaunted tsunami relief operation has also sparked doubts regarding the U.N. 's ability to manage a huge humanitarian project .<-->O
The tsunami disaster which struck large sec tions of Southeast Asia , South Asia , and East Afri ca on December 26 , 2004 , claimed some 231,000 lives and displaced 2 million people .<-->O
It prompted an outpouring of humanitarian help from around the world , with an estimated total of $ 13.6 billion in aid pledged , including $ 6.16 billion in govern ment assistance , $ 2.3 billion from international financial institutions , and $ 5.1 billion from indi viduals and companies .<-->N
-LSB- 9 -RSB- The huge international relief effort was co-coor dinated by the United Nations and involved an astonishing 39 U.N. agencies , from the United Nations Children 's Fund -LRB- UNICEF -RRB- and United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization -LRB- UNESCO -RRB- to the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- and the International Labor Organization -LRB- ILO -RRB- .<-->O
When the U.N. took over the tsunami relief oper ation in early 2005 , the world body pledged full transparency , in light of its disastrous handling of the Iraq Oil-for-Food Program .<-->O
The U.N. 's Under-Secre tary-General for Humanitarian Affairs , Jan Egeland , boasted in an opinion editorial that `` only the UN has the universal legitimacy , capacity , and credibility to lead in a truly global humanitarian emergency . ''<-->O
-LSB- 10 -RSB- Egeland had earlier criticized the U.S. contribution to the tsunami relief effort as `` stingy . ''<-->N
-LSB- 11 -RSB- An investigation by the Financial Times , however , raised serious questions regarding the U.N. 's han dling of the tsunami relief effort , in particular the way in which it spent the first $ 590 million of its $ 1.1 billion disaster `` flash appeal . ''<-->O
The appeal included nearly $ 50 million from the United States .<-->N
The two-month FT inquiry revealed that `` as much as a third of the money raised by the UN for its tsu nami response was being swallowed up by salaries and administrative overheads . ''<-->N
-LSB- 12 -RSB- In contrast , Oxfam , a British-based private charity , spent just 10 percent of the tsunami aid money it raised on administrative costs .<-->O
Unable to obtain figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- OCHA -RRB- , the FT approached several U.N. agencies directly to establish exact numbers for tsunami relief expendi ture .<-->O
Many `` declined or ignored '' requests for infor mation , while others offered incomplete data .<-->N
The newspaper found that of the $ 49 million spent by the World Health Organization as part of the tsuna mi appeal , 32 percent had been spent on `` personnel costs , administrative overheads , or associated ` mis cellaneous ' costs . ''<-->N
At the World Food Program , 18 percent of the $ 215 million spent by the agency went toward `` staff salaries , administrative over heads and vehicles and equipment . ''<-->N
-LSB- 13 -RSB- The Financial Times concluded that : -LSB- A -RSB- year after the tsunami , pledges of trans parency and accountability for the UN 's ap peal appear a long way from being realized .<-->O
This is primarily blamed on dueling UN bu reaucracies and accounting methods plus what in many cases appears to be institu tional paranoia about disclosure .<-->N
-LSB- 14 -RSB- Reforming the United Nations The United States should press for immediate reform in three key areas : accountability and trans parency , peacekeeping , and human rights .<-->O
Accountability and Transparency.The United States should call for the creation of an external watchdog body to oversee U.N. operations .<-->N
The U.N. 's Office of Internal Oversight Services lacks the tools , the expertise , the public confidence , and - above all-the independence to conduct effective , transparent , and impartial investigations into allega tions of large-scale fraud and mismanagement within the United Nations .<-->O
An external oversight body , com pletely independent of the U.N. bureaucracy and staffed with non-U.N. officials -LRB- but backed by a Secu rity Council mandate -RRB- , should be established to over see major U.N. operations , including humanitarian programs and peacekeeping operations .<-->O
Congress should support the establishment of a U.S. oversight unit to monitor how American contributions are spent by the U.N. .<-->O
The United States should set up its own U.N. oversight unit specifically charged with monitoring the use of American contributions to U.N. peacekeeping and humanitarian operations .<-->O
This should be funded by diverting part of the annual U.S. assessed contri bution for the United Nations and could be located in the U.S. Mission to the United Nations .<-->O
Congress should also call for the U.N. to establish an independent archive facility to house copies of all major U.N. documents , to guard against the shred ding of sensitive files by U.N. officials under inves tigation .<-->O
The facility should be located on a site separate from the U.N. headquarters .<-->N
Copies of sig nificant U.N. documents and correspondence -LRB- for example , Chef de Cabinet and Secretariat files -RRB- should be deposited within a set period from time of production .<-->N
Such a facility should be funded by cut ting wasteful U.N. programs .<-->O
There should also be regular auditing of all U.N. finances and expenditures , conducted by a leading accounting firm .<-->O
In addition , U.N. personnel charged with criminal behavior should be immedi ately stripped of diplomatic immunity to open the way for prosecution .<-->O
The legal costs of U.N. officials charged with criminal behavior should not be paid for by the United Nations and should be the respon sibility of the individual concerned .<-->O
Peacekeeping.The Congo episode further under mined the credibility of the United Nations and raised serious questions regarding the effectiveness of the U.N. 's leadership .<-->O
The U.N. has consistently failed to publicize , prevent , and punish the criminal behavior of its own personnel in trouble spots around the world .<-->O
Congress should make it clear to the United Nations that continued robust U.S. funding of U.N. peacekeeping will be contingent upon the elimination of all forms of abuse within its peacekeeping opera tions .<-->O
Congress should withhold a percentage of the U.S. contribution to U.N. peacekeeping operations unless U.N. personnel responsible for criminal activi ty are brought to justice and safeguards are put in place to prevent future abuses from taking place .<-->O
The United States should call for a Security Coun cil-backed , fully independent investigation into the MONUC abuse scandal , to cover all areas of the MONUC operation .<-->O
In addition , there should be independent investigations launched into allegations of abuse by U.N. personnel in other U.N. peacekeep ing operations , including Kosovo , Sierra Leone , Liberia , and Burundi .<-->O
Fully independent commis sions of inquiry should handle all future investiga tions into human rights abuses by U.N. personnel .<-->O
The United States government should pressure U.N. member states to prosecute their nationals accused of human rights violations while serving as U.N. peacekeepers .<-->O
The U.N. should lift diplomatic immunity for its own staff accused of criminal acts in the Congo , opening the way for prosecution .<-->O
The Security Council should exclude countries whose peacekeepers have a history of human rights viola tions from future operations .<-->O
The U.N. should pub licly name and shame those countries whose peacekeepers have carried out abuses in the Congo .<-->O
The U.N. should make publicly available all internal reports relating to the Congo scandal and outline the exact steps it plans to take to prevent the sexual exploitation of refugees in both existing and future U.N. peacekeeping operations .<-->O
Serious con sideration should be given to the establishment of an elite training academy for U.N. peacekeeping commanders .<-->N
This effort should be backed by the U.N. Security Council .<-->N
Human Rights.In an ideal world , membership in the United Nations should be restricted to free democracies .<-->O
According to Freedom House , just 89 of the U.N. 's 192 member states are `` fully free '' -LRB- i.e. , 46 percent -RRB- .<-->O
There can be little doubt , though , that any attempt to limit membership in the U.N. would be strongly opposed by the G-77 countries .<-->O
U.S. interests are best served at present by building an alliance of democracies within the U.N. as well as developing human rights structures outside of the United Nations .<-->O
As human rights scholar Joseph Loconte has argued , Congress should appoint an independent Human Rights Ambassador to head a new U.S. Commission on Human Rights .<-->O
It could be mod eled on the U.S. Commission on International Reli gious Freedom , a quasi-governmental group that monitors religious liberty abroad and makes policy recommendations to the President , the Secretary of State , and Congress .<-->O
-LSB- 15 -RSB- The United States should mobilize a `` Democracy Caucus '' to protect human rights and expand dem ocratic freedoms .<-->O
The new U.S. Human Rights Ambassador would lobby other governments in the fledgling Community of Democracies , founded in 2000 in Warsaw , to establish their own human rights commissioners and advisory bodies .<-->N
They must be a morally serious coalition of the willing - operating both within and outside the official U.N. system-that offers a bright alternative to the exist ing Human Rights Council .<-->O
The Case Against Expansion of the Security Council A major reform that would adversely affect the U.N. , as well as American interests , is significant expansion of the Security Council .<-->O
The United States has correctly set increased effectiveness of the Security Council as the bench mark for council reform .<-->O
As the war on terrorism continues to unfold around the globe , as greater urgency is paid to limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction , and as the free world faces a growing threat from rogue regimes such as Iran and North Korea , the U.N. Security Council can play an important and useful role .<-->O
It is in the U.S. national interest to have a lean and effective Security Council that can help address these issues on the interna tional stage .<-->O
Unfortunately , the most prominent proposals to expand the Security Council will have the opposite effect .<-->O
Security Council expansion will make it far more difficult for the United States to work through the council .<-->N
With the exception of Germany and Japan , the voting records of the main contenders for addi tional permanent Security Council seats indicate that they will likely vote against the U.S. on most key issues .<-->O
In other words , a larger Security Council with these nations as permanent members will like ly be less supportive of U.S. policy priorities .<-->O
More over , any enlargement of the council would make it more unwieldy and subject to conflicting interests , contributing to gridlock that will paralyze the coun cil and decrease the probability that it will act quick ly or effectively to address threats to international peace and security .<-->O
The U.N. Security Council 's legitimacy depends far more on its actions than on its membership .<-->N
The Security Council is by no means perfect as it cur rently stands .<-->N
It is subject to delay and indecisive ness , as its failures in Iraq and Sudan clearly demonstrate .<-->O
However , a larger council would not solve these problems .<-->N
On the contrary , it would fur ther undermine the council 's ability to act decisively as timely action would fall victim to political impasse , conflicting interests , or debate among nations that have little to contribute to the council 's ultimate responsibility-enforcement of interna tional peace and security .<-->O
However imperfect , the current composition of the council is infinitely pref erable to ill-considered expansion that will surely weaken its standing and ability to meet its man date-ultimately making the Security Council less relevant and increasing the likelihood that crises will be addressed outside of the U.N. framework .<-->O
From a U.S. national interest point of view , there is a clear-cut case against Security Council expan sion .<-->O
Analysis by The Heritage Foundation of actu al votes -LRB- not including consensus votes -RRB- in the General Assembly over a six-year period -LRB- 1999 to 2004 -RRB- revealed that five of the leading candidates voted against the United States more than 70 per cent of the time .<-->O
-LSB- 16 -RSB- Only Germany -LRB- 55 percent -RRB- and Japan -LRB- 50 per cent -RRB- voted with the U.S. at least half of the time .<-->N
Brazil , the only contender from Latin America , vot ed with the U.S. just 29 percent of the time , while India , often touted as a major future ally of the Unit ed States , voted with the United States just 20 per cent of the time .<-->O
The records of the three leading African contenders for Security Council seats are equally poor .<-->N
Nigeria and South Africa voted with the U.S. just 25 percent of the time , while Egypt - a huge beneficiary of American aid-sided with the U.S. in only 18 percent of the votes .<-->O
Of 190 members of the General Assembly -LRB- not including the U.S. -RRB- , Germany had the best record among Security Council candidates , ranking 12th in voting coincidence with the United States .<-->N
Japan ranks a surprisingly low 41st but is still ahead of any other major country in Asia .<-->O
Brazil ranks 80th , while Nigeria , South Africa , and India rank 104th , 106th , and 149th , respectively .<-->N
Egypt ranks very near the bottom at 168th , behind Sudan and just ahead of rogue regimes such as Libya , Burma , and Syria .<-->O
Significantly , support for U.S. voting positions in the General Assembly has fallen since 1999 -LRB- dra matically in some cases -RRB- for all the countries com peting for Security Council seats .<-->N
While Germany backed the United States in 70 percent of votes in 1999 , it voted with the U.S. just 45 percent of the time in 2004 .<-->N
Similarly , Japanese support for U.S. voting positions fell from 63 percent in 1999 to 43 percent in 2004 .<-->O
In 2004 , Brazil and Nigeria voted with the U.S. just 15 percent of the time , and South Africa voted with the U.S. only 11 percent of the time .<-->N
In 1999 , these three countries voted with the U.S. 39 percent , 35 percent , and 40 percent of the time , respectively .<-->N
Egypt 's record was a pitifully low 8.5 percent in 2004 -LRB- down from 29 percent in 1999 -RRB- .<-->O
India has consistently voted against U.S. positions over the past five years , voting in opposi tion to the U.S. 80 percent of the time in 2004 and 78 percent of the time in 1999 .<-->N
Every year , the U.S. Department of State identi fies votes of fundamental national interest in the U.N. General Assembly .<-->N
Support for the U.S. voting position on key issues over the past five years among the key Security Council contenders has been low -LRB- Brazil , Nigeria , South Africa , India , and Egypt -RRB- to middling -LRB- Japan and Germany -RRB- .<-->O
South Africa and Nigeria voted against the U.S. position on key votes an average of 80 percent of the time between 2000 and 2004 .<-->O
India voted with the U.S. just 19 percent of the time , and Egypt just 16 per cent .<-->O
The Brazilian record was slightly better , voting with the U.S. 35 percent of the time .<-->O
The U.S. did not receive a single vote of support from Nigeria , South Africa , India , or Egypt on any key vote in 2001 .<-->O
While the voting record of Germany and Japan is considerably stronger -LRB- Germany voted with the U.S. 64 percent of the time , and Japan 66 per cent of the time -RRB- , their voting coincidence can hard ly be considered reliable .<-->O
Worse than their actual voting records is the fact that these countries ' opposition to U.S. priorities is increasing .<-->O
Germany , Japan , Brazil , South Africa , and Nigeria have sharply reduced their level of sup port for the U.S. on key votes since 1999 .<-->N
In 2004 , Brazil , Nigeria , India , South Africa , and Egypt voted with the U.S. on just two key votes .<-->O
Germany 's and Japan 's records were slightly better , voting with the U.S. on four votes .<-->O
The Debate over John Bolton Finally , any discussion of the current state of the United Nations and U.S. investment in the U.N. would not be complete without an assessment of the record of John Bolton , the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. -LSB- 17 -RSB- Few political figures in recent American history have so polarized opinion as has John Bolt on .<-->O
Faced with Senate gridlock , Bolton was sent by President George W. Bush as a recess appointment to the United Nations last August .<-->N
Over the past year , Bolton has proven a forceful advocate of American interests , a powerful voice for U.N. reform , and a staunch defender of the cause of human rights .<-->O
He has worked closely with Con gress , testifying no fewer than six times before House and Senate committees .<-->N
Bolton has been an outspoken critic of corruption , mismanagement , waste , and inefficiency .<-->O
He has shaken up an insti tution that has for decades been resistant to change and has cast a revealing light on an elite U.N. estab lishment that has long thrived amidst a culture of complacency and secrecy .<-->O
In three key areas-U.N. reform , human rights , and international security-Bolton 's record has been outstanding , and he has dramatically raised the profile of issues from peacekeeping abuses to the need for increased transparency , accountability , and effectiveness at the United Nations .<-->O
John Bolton 's commitment to both the advancement of U.S. inter ests and the cause of international freedom and security has been unwavering .<-->O
While campaigning for a higher human rights standard at the U.N. , Bolton has also worked tire lessly to push for greater action by the U.N. Securi ty Council and the international community over the genocide in the Darfur region of the Sudan .<-->O
He has played a key role in Security Council negotia tions pressing for greater protection for refugees fleeing Sudanese-backed Janjaweed militias and for targeted sanctions against Sudanese officials impli cated in the killing .<-->O
During his time at the U.N. , John Bolton has been a hugely valuable asset to U.S. foreign policy and has proven his critics wrong .<-->O
Bolton may not be the most popular man at the United Nations , but he is greatly respected and viewed by both friend and foe as a formidable advocate for U.S. interests .<-->O
U.S. par ticipation at the United Nations is not about win ning popularity contests or engaging in feel-good back-slapping exercises .<-->N
It is about steadfast leader ship and the advancement of clear principles and ideals .<-->N
It is in the U.S. national interest to have a United Nations that is free of corruption , fraud , and mismanagement .<-->O
And it is in the national interest to have a world body that actually stands for human rights , that rejects terrorism , and that advances rather than hinders international security .<-->O
Boltonhas not been afraid to speak his mind and upset the status quo .<-->O
Nor has he been unwilling to call a dictator a dictator , expose the rampant hypoc risy of the U.N. 's human rights apparatus , or con demn the actions of dangerous rogue regimes .<-->O
Indeed , I would describe Bolton as a role model for the sort of ambassador the United States needs at the U.N. Effective diplomacy requires forceful lead ership and the willingness to back up tough words with action .<-->O
As former British Prime Minister Marg aret Thatcher observed in a letter of support for John Bolton , `` A capacity for straight talking rather than peddling half-truths is a strength and not a dis advantage in diplomacy .<-->O
In the case of a great power like America , it is essential that people know where you stand and assume you know what you say . ''<-->O
Conclusion : The Future of the United Nations Founded in 1945 with lofty ambitions to advance peace , prosperity , and security in the world , the United Nations can point to few significant achieve ments .<-->O
Its two finest hours-the defense of South Korea in the Korean War and the liberation of Kuwait from Iraq-were both American - and Brit ish-led operations that frankly would have taken place even if the United Nations did not exist .<-->O
With out the United States , the U.N. is little more than an emperor with no clothes .<-->N
The U.N. 's failures , from its inability to stop ethnic cleansing in Rwanda , Bosnia , and Sudan to wide spread abuses by U.N. peacekeepers across Africa , are legion .<-->O
Inaction , incompetence , and even abject inhumanity have all too often been the hallmarks of U.N. operations , which have frequently demonstrated a callous indifference to human suffering .<-->O
The United Nations has gained a well-earned reputation as an institution rife with corruption and dominated by a sleazy political culture of `` see no evil , hear no evil . ''<-->O
The several investigations into the massive Oil-for-Food scandal opened up an unpleasant can of worms .<-->O
Clearly , the United Nations is an institution in fundamental need of wholesale reform and new leadership .<-->O
Much of the blame should be placed on the leadership of the U.N. , including the Secretary-General .<-->N
The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , marked a watershed moment in the history of the love-hate relationship between the world 's biggest superpower and an international body determined to reign in a Goliath .<-->N
America did not look to the U.N. in responding to the biggest attack on its soil since Pearl Harbor .<-->N
Indeed , the United Nations was largely an irrelevant bystander as U.S. , British , and other allied forces stormed Afghanistan , the safe haven of al-Qaeda .<-->O
The U.S.-led war on terrorism has become a major wedge dividing the United States and the U.N. establishment .<-->O
The U.N. can not even agree on a definition of terrorism , let alone take an aggressive stance against it .<-->O
America 's approach to fighting ter rorism , from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to the practice of rendition of terrorist suspects , has become the subject of extreme criticism from U.N. human rights bodies , such as the Human Rights Committee and Council on Human Rights , as well as other supranational institutions such as the Council of Europe .<-->O
Indeed , the war on terrorism has become a huge target for the U.N. 's human rights apparatus , which is increasingly posing a major problem for the United States .<-->O
Tensions between the United States and the U.N. over the treatment of suspected terrorists will greatly com plicate any future cooperation between the two in the battle against al-Qaeda .<-->O
The Iraq war was another watershed in U.S. - U.N. relations .<-->N
Washington only half-heartedly went to the Security Council in 2002 when it con fronted the barbaric regime of Saddam Hussein , and only after intense pressure from British Prime Min ister Tony Blair .<-->O
The liberation of Baghdad was con ducted without the blessing of the council after the most acrimonious of debates , which pitted Wash ington and London against Moscow , Paris , and Beijing .<-->O
To this day , Secretary-General Kofi Annan continues to refer bitterly to the Iraq war as an `` ille gal '' violation of international law , much to the anger of the Bush Administration .<-->O
Despite the rifts over Iraq and the war on terror ism , the United States still remains committed to working with the U.N. However , how long that commitment lasts depends upon the degree to which the institution is reformed and the extent to which the world body serves as an ally or as an obstacle in the war on terrorism and the battle against rogue states , such as Iran , Syria , and North Korea .<-->O
Patience is beginning to run out , and it is likely that animosity toward the U.N. , both inside the Beltway and across America , will probably increase rather than decrease in the years to come .<-->O
The U.N. is increasingly a hindrance rather than a help in the fight against al-Qaeda .<-->O
The United States is likely to clash increasingly with the United Nations over the battle against Islamic extremism , over the interpretation of inter national law , over the defense of Israel in the face of intimidation by Iranian and Syrian-backed militias , over the approach to foreign aid , over the definition of human rights .<-->O
The next decade will be marked by continuing U.S. engagement with the U.N. but growing frustration and mutual distrust between Washington and Turtle Bay .<-->O
The United States will bypass the U.N. where it is seen to be obstructing U.S. interests and will turn to coalitions of the willing in order to deal with specific threats to international security , and even humani tarian crises .<-->O
At the same time , America , together with close allies , may develop more bodies outside of the U.N. system to handle global issues .<-->N
The United Nations will have to compete increasingly in a global marketplace of international institutions .<-->N
Its privileged position as the dominant world body in areas such as human rights , humanitarian relief , and international development could be increasing ly challenged , both by other multilateral institutions or by ad hoc coalitions .<-->O
The U.N. , with its myriad agencies and vast bureaucracy , may struggle to com pete in a 21st century world that demands immedi ate responses to clear and present threats and crises .<-->O
Whether the U.N. goes the way of its predecessor , the League of Nations , and sinks into the abyss of history as an irrelevant failure depends upon its willingness to be reformed as well as its ability to aggressively confront the challenges of today , whether it be the threat of global terrorism , the aggressive actions of a dictatorial regime , or the mass slaughter of one ethnic group by another .<-->O
Ter rorism , tyranny , and genocide remain the three great evils of our time , and the U.N. will be judged by how it responds to them .<-->O
If it is not up to the task , then it will be time to take a bow and give way to a successor .<-->N
-------------------- The formation of the United Nations on October 24 1945 was a response to themuch needed peace and security in the world which the League of Nations hadfailed to maintain security by allowing the threat of Hitler and other dictators causeinsecurity of many innocent civilians worldwide -LRB- Gazzini 2005:50 -RRB- .<-->O
However , in thetwenty first century globalized world , many aspects are now seen as threat tointernational security such as terrorism , nuclear armament , poverty , international andregional disputes , abuse of human rights are some of the major causes of international insecurity.Chapter VI of the Charter indicates the suitable ways of settling global disputes and granted the Security Council certain powers in relation tothese -LRB- Higgins 1995:445 -RRB- .<-->O
All the power to maintain security was given to the SecurityCouncil since its formation which has played a critical role in maintaining security.However , due to some inherent weaknesses and strengths in the functioning of theUnited Nations in ensuring the fulfilment of the founding promise , has becomedifficult to assess whether the organisations had really worked to archive this end.The following essay is going to analyse the achievements and failures of the UnitedNations in maintaining international peace and security .<-->O
As a result of the changingfactors that are considered to bring insecurity , the researcher is going to tackle onissues like the United Nations fight against terrorism , nuclear disarmament andcontrol , settling of international and regional conflicts and poverty in relation to howthe world body has generally won and failed to achieve its founding promises of maintaining security.With no doubt , the United Nations was so reluctant in joining the fight againstterrorism until 1985 -LRB- Chandra 2006:145 -RRB- .<-->O
Under Chapter 1 of the United Nations , theorganisation took the obligation to maintain international peace and security , and tothat end : to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace , and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breachesof the peace which include acts of terrorism -LRB- Vark 2009:219 -RRB- .<-->O
The security councilwhich is the custodian of maintaining peace and security only recognised the use of the term in December 1985 and the Lockerbie bomber of 1988 presented the UnitedNations with the chance to stamp authority over terrorism with the United States of America , United Kingdom and France who are permanent members in the securitycouncil .<-->O
They demanded the release of the terrorist by Libya for punishment at theinternational criminal court because of the security threat it had caused.However , due to political differences within the council at the time -LRB- communist China andSoviet Union versus capitalist big three -RRB- , Libya defied the united nations orders and ittook three years for the security council to denounce Libya s in cooperation to themaintenance of security by sponsoring terrorism.On 11 September 2001 , all the 15 members of the United Nations Security Councilat the 4385 th meeting through resolution 1373 of chapter VII unanimously agreed toestablish anti-terrorism mechanism to monitor and curb terrorism which hadincreased as globalization and technology increased and being marked by terroristattacks on the World Trade Centre -LRB- UN News 2001 -RRB- and several attacks threateninghuman security in London , New Delhi and Moscow .<-->O
The major failure of the UnitedNations is that there have been reactive rather than proactive to terrorism .<-->O
A goodexample when Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces bombarded US embassies in Kenyaand Tanzania in 1998 and the repeat in the September 11 attacks , that is when theSecurity Council started to monitor terrorist activities in Afghanistan and theimmediate result was the October 7 2001 attack on the terrorists in Afghanistanwhich are still operational up to date with its major achievement being the killing of Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden on May 2 2011 -LRB- Haaretz.com 2011:1 -RRB- .<-->O
The movewas also hailed by Ban Ki Moon who was quoted saying , The death of Osama binLaden , is a watershed moment in our common global fight against terrorism '' -LRB- Haaretz.com :1 -RRB- .<-->O
This shows that as long as terrorism still exist as threat to peace andsecurity the United Nations would not yet have achieved any success in maintainingpeace and security because everyday many people will still be threatened by suchactivities.The end of the Second World War was concluded with the use of new and advancedweapons like the hydrogen bombs dropped in Japan .<-->O
After the war , many countriesdeveloped nuclear weapons and energy with the major superpowers spearheadingthe race for nuclear armament -LRB- Higgins 1995:447 -RRB- .<-->N
The earliest efforts to address theissue of transportation and distribution of nuclear technology and arms failed asmany nuclear states helped non-nuclear states to acquire them .<-->N
For example Libyadeveloped the Tajoura Nuclear Research Centre with the assistance of the SovietUnion , beginning in 1982 and that was only discovered in December 2003 whenLibya made surprise announcement of abandoning its weapons of mass destructionafter 18years of violation of the regulations of the UN security council -LRB- Boureston et al 2004:2 -RRB- .<-->O
The end of the Cold War and the threat of U.S. Russian nuclear war greatly reduced the chances of nuclear total destruction .<-->O
Yet the continued existenceof nuclear weapons and the possible diffusion of fissile materials mean that the riskof mass destruction remains and threatening world security especially that other nations have nuclear weapons in secret.Since the formation of United Nations , world-scale disarmament and limitation of have been deemed vital for the maintenance of peace and security and the securitycouncil have amended various laws that apply to its 193 members -LRB- Perkovich2008 :6 -RRB- .<-->O
These include the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons -LRB- NPT -RRB- of 1970 whichaims to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons in the world .<-->N
Other notableinstruments of United Nations Security council Intended to reduce weapons includingthe Chemical weapons convention of 1999 , the abolishing of biologicalweapons -LRB- 1975 -RRB- and the Nuclear test ban treaty of 1996 .<-->N
However , the United Nationshad made considerable achievement in reducing the amount of arms and weaponsof mass destruction especially after 1990 with the dismantling of thousands of nuclear warheads especially by the great powers .<-->O
The security council also madegreat efforts in enforcing its instruments in Korea under the UN resolution 1874 onNorth Korea giving her strong warning not to engage in nuclear activities and respectthe NPT or face collective security and sanctions as a way of preserving security inthe Asian region -LRB- Higgins 1995:447 -RRB- .<-->O
The same procedure of maintaining securitywas also implemented for Iran and Libya when there engaged in nuclear programmes and sanction were placed on them in order for them to abide by thelaws which ensure there is security and peace in the world through reduction of nuclear weapons -LRB- Abbas & Bunn 2006:2 -RRB- .<-->O
Although the United Nations played a pivotal role in controlling the amount of nuclear weapons in the world , it had beenlagging behind in controlling world military expenditure reaching level high of $ 1,5 billion in 2009 -LRB- United Nations 2009 -RRB- which raises the question if UN securitycouncil is really playing the role it had pledged to do so .<-->O
Another critical issue in the maintenance of security by the security council of the UNis to curb regional and international conflicts -LRB- Atta 1995:236 -RRB- .<-->O
During the cold war , the major stakeholders in the UN Security Council , Soviet Union and The UnitedStates acted alone and ignored the orders of the UN and this resulted in thedeath of tens of millions of people in regional and localised international disputesacross the world like in Vietnam and Korea -LRB- Chopra 1995:29 -RRB- .<-->O
However , theSecurity Council had played its part in solving issues of insecurity by solving anumber of regional and international conflicts which were a threat to millions of people .<-->N
From the UN report on its mission in Liberia in 2003 , the organisationmanaged to secure the security of more than 300000 people after resolving theconflict and disarming about 100000 in a year and the dispute was solvedamicably with resolution 1509 of 2003 -LRB- UN news Centre for Disarmament2004 :174 -RRB- .<-->O
It is also critical to note that although the security council may haveproved its importance in countries like the conflicts in D.R.C and other countries , it is also critical to note some of its failures in upholding security during and after the Cold War.In his article entitled The folly of the United Nations , Van Atta -LRB- 1995:2 -RRB- noted that the organisation failed to execute its missions in Rwandawhere they deserted the situation prematurely leaving the Hutus in refugeecamps and 14 Red Cross workers were killed .<-->O
The same thing happened inSomalia in 1992 when the UN was halted by Somali militias in deliveringemergencies and had to rely on the United States to save the masses that werein danger of security concerns .<-->O
Another critical point to note in the operation of the UN in combating conflicts whichare a threat to security can be seen when the organisation failed to stop theUnited States and Iraq in engaging in war in 1990-91 and 2003respectively .<-->O
These wars threatened the security of the Arab world even to datebecause the decisions in the security council are greatly influenced by the greatpowers of which the United States is the key member and it was difficult to halther and as a result many innocent civilians were left with no one to protect whileother great powers were rendered useless -LRB- Duelfer & Dyson 2011:74 -RRB- .<-->O
To add tothat the United Nations also failed to stop the great powers who abused their authority when it watched helplessly as many civilians were killed in the Vietnamand Korea wars because the wars were involving interests of the great powersand there was insecurity in these regions during the era of Cold War.It had totake the pledges of China and Russia to solve the dispute in Cambodia in 1991when the UN security forces abused their powers and finances although therewere involved in the final peace making process after 21years of disputes inCambodia -LRB- Atta 1995:2 -RRB- .<-->O
On a positive note , UN security council had played a vitalrole in solving the Darfur region conflict and brought peace and security with theestablishment of Southern Sudan in 2011 , after decades of conflict .<-->O
Conclusion According to the above thesis on the achievements and failures of the UnitedNations in maintaining security in the world , it can be hailed for successfullyavoiding the Third World War which could have brought some insecurity in aglobalized world.Although what can be used to define world security had evolvedover the years , terrorism , regional and international disputes such as the SuezCrisis , nuclear arms race , poverty and other factors such as droughts , diseasesand natural disasters have caused insecurity in the world , the organisation hastried to minimise insecurity among member nations and the majority of issuescausing insecurity have generally been addressed -LRB- Higgins 1995:455 -RRB- .<-->O
As thefirst international organisation to operate after the Second World War one maybe tempted to conclude that so far the United Nations Through its securityCouncil had so far tried to stick to its founding promises although there are someloopholes which had prevented it from operating on full capacity.These mayinclude the limited number of members which have decision making privileges.No , George Bush has put the United Nations right where he wants them .<-->O
------------------ The United States has over stated their powers of the Geneva Convention , and violated the rules of the United Nations with George Bush , so do n't blame them for Bush breaking ranks .<-->N
yes - with good intentions though - I mean the UN can not even build a force of 20,000 troops for lebanon .<-->O
What if there was a large scale war somewhere else in the world requiring a force of 200,000 soldiers ?<-->O
The only nation martialing a military that big for peacekeeping or peacemaking / bringing freedom / democracy is the U.S .<-->N
The U.N can not even police southern lebanon with a force of 20,000 - which was required by Israel to keep peace there .<-->O
Only a fraction of that force has been put together and several weeks have gone by since the request went out .<-->N
SO they have failed indeed .<-->N
When the UN was established , Churchill expected it to last 10 to15 years before it became another lame tea-sipping debate society like the League of Nations had become .<-->O
Has it failed ?<-->N
Surely it has .<-->N
But then again , look at how many truly horrid nations are in the UN .<-->O
Sudan , China , Cuba , Syria , Iran , Zimbabwe , Saudi Arabia , etc. .<-->N
These are awful nations that should not be members because of their gross violations of their citizens ' human rights .<-->O
They have failed to protect the helpless - Congo , Rwanda , Darfur , Iraq , China , USSR , etc. .<-->N
They 've been party to corruption in enriching bloody tyrant Saddam via their Oil-for-Food scam .<-->O
-------------------------------- The United Nations has failed to perform its duty of maintaining global order , Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament today .<-->N
Mr. Dissanayake who was speaking during an adjournment debate in the House said the UN had been acting in an unfair manner and had not treated all countries alike .<-->O
One can not rely on the UN when it comes to bringing redress to Tamil people ` he said stating that he would like to remind the TNA of this point .<-->O
He said one could not rely on India and USA as well .<-->N
The chief opposition whip actually charged that the Indian intelligence service RAW is destabilizing the North .<-->O
Mr Dissanayake who blended his fire brand speech with a little bit of emotion said a truth commission was essential as the war affected persons no matter what ethnic or religious group he belonged to had the right to know as to what had become of their lost relatives .<-->O
The MP made this point by bringing out his own experience where he said he and his family were still not aware of what had become of his brother who disappeared in 1989 .<-->O
` My mothers_day .<-->N
jsp ' class = black > mother went to the extent of seeking an astrologer to locate my brother `` he said .<-->N
Mr Dissanayake also said people of all races and religions should be treated equally while Sri Lanka should be identified as a multi-racial and multi religious nation .<-->N
------------------------------- Top 10 Failures of the United Nations Terrorism Many experts agree that modern terrorism began with the 1968 hijacking of El Al Israel Flight 426 by a Palestinian terrorist organization .<-->O
The United Nations condemned the action , but failed to take any further action .<-->N
These terrorist acts continued throughout the remainder of the twentieth century , with no reaction from the UN ; a simple condemnation was as far as they would go .<-->O
With the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the UN finally took action , outlawing terrorism and punishing those responsible for the attacks .<-->O
Unfortunately , this applied only to Al Qaeda and the Taliban .<-->N
State-funded terrorist programs such as Hamas , Hezbollah , and Mossad were unaffected .<-->N
Nations that support groups that are widely linked to terrorism , such as Iran , are not held accountable specifically for these actions .<-->O
To this date , the UN still does not have a clear definition of terrorism , and they have no plans to pursue one .<-->O
Nuclear Proliferation At the creation of the UN in 1945 , the United States was the only nation in the world to own and test nuclear weapons .<-->N
In 1970 , the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was signed by 190 nations , including five nations that admitted to owning nuclear weapons : France , England , Russia , China , and the US .<-->N
Despite this treaty , nuclear stockpiles remain high , and numerous nations continue to develop these devastating weapons , including North Korea , Israel , Pakistan , and India .<-->N
The failure of the non-proliferation treaty details the ineffectiveness of the United Nations , and their inability to enforce crucial rules and regulations on offending nations .<-->O
Sri Lanka The small island nation of Sri Lanka experienced a bloody civil war lasting from 1983 to 2009 , pitting the militant , separatist Tamil Tigers against government forces .<-->O
In the final months of the war , the opposing sides were fighting in the heavily populated northeast coastline , a designated safe zone .<-->O
The fighting forced 196,000 people to flee , and trapped over 50,000 civilians .<-->N
Independent experts urged the Human Rights Council of the UN to investigate claims of war crimes , and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon acknowledged being appalled by the situation , but the United Nations made no attempts to intervene on behalf of the civilian population .<-->N
From January to April of 2009 , over 6,500 civilians were killed in this so-called safe-zone .<-->N
Child Sex Abuse Scandal Many nations plead for support from the United Nations in times of desperation and war .<-->O
To the oppressed , the blue helmets of UN peacekeepers represent stability and safety .<-->N
Unfortunately , this was not the case in numerous countries in the 1990s .<-->N
Reports from Bosnia , Kosovo , Cambodia , Haiti , and Mozambique revealed a shocking trend ; areas with peacekeeping forces saw a rapid rise in child prostitution .<-->N
Often , soldiers would reward the children with candy or small sums of money , so they could claim the sexual relationship was prostitution rather than rape .<-->O
Senior officials in the United Nations refused to condemn the peacekeepers , as they feared this public shaming would discourage nations from joining peacekeeping forces .<-->O
Veto Power The United Nations Security Council consists of fifteen nations , five of which are permanent : France , Russia , China , the United States , and the United Kingdom .<-->N
The other ten nations are elected to serve two-year terms .<-->N
The five permanent members enjoy the luxury of veto power ; when a permanent member vetoes a vote , the Council resolution can not be adopted , regardless of international support .<-->O
Even if the other fourteen nations vote yes , a single veto will beat this overwhelming show of support .<-->O
The most recent use of the veto was by China and Russia , on July 19th , 2012 .<-->N
The Security Council attempted to evoke chapter VII sanctions from the United Nations Charter to intervene and prevent genocide in Syria .<-->N
But the vetoes by China and Russia halted any international intervention .<-->N
Since the Syrian Civil War began , an estimated 60,000 civilians have been killed , with thousands more displaced .<-->N
Srebrenica Massacre This 1995 Bosnian War massacre was the single worst act of mass murder on European soil since World War II .<-->O
After an ethnic cleansing campaign led by the Serbs targeted the Bosniaks , a largely Muslim community , the United Nations designated Srebrenica a safe-zone in 1993 .<-->N
Militarized units in the zone were forced to disarm , and a peacekeeping force was put in place , consisting of six hundred Dutch soldiers .<-->N
The Serbs then surrounded the safe-zone with tanks , soldiers , and artillery pieces .<-->N
With the zone surrounded , supply lines were slow-moving at best .<-->N
The UN forces were running low on ammunition , fuel , and food , as the Serbs continued to build an army around Srebrenica .<-->N
In July , Serbian forces invaded the area , forcing the small UN team back .<-->N
As many as 20,000 Bosniak refugees fled to the UN compound in Potocari , seeking protection from the advancing Serbs .<-->N
Despite the UN peacekeeping force present , Serbian soldiers entered the camp , raping Bosniak women and murdering freely while the Dutch peacekeepers did nothing .<-->N
By July 18th , 7,800 Bosniaks were dead , due largely to an ill-equipped and unprepared UN force .<-->O
Khmer Rouge Ruling Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 , the Khmer Rouge practiced an extreme form of Communism , as dictated by their borderline-psychotic leader Pol Pot .<-->N
Any suspected enemies were executed , including professionals and intellectuals .<-->N
Ethnic Vietnamese , Ethnic Chinese , and Christians were executed en masse .<-->N
In 1979 , the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia to oust the Khmer Rouge and end the massacre .<-->N
Pol Pot was forced in exile , and a new government was put in place in Cambodia .<-->N
Shockingly , the United Nations refused to recognize this new government because it was backed by Vietnam , which had recently ended a decade-long conflict with the United States .<-->N
Until 1994 , the United Nations recognized the Khmer Rouge as the true government of Cambodia , despite the fact that they had killed 2.5 million Cambodians , amounting to 33 % of their total population .<-->O
The Cold War The Cold War exemplifies the failure behind the United Nations Charter .<-->N
With the atrocities of World War II still fresh in their minds , the original founders aimed to foster human rights for all citizens of the world .<-->O
In 1948 , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -LRB- UDHR -RRB- was established , which was binding to all nations , along with the Convention Against Genocide .<-->N
Almost immediately , the USSR disregarded these .<-->N
Civic rights were virtually non-existent .<-->N
Stalin continued to rule with an iron fist , silencing all opponents .<-->N
In numerous Soviet Bloc nations , uprisings demanding the rights established in the UDHR were crushed with force .<-->O
With the United Nations unwilling to act upon such atrocities , the words in the charter were rendered meaningless for those who needed them the most Darfur In 2003 , the unstable nation of Sudan erupted in conflict , as various militia groups criticized and attacked the government for oppressing non-Arabs .<-->O
Early in the war , rebel forces defeated the Sudanese military in more than thirty battles .<-->N
Seeing that defeat was imminent , the government funded the Janjaweed , a group of Arab militants .<-->O
By 2005 , the Janjaweed were carrying out attacks on populated villages using artillery and helicopters , prompting condemnation by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .<-->N
Despite this condemnation , the UN did not enter Sudan , instead urging members of the African Union to intervene .<-->N
As the African Union attempted an intervention , it became apparent that the Sudanese military was destroying civilian populations .<-->N
Reports emerged revealing that Sudanese military planes were painted white , to resemble UN humanitarian aircraft , only to drop bombs on villages .<-->N
It was not until 2006 that 200 UN soldiers were dispatched to the area .<-->N
Despite their limited presence , fighting continued until 2010 .<-->F
In seven years , an estimated 300,000 Sudanese civilians were killed .<-->N
---------- The United Nations has failed miserably February 20 , 2009 As is the case always , the United Nations Organisation has failed miserably in its duties to protect civilians in a conflict .<-->O
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Thursday she was deeply concerned by reports of the rapidly deteriorating conditions facing a quarter of a million civilians trapped in the conflict zone in northern Sri Lanka , and of alleged human rights abuses and a significant number of civilian casualties , as well as the huge displacement .<-->O
Pillay also expressed concern at the highly restricted access to the Vanni region for aid agencies and impartial outside observers , including journalists and human rights monitors .<-->O
The perilous situation of civilians after many months of fighting , multiple displacements and heavy rains and flooding is extremely worrying , Pillay said .<-->O
The lack of access for independent monitors , humanitarian workers and the media only adds to concerns that the situation may be even worse than we realize , she added .<-->O
The war in Sri Lanka is unlike any other conflict .<-->N
It a war that is waged by the Government of Sri Lanka -LRB- GoSL -RRB- on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- with absolutely no regard for international humanitarian law or the civilian casualties that have reached more than 2000 dead and 5000 injured since the beginning of 2009 , according to a report by Human Rights Watch .<-->O
-LRB- Read this BBC article titled civilian slaughter in Sri Lanka . -RRB-<-->N
That the government has absolutely no concern for the civilians that it claims as its citizens should be clear from the fact that reporters are not allowed anywhere near the war zone .<-->O
Journalists who dare to question the barbaric conduct of the government are either brutally murdered or assaulted severely by government sponsored thugs .<-->O
Sri Lanka is the second most dangerous place in the world for journalists and several have been killed or injured at the hands of government sponsored death squads .<-->O
The Paris-based Reporters Sans Fronti res -LRB- RSF -RRB- has condemned the killings of journalists as a war crime .<-->N
All international agencies , including the Red Cross , have been ordered out of the zone in order to cover the fact that hundreds of civilians are being killed everday in indescriminate aerial bombardment and the use of cluster munitions and lethal fire bombs on civilians and even hospitals .<-->O
For the GoSL anything in the war zone is a legitimate target , including hospitals .<-->N
The notorious Defence Secretary , Gothabaya Rajapaksa has shamelessly stated the same .<-->O
It s not as if the injured and the dying are taken care of in well equipped hospitals .<-->O
Far from that .<-->N
The hospitals are merely first aid stations that are functioning in temporary structures without any equipment or adequate supplies .<-->N
They are overwhelmed by hundreds of injured patients , most of them women , children and the elderly .<-->N
Only a handful of doctors and paramedical staff are available and they are doing a heroic job of helping the injured under continuous threat to their own lives because of artillery shelling and aerial bombardment .<-->O
Medicines , food and relief supplies are deliberately blocked from reaching the affected civilians by the Sri Lankan forces .<-->O
International governments do not care about the fate of civilians because the Sri Lankan government is conducting this barbaric war with their full assistance and knowledge so they would are either busy supporting the atrocities of the GoSL or are maintaining a deafening silence .<-->O
The few who dare to speak out against the rising civilian casualties or about human rights violations , like the German and Swiss Ambassadors and a few international journalists and NGOs and relief agencies are threatened with dire consequences by the government .<-->O
The United Nations and its affiliates have disgraced themselves by watching this carnage without doing anything to help civilians or prevent the gross abuse of human rights violations , like the regime detaining displaced civilians forcibly in Nazi-style concentration camps , fenced by barbed wire without access to humanitarian workers or independent monitors .<-->O
Mere statements of deep concern are of no use !<-->O
What are these organisations for ?<-->N
Just to express concern and then compile a horrendous death toll after the killings are over ?<-->O
That s precisely what they did during the genocide in Rwanda .<-->N
While there can be absolutely no doubt that the UN as an institution is a miserable failure as far as maintaining world peace is concerned , just like its defunct predecessor , the League of Nations , different UN agencies have had some success on the field , especially in terms of humanitarian work and the care of refugees .<-->O
Sadly , even that is not applicable in this case .<-->N
Ban Ki-Moon and his gang are merely the world s best known bureaucrats who receive the highest pay among bureaucrats in the world just to make a few meaningless statements since they are not backed by action .<-->O
Shame on them all !<-->N
------------------ Moral relativism In 2004 , former ambassador to the UN Dore Gold published a book called Tower of Babble : How the United Nations Has Fueled Global Chaos .<-->N
The book criticized what it called the organization 's moral relativism in the face of -LRB- and occasional support of -RRB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- genocide and terrorism that occurred between the moral clarity of its founding period and the present day .<-->O
While the UN during its founding period was limited to those countries that declared war on at least one of the Axis powers of World War II , and thus were capable of taking a stand against evil , the modern United Nations has , according to Gold , become diluted to the point where only 75 of the 184 member states during the time of the book 's publication `` were free democracies , according to Freedom House . ''<-->O
-LSB- 2 -RSB- He further claimed that this had the effect of tipping the scales of the UN so that the organization as a whole was more amenable to the requirements of dictatorships .<-->O
-LSB- 2 -RSB- The UN General Assembly decided to hold a moment of silence in honor of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il following his death in 2011 .<-->O
Western diplomats criticized the decision .<-->N
`` An official at the Czech Republic 's UN mission said the Czechs did not request a similar moment of silence for V clav Havel , the playwright-turned-dissident who died '' a day after Kim .<-->N
-LSB- 3 -RSB- Allegations of globalismThere have been controversy and criticism of the UN organization and its activities since at least the 1950s .<-->O
In the United States , an early opponent of the UN was the John Birch Society , which began a `` get US out of the UN '' campaign in 1959 , charging that the UN 's aim was to establish a `` One World Government . ''<-->N
Charles de Gaulle of France criticized the UN , famously calling it le machin -LRB- `` the thingamabob '' -RRB- , and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help in maintaining world peace , preferring that the UN direct defense treaties between countries .<-->O
-LSB- 4 -RSB- Debates surrounding population control and abortionThe United Nations Population Fund has been accused by different groups -LSB- who ? -RSB-<-->N
of providing support for government programs which have promoted forced-abortions and coercive sterilizations .<-->O
Controversies regarding these allegations have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and the United States government , with three presidential administrations , that of Ronald Reagan , George H. Bush and George W. Bush withholding funding from the UNFPA .<-->N
The UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's population control program in the mid-to-late '90s , when it was discovered the Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations .<-->N
The UNFPA was not found directly involved in the scandal , but continued to fund and work with the population control program after the abuses had become public .<-->N
-LSB- 5 -RSB- The issue played a role in the Bush administration 's decision in 2002 to cut off funding for the organization .<-->N
-LSB- 6 -RSB- --------------- Why The United Nations is a Useless Failure The main purpose for the United Nations -LRB- U.N. -RRB- is to resolve issues between countries through diplomacy before countries resort to military force and before conflicts escalate .<-->O
Unfortunately , the U.N. has consistently failed this goal and will continue being useless for these several reasons .<-->N
First , the United Nations is primarily a forum for debate .<-->N
As a result , the U.N. is an international organization where countries send representatives to argue for or against issues .<-->N
These representatives are typically just spokesmen for their country 's agendas and are relatively powerless in their own country .<-->O
Furthermore , countries governed by non-peaceful dictators and regimes typically use these debates to delay and obfuscate issues in their favor .<-->N
Over the fifty years that the United Nations has existed , these debates alone have not resolved a single issue .<-->N
Direct military actions , back room negotiations , and threats , that were not sponsored by the United Nations , have had the only real positive affects for change .<-->O
For instance , Iraq was under U.N. backed economic trade sanctions for over a decade .<-->N
As a result , the Iraqi people suffered greatly while Saddam Hussein continued playing games with the United Nations by only periodically allowing inspections for weapons of mass destruction , inconsistent disarmament of known weapons , and illegally finding ways around the oil for food agreements that the U.N. imposed .<-->O
As a result , economic sanctions were an abyssal failure .<-->N
Only the United States of America had the courage of breaking this stalemate that had the Iraqi people caught in the middle .<-->O
Yet again , the United Nations is considering this same solution that has never worked to be used against North Korea because of its nuclear weapons program and testing .<-->N
And Iran is keeping a close eye on what the world does to North Korea , since Iran has similar nuclear ambitions for their non-peaceful agenda too .<-->N
Second , the United Nations is unable to take direct and independent actions without support from its members .<-->O
In other words , the U.N. is completely powerless and pacifistic .<-->N
In a world filled with war-mongering dictators and suppressing regimes who know the U.N. lacks any real power , regimes are almost completely free to do whatever they want .<-->O
For example , North Korea has tested nuclear weapons and threatens to do so again , with the United Nations only considering sanctions .<-->N
The only solution that I can imagine is for each country that is a member of the United Nations to equally contribute a military force or equivalent money to the United Nations .<-->N
And the United Nations could use these resources without approval from any individual country .<-->N
As you can imagine , this is not likely going to ever happen .<-->N
Third , the United Nations has five nations that can veto any resolution that the majority of the U.N. members agreed upon .<-->N
The countries with this veto power are China , France , Russia -LRB- formerly the Soviet Union -RRB- , the United Kingdom , and the United States of America .<-->N
These countries have this power because they were the founding countries of the United Nations that wrote the rules for the U.N. after World War 2 .<-->N
Unfortunately , this non-democracy fails for several reasons .<-->N
First , only a true democracy among nations is unbiased and fair .<-->O
Thus , the complete structure of the U.N. needs a major overhaul .<-->O
This too is not likely to happen , since the countries with vetoing power are unlikely to unanimously agree to give up this right for fairness sake .<-->O
Additionally , since a lot of the countries in the United Nations are not for peace , these nations have very questionable voting practices .<-->O
The only possible solution is to deny voting rights for non-peace loving nations .<-->O
This includes any non-free and non-democratic country who would be biased towards dictators and regimes .<-->N
I do not think that the U.N. is capable of only allowing free countries the right to vote .<-->O
This is contradictory to the purpose of the United Nations , since nations would only debate in the forum of the United Nations if they can vote in the Security Council of the U.N. Similarly , the United Nations prides itself as an international humanitarian group , yet allows non-humanitarian members , such as China , to continue having voting rights on humanitarian issues , even though these countries greatly suppress and ignore the humanitarian rights of their own people too .<-->O
This would further reduce the number of members capable of voting .<-->O
Again , this is not likely to happen .<-->N
The fourth and final reason why the United Nations is useless is terrorism .<-->O
The U.N. does not formally recognize any country as a terrorist state .<-->N
Furthermore , terrorists are not interested in the politics of debating in a public forum , such as the United Nations , to discuss and work out their issues .<-->N
Therefore , the U.N. does not get involved in politics with terrorist groups .<-->N
As a result , the United Nations is completely blind to terrorist groups , has no plans of address terrorism , and has no intentions of changing .<-->O
The fact that the United Nations , as the largest international organization that promotes peace , is completely unable to address terrorism is further proof that the U.N. is ineffective .<-->O
In conclusion , the United Nations has proven itself as a failure for its entire history and will continue being useless .<-->O
Maybe if peaceful countries withdraw their membership and stop participating in the United Nations in protest , will force the United Nations to abandon its old methods of dealing with non-peaceful and non-humanitarian nations .<-->O
Should the criminal justice system focus more on rehabilitation than retribution ?<-->O
Rehabilitation or retribution My husband was arrested for a DUI in 2005 .<-->N
He was on probation for another DUI when it happened .<-->F
He was incarcerated for 3 yrs .<-->N
Which turned the lives of his wife and children completely upside down .<-->O
While he was in prison , he became addicted to heroine which is easily obtained in the prison .<-->O
He came out worse than he was when he went in .<-->N
Now he is incarcerated again on a different drug offense .<-->N
We finally divorced this year in January 2013 .<-->N
We had a great marriage and he was a wonderful man until he went to prison and became hooked on the drugs .<-->O
If he had been sent to a rehabilitation facility where they focus on alcoholism instead of a prison where inmates can readily get drugs , this may have changed this family of four which is now a family of three .<-->O
My now x-husband suffered but so did his wife and three children .<-->N
It is 8 years later and we still have n't put the pieces of our lives together .<-->N
We lost our home , the rest of his family disowned not only him but our whole family .<-->N
It hurts me so much but what 's worse is how it hurts my children !<-->O
They were so innocent , ages 3 , 10 , & 12 which makes this such a tragedy !<-->O
I strongly hope this will be taken into consideration when deciding on sentences for alcohol and drug offenders .<-->O
They need rehabilitation , not prison !<-->O
If he would have had that , we would probably all be the family we weredefinition of criminal justice system criminal justice system : a series of organizations involved in apprehending , prosecuting , defending , sentencing , and jailing those involved in crimes - including law enforcement , attorneys , judges , courts of law , prisons '' nowhere in this definition does it give the criminal justice system the choice of sending people to a rehabilitation center so if they dont have the choice than rehabilitation shouldnt be used also i have proof that rehabilitation doesnt work but is just a way for the U.S. to spend more money Crime Gene What about people who have the crime gene .<-->O
Let 's face it ... it exists .<-->N
There are criminals out there and maybe they come from a line of criminals .<-->N
If they have this crime gene in them , which most of them probably do .<-->N
then there is no way to rehabilitate them .<-->N
It 's in their genes .<-->N
The only way to get rid of it is to breed it out of them .<-->N
And that 's just wrong .<-->O
The criminal justice system should put more focus on rehabilitation than retribution .<-->O
Time and time again , logic and statistics prove rehabilitation to be more effective than retribution .<-->O
Take Norway , for example .<-->N
They value rehabilitation very highly , have abolished the death penalty , and have stopped sentencing criminals to life in prison .<-->O
Now , while some may let their emotions get in the way and complain about murderers freely walking the streets , let 's take a look at Norway 's impressive track record .<-->O
Only a 20 % recidivism rate , compared to the 65 % US rate , some of the lowest murder records in the world , and reasonably low prison populations .<-->O
Rehabilitation is a system that works , whether we like it or not .<-->N
Once a criminal , always a criminal .<-->N
My younger was molested by our grandfather who swore he would kill her if she said anything .<-->O
Well she did say something and did he go to jail ?<-->N
The court declared him mentally ill and sent him to a hospital .<-->N
He was in the hospital for about 4 months when he was finally released .<-->N
He found my sister when he got out ... .<-->N
If he would have been imprisoned like the rapist he was , my sister would still be alive .<-->O
They are people .<-->N
Criminals are people too .<-->N
They deserve a second chance , but only if they admit they messed up , and are ready to go into the world again .<-->O
A life sentence is wrong on every level , unless they deserve it then they should n't be in there for long .<-->O
Give them a chance .<-->N
You should punish criminals I believe that criminals should be punished , because of their fragile mental state they need to be kept under control .<-->O
I agree with the point saying that if the government pushed rehabilitation over correction potential criminals might think that acting violently is okay .<-->O
Mass murders destroy the life of a lot of people with little to no sympathy , that is not right .<-->O
We need to provide mandatory rehabilitation facilities .<-->O
Imprison the serious violent offenders such as rapists , murderers , pedophiles and rehabilitate the drug offenders .<-->O
Our Justice System is failing and not doing enough to rehabilitate , basically causing the issue of repeat offenders .<-->O
We have a society that is suffering from lack of parental supervision , poverty , low-education , and gang related communities .<-->O
Many of today 's generation has no moral education which results in delinquency then turns into an adult-repeat offender because they do not know any different way to live .<-->O
We need to stop throwing the key away and start developing rehabilitation units that are mandatory and provide many beneficial programs to help teach these `` lost offenders '' how to depend on themselves and not the system or the criminal life of an offender .<-->O
Retribution deters crime A retributive justice system deters crime by giving potential criminals a good reason not to commit crime .<-->O
Focusing on rehabilitation would send the message that we are going easy on crime , reducing the effect of deterrence .<-->O
In a study done by the National Center for Policy Analysis it was found that `` 15 crimes are eliminated for each additional prisoner locked up . ''<-->N
If this is n't a good reason to stay retributive , I do n't know what is .<-->O
Another wrong does not make a right I am not religious but i think the old xtian proverb `` if not for the grace of god there go I. . . '' .<-->O
What that means in secular terms is that if any of us were in a desperate situation we may be compelled to do a criminal act .<-->N
Yes violent offenders should be segregated from society for public safety .<-->N
But even violent criminals can be rehabilitated .<-->N
The US is in the minority in the world justice systems that has long sentences for non violent crime , life imprisonment or death for violence that ends anothers life .<-->O
Murder is a horrible thing .<-->N
However in prison systems that concentrate on rehabilitation and do not have solitary confinement , there is a lower recidivism rate .<-->N
Personally , god forbid , if I had to stay in an american prison for even just ten years I 'd rather be given my last meal , cigarette , my last words , and be put in front of firing squad .<-->O
Taking away a persons humanity and respect can only do a few things to them .<-->O
It may punish them a little but it will mostly make them mad .<-->O
There is only so much a person can take before they become mad at the world .<-->O
Them being mad at the world will cause them to mostly attack society again .<-->O
Having a retributive criminal justice system since the 1970s has led to nearly 65 % of all people who are released from jail or prison to return within the first five years .<-->O
Rehabilitation Is Motivation I believe that rehabilitation should be offered and depend on the severity of the crime committed .<-->O
Many individuals who are in prison for many years do not want to be there anymore and programs to help them succeed as a fellow citizen out in the public will and have motivated inmates to not want to re-offend .<-->O
Being in prison a long time can have an affect on an individual , whether positive or negative , but from personal experience of a family member being incarcerated for 10-15 years and seeing them regain strength in society opened my eyes that not everyone who has committed a violent crime should be put to death or serve unusually long sentences like life in prison .<-->O
I 'm not saying that rehabilitation works for everyone , but it is in my eyes definitely more humane , then just letting someone rot in prison , especially for a petty crime .<-->O
Rehabilitation programs offer the guidance and a responsibility to themselves that individual may not of been able to learn from anywhere else and it just might be what that person needed to jump start their lives .<-->O
I 've seen many people who had a prison life at one time who are successful individuals today , and with experiences like they 've had , it gives them more of a positive influence if they choose to work with troubled individuals themselves because they 've been there .<-->O
People like that are the best example that it is indeed possible to turn your life around for the positive , some just need that extra push .<-->O
-------------------------------------------- Rwanda : Should the Criminal Justice System Focus More On Rehabilitation ?<-->N
-LRB- Do n't Punish Them , Reform Them -RRB- By focusing more on rehabilitation than retribution , the criminal justice system will do more than just put away criminals .<-->O
Rehabilitation makes it possible to identify the factors that could have led to them being deviants .<-->N
Rehabilitation sees to it that the chances of them repeating the crime are minimised .<-->N
It is by rehabilitation that the reintegration of offenders back into the society is made possible since it is testimony that society has not lost hope on the said offender .<-->O
It places such great value on the prisoner 's rights that it tries so hard to change the offender and prevent his re-offending .<-->O
------------ The answer to this question depends on who you ask .<-->N
Some people will say that the justice system should focus on rehabilitation while others say it should focus more on deterrence .<-->O
If you do n't know , deterrence is basically to prevent other people from committing crime which focuses more on greater punishments .<-->O
My personal opinion is that the justice system should n't focus more on either one of these .<-->O
Instead there needs to be a balance between the two .<-->N
--------------- Transcript of criminal justice should focus more on rehabilitation .<-->O
Criminal Justice should focus more on rehabilitation .<-->N
Background info The criminal justice system comprises many distinct stages , including arrest , prosecution , trial , sentencing , and punishment -LRB- quite often in the form of imprisonment -RRB- .<-->O
Rehabilitation can take place in any of these phases as the police for example can impose on the spot penalties and cautions but these are not controversial it is in the last two of these many stages that there is debate over whether the criminal justice system should focus more on rehabilitation than on retribution .<-->O
Pro Rehabilitation is the most valuable ideological justification for imprisonment , for it alone promotes the humanising belief in the notion that offenders can be saved and not simply punished .<-->O
Desert -LRB- retributive -RRB- theory , on the other hand , sees punishment as an end in itself , in other words , punishment for punishment s sake .<-->N
This has no place in any enlightened society .<-->F
An example can be taken from the aftermath of the London rioters , where 170 riot offenders under 18 are now in custody without firstly understanding the causes of the riots nor the reasons of why these people offended .<-->N
-LSB- 1 -RSB- Pro The rehabilitative ideal does not ignore society and the victim .<-->N
In fact it is because retribution places such great value on the prisoner s rights that it tries so hard to change the offender and prevent his reoffending .<-->O
By seeking to reduce reoffending and to reduce crime , it seeks constructively to promote the safety of the public , and to protect individuals from the victimisation of crime .<-->O
The public agrees ; a 2008 poll of British citizens found 82 % thought rehabilitation was as important , or more important than punishment as a criterion when sentencing criminals .<-->O
-LSB- 2 -RSB- Pro While some rehabilitative programmes work with some offenders -LRB- those who would probably change by themselves anyway -RRB- , most do not .<-->O
Many programs can not overcome , or even appreciably reduce , the powerful tendency for offenders to continue in criminal behaviour .<-->O
In Britain , where rehabilitation has long been purported to stop re-offending , 58 per cent of those over-21 find themselves in trouble with the law within two years of release .<-->O
-LSB- 1 -RSB- Pro Background info Rehabilitation is the idea of reforming a prisoner so that they can reintegrate back into society upon their release .<-->O
This process involves various programs including anger management , education programs and even creative workshops to form another outlet for expression .<-->O
It is hoped that through this process they will become less inclined to commit crimes in the future .<-->O
It seeks to prevent a person from reoffending by taking away the desire to offend .<-->O
This is very different from the idea of deterrence -LRB- which is the idea of making him afraid to offend , though he may still desire to -RRB- , and the idea of incapacitation -LRB- which is the idea of taking away his physical power to offend , though he may still desire to and be unafraid to -RRB- however even under these theories the assumption is that after the offender has spent their time they will be much less of a threat to society , can be released and will not reoffend .<-->O
Con A sanction should not merely be helpful it should treat the offending conduct as wrong .<-->O
The purpose of punishment is to show disapproval for the offender s wrongdoing , and to clearly condemn his criminal actions .<-->O
This is what was and is being done with the offenders of the August riots , the most common example is of an the two men who attempted to organise riots using Facebook , both were sentenced to four years and shows societies disgust in the events of the riots and acts as a message for future .<-->N
-LSB- 1 -RSB- Con Why is justice and censure -LRB- retribution -RRB- so important ?<-->O
Because unless the criminal justice system responds to persons who have violated society s rules by communicating , through punishment , the censure of that offending conduct , the system will fail to show society that it takes its own rules -LRB- and the breach of them -RRB- seriously .<-->O
There are other important reasons as well : such as to convey to victims the acknowledgement that they have been wronged .<-->O
Punishment , in other words , may be justified by the aim of achieving justice and desert , and not by the aim of rehabilitation .<-->O
Con If we had the opportunity to stop some offenders re-offending why do we not seize this opportunity ?<-->O
Rehabilitative programs provide such an opportunity .<-->N
Such programs include cognitive-behavioural programs -LRB- say , trying to get a violent offender to think and reach differently to potential trigger situations -RRB- , pro-social modelling programmes , and some sex-offender treatment programs .<-->O
Of course , certain styles will suit some better than others , but this is someone that will have to determined case by case .<-->O
As some methods with work better than others depending on attitudes , values etc. .<-->O
The rehabilitation programs simply do not work .<-->N
Rehabilitation is therefore a false promise and the danger with such an illusory and impossible goal is that it is used as a front to justify keeping offenders locked up for longer than they deserve and sometimes even indefinitely -LRB- if we keep him here longer maybe he might change -RRB- .<-->O
We can not justify passing any heavier or more onerous a sentence on a person in the name of rehabilitation if rehabilitation does not work .<-->O
Con The most credible research -LRB- done by a technique called meta-analysis -RRB- demonstrates that the net effect of treatment is , on average , a positive reduction of overall recidivism -LRB- reoffending -RRB- rates of between 10 % and 12 % , which would promote a reduction in crime that is , by criminal standards , massive .<-->O
Pro Con The question does it work must be joined by the second question : even if it does work , how can you tell , with each individual offender , when it has worked ?<-->N
How would we check if this system is really working ?<-->N
Tagging prisoners ?<-->N
Free counselling for the prisoner for the rest of their life ?<-->N
These measures would require huge administration costs and then the question follows would it even be feasible to enforce such a system ?<-->O
The expense of re-offenders re-entering the system is also an expense that our prison system can not afford .<-->N
A system such as counselling for released prisoners would prove to be inexpensive when weighed against the benefits of decreased crime , and all the costs involved in that -LRB- public damage , judicial costs and prison costs -RRB- .<-->O
Given that many organisations work in rehabilitation programs in prisons for very little , if any , payment such a system could easily be established for counselling ----------------- You can not make a blanket statement on the choice , some people are career criminals and have no interest in Rehab , there are some where a combination of the two would be appropriate and there are some people who benefit from Rehabilitation .<-->O
You have a typical opinion on this one .<-->N
Have you ever been locked up ?<-->N
Have you ever been falsely accused ?<-->N
Any given statute that prescribes a departmental function , creates an obligation , or prescribes a penalty , must be implemented by regulations published in the Federal Register .<-->O
The requirement is in the Federal Register Act , at 44 U.S.C. 1505 -LRB- a -RRB- .<-->N
Definition of a crime is '' ... all offenses against the laws of the United States . ''<-->O
However , the controlling statute for criminal jurisdiction is Title 18 USC 3231 , which only mentions the district court of the United States -LRB- DCUS -RRB- as having exclusive jurisdiction .<-->O
But , Citizens are prosecuted in United States District Courts -LRB- USDC -RRB- , of which such authority has never been documented .<-->N
Yes , our entire US criminal industry is essentially based upon FRAUD , deception , and conspiracy .<-->O
This is FACT not opinion .<-->N
If you do your research you will find that it is the same 4 % that keeps re-offending .<-->N
It is that small number which keeps 90 % of the industry going .<-->N
The enforcers do not want to give up that job security .<-->N
Crime in American now cost over $ 675 billion annually with much of that cost going to lawyers .<-->N
This translates into four times the cost of the Iraq war , including 9/11 and ending 2006 .<-->N
So there is an economic benefit to lawyers to leave the broken criminal justice system in place , just the way it is .<-->O
The most factual portrayal of crime in America and the criminal justice system is featured in the book `` Homegrown Terrorism , The Undeclared War Against Crime In America '' , American Trend Publishing , Sammy Sorrell author .<-->O
Write your opinionated narrow-minded paper , and Americans can send you and your associates the bill !<-->N
---------------------------- Which is a better general justifying aim for punishment ?<-->N
\ Rehabilitation is the most valuable ideol ... Which is a better general justifying aim for punishment ?<-->O
Rehabilitation is the most valuable ideological justification for punishment , for it alone promotes the humanising belief in the notion that offenders can be saved and not simply punished .<-->O
The rehabilitative ideal alone conveys the message that the state has an obligation to help those who fall short of the standards of behaviour it has set .<-->O
These people are often those with the greatest social disadvantages that have constrained them to a life in crime in the first place .<-->N
Desert -LRB- retributive -RRB- theory , on the other hand , sees punishment as an end in itself , in other words , punishment for punishment s sake .<-->N
This has no place in any enlightened society .<-->N
The rehabilitative ideal does not ignore society and the victim .<-->N
In fact it is because it places such great value on their rights that it tries so hard to change the offender and prevent his reoffending .<-->O
By seeking to reducing reoffending and to reduce crime , it seeks constructively to promote society s right to safety , and to protect individuals from the victimisation of crime .<-->O
Which is a better general justifying aim for punishment ?<-->N
A sanction should not merely be helpful it should treat the offending conduct as wrong .<-->O
The purpose of punishment is to show disapproval for the offender s wrongdoing , and to clearly condemn his criminal actions .<-->O
This is why we punish ; we punish to censure -LRB- retribution -RRB- , we do not punish merely to help a person change for the better -LRB- rehabilitation -RRB- .<-->O
We still have to punish a robber or a murderer , even if he is truly sorry and even if he would really , really never offend again and even if we could somehow tell that for certain .<-->O
This is because justice , and not rehabilitation , makes sense as the justification for punishment .<-->O
Why is justice and censure -LRB- retribution -RRB- so important ?<-->O
Because unless the criminal justice system responds to persons who have violated society s rules by communicating , through punishment , the censure of that offending conduct , the system will fail to show society that it takes its own rules -LRB- and the breach of them -RRB- seriously .<-->O

Which approach has greater regard for the offender ?<-->N
\ Rehabilitation has another important value i. . .<-->N
Which approach has greater regard for the offender ?<-->N
Rehabilitation has another important value it recognises the reality of social inequity .<-->N
To say that some offenders need help to be rehabilitated is to accept the idea that circumstances can constrain , if not compel , and lead to criminality ; it admits that we can help unfortunate persons who have been overcome by their circumstance .<-->O
It rejects the idea that individuals , regardless of their position in the social order , exercise equal freedom in deciding whether to commit a crime , and should be punished equally according to their offence , irrespective of their social backgrounds .<-->O
Policies that ignore these realities foster hardships that will fall primarily and disproportionately on the already disadvantaged , and deepen the resentment that many inmates find difficult to suppress upon their release back into such a society .<-->O
Which approach has greater regard for the offender ?<-->N
Crime is not pathology , it is not the product of circumstance , and it is certainly not the product of coincidence .<-->N
It is the result of choices made by the individual , and therefore the justice system must condemn those choices when they violate society s rules .<-->O
To say otherwise -LRB- i.e. to say that criminals are merely the product of their unfortunate circumstances -RRB- would be an insult to ideas of free will , human autonomy and individual choice it would be to deny the possibility of human actors making good decisions in the face of hardship .<-->O
Retributivism alone best recognises the offender s status as a moral agent , by asking that he take responsibility for what he has done , rather than to make excuses for it .<-->O
It appeals to an inherent sense of right and wrong , and in this way is the most respectful to humanity because it recognises that persons are indeed fundamentally capable of moral deliberation , no matter what their personal circumstances are .<-->O
Which is a better basis for determining sentencing ?<-->N
\ As a guide to the sentencing decisions of judg ... Which is a better basis for determining sentencing ?<-->N
As a guide to the sentencing decisions of judges , having rehabilitation as a goal provides the most flexible and sensible direction .<-->O
With rehabilitation as a guide sentencers can give a penitent offender , or an offender who has learnt from his mistakes -LRB- i.e. a self-rehabilitated offender -RRB- , the chance to receive a lighter sentence .<-->O
On the other hand it can give offenders a different or tougher sentence to help them reform , if they are less likely to reform .<-->O
Retribution , by contrast , merely advocates an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth .<-->N
This simplistic notion of vengeance is primitive if not barbaric , and should not be encouraged in society .<-->O
Which is a better basis for determining sentencing ?<-->N
Retributivism advocates that more serious crimes should be punished more seriously , because the more severe the violation of our rules , the greater the censure that is needed .<-->O
It means that if X , a pickpocket , would get punishment A , then Y , a robber who uses force and then rapes his victim should get a proportionately more severe punishment , punishment B .<-->O
The idea is proportionality , not equivalence nobody is suggesting we should rob Y and then rape him to pay him back .<-->O
It is thus very different from the idea of an an eye for an eye .<-->O
What matters is merely that more serious crimes are treated proportionately more seriously .<-->O
Punishment A may one month s probation while B may be 10 years imprisonment .<-->N
By contrast , under a rehabilitative model where the goal was the reformation of the offender , the pickpocket may well get 10 years imprisonment if he looks like he is not going to reform , while the robber-rapist may get one month s probation if he is repentant a result that is surely ridiculous .<-->O
When it comes to deciding the quantum of punishment , proportionality -LRB- retributivism -RRB- is the only consistent and fair approach Does rehabilitation actually work ?<-->O
\ If we could find a medicine that would cure some offenders so ... Does rehabilitation actually work ?<-->O
If we could find a medicine that would cure some offenders so they would never offend again , would we really not want it ?<-->O
Even if it only worked for some people , is that not still worthwhile ?<-->N
It is no different with rehabilitative programs we should certainly support them if they can be shown to work .<-->O
And indeed , the most recent studies show that they do .<-->O
Such programs include cognitive-behavioural programs -LRB- say , trying to get a violent offender to think and react differently to potential trigger situations -RRB- , pro-social modelling programmes , and some sex-offender treatment programs .<-->O
The most credible research -LRB- done by a technique called meta-analysis -RRB- demonstrates that the net effect of treatment is , on average , a positive reduction of overall recidivism -LRB- reoffending -RRB- rates of between 10 % and 12 % , which would promote a reduction in crime that is , by penological standards , massive -LSB- see resources above -RSB- Does rehabilitation actually work ?<-->O
While some rehabilitative programmes work with some offenders -LRB- those who would probably change by themselves anyway -RRB- , most do not .<-->O
Many programs can not overcome , or even appreciably reduce , the powerful tendency for offenders to continue in criminal behaviour .<-->O
They simply do not work .<-->N
Rehabilitation is therefore a false promise and the danger with such an illusory and impossible goal is that it is used as a front to justify keeping offenders locked up for longer than they deserve and sometimes even indefinitely -LRB- if we keep him here longer maybe he might change -RRB- .<-->O
We can not justify passing any heavier or more onerous a sentence on a person in the name of rehabilitation if rehabilitation does not work .<-->O
The question does it work ?<-->N
must be joined by a second question : even if it does work , how can you tell , with each individual offender , when it has worked ?<-->N
This provides further problems with subscribing to the rehabilitative ideal , argued below .<-->O
Imprisonment : A special consideration .<-->N
\ Rehabilitation is not only important when the court is deci ... Imprisonment : A special consideration .<-->O
Rehabilitation is not only important when the court is deciding on the sentence .<-->N
It is also important when it comes to actually carrying out the punishment .<-->N
This is perhaps the clearest with sentences of imprisonment .<-->N
The role of the criminal justice system does not end with the pronouncement of a sentence for what is to happen to the offender while he is serving his time in prison ?<-->O
Surely we should be trying to help him change : we should provide him with meaningful skills training , with behavioural-treatment programs , with counselling and so on .<-->O
In other words , we should be trying to rehabilitate him while he is in imprison -LRB- since he is going to be there anyway -RRB- , instead of just thinking that the job is done .<-->O
This rehabilitation also plays a role in determining the content of punishment and the shape that it takes .<-->O
Imprisonment : A special consideration The goal of rehabilitation is at its most dangerous when it is applied in the context of actually carrying out the punishment of imprisonment ; that is , when it is used as a criteria for release decisions .<-->O
For how can any prison staff , parole officer or even psychologist ever tell that a person has reformed or probably will not offend again ?<-->O
Evidence has shown that such vast discretion given to treatment staff , guided only by the grand ideal of rehabilitation , has systematically produced unfair , incorrect and even racially discriminatory results .<-->O
Indeed , on what basis can they make any fair , sensible decision ?<-->N
The sad answer is that , since one can never tell if an offender is cured , having rehabilitation as the goal forces the decision to be made be based on statistical risk factors like whether the person belongs to a racial group that is statistically likely to reoffend , or whether the person belongs to an economic underclass that makes him statistically likely to reoffend .<-->O
Of course all this does is to double-penalise the offender for something he can not help , such as his race or his poverty .<-->O
It also leads to what is sometimes called back-end sentencing : the offender is sentenced once in court , but in reality he is sentenced again out-of-court because the final date of his release depends entirely on parole officers or prison staff .<-->O
---------------------- Transcript of Should The Criminal Justice System Focus More On Rehabilitation What is Rehabilitation ?<-->N
Rehabilitation In Prisons Rehabilitation In Prisons The criminal justice system needs to focus more on rehabilitation rather than punishment in order to lower rates of recidivism and in order to allow inmate a better chance at transitioning back into the public because after paying their debt to society , it is important to give them chances to live a future which outshines their past .<-->O
Imagine this : a young man is 16 years old and has just been put into the juvenile detention system for a shoplifting charge .<-->O
He has just been sentenced to two years .<-->N
He pays his debt and in two years , he is released .<-->N
He is now 18 years old , jobless with no education , no one wants to hire him , and no one is willing to help him get his life back on track .<-->O
So , he turns to less than honest ways of making a living .<-->O
In less than a year he has returned to jail .<-->N
Two to four years later , he is released , and it starts all over again : no job , no help , back to jail .<-->N
Only this time he is not released .<-->N
It is now a life sentence with now chance of parole .<-->N
Many times , inmates leave prison hoping to better themselves The definition of rehabilitation is to restore to a condition of good health , ability to work , or the like .<-->O
What is the etcetera ?<-->N
Is it being at the wrong place at the wrong time ?<-->N
Is it being too young to think about the consequences ?<-->N
Is it making a mistake ?<-->N
The focus on rehabilitation was shaken mid-1970s Prisoners knew how to reintergrate `` Tough on Crime instead of Preventing Crime Lower recidivism rates Prisoners better themselves Better Chance at life Prisoners want to move forward The definition of punishment is a penalty inflicted for an offense , a fault , etc The system is not focused enough .<-->O
Money Could help Rehabilitation Programs What is the point of prison ?<-->O
With No help , it is a continual cycle of hopelessness Eventually , they will return to prison Many believe rehabilitation will not always work .<-->O
Everyone is not a lost cause It is not fair to deprive prisoners of help .<-->O
Think back to the young man mentioned before Do n't they deserve a second chance ?<-->N
A second chance used to mean something .<-->N
it is important to give them chances to live a future which outshines their past .<-->N
Instead of funding rehabilitation programs , there is funding for new prisons because of overflow .<-->N
Drug Rehabilitation Alcohol Anonymous Vocational Education Substance Abuse Education Faith Based Programs Recreation ----------------- The first key word is CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM which is the set of various actions such as arrest / sentencing / trial and prosecution that are undertaken in order to deliver justice to a plaintiff .<-->O
The next key word is REHABILITATION .<-->N
Though most people confuse the same with easygoing counseling , I would like to apprise you all that it is actually not the same .<-->O
The word has derived from two word re + habilitation .<-->N
While re means again , the word habilitate means to make good / to make fit .<-->N
Thus the word rehabilitation actually means to make good again .<-->O
In totality , it can be defined as the process of changing the outlook and even personality of a person , in order to make him fit for the society .<-->O
Finally , the word RETRIBUTION means inflicting pain on a person as a means of vengeance for his/her acts .<-->O
Now I would like to move on to my major arguments .<-->O
The first one is derived from the very definition of both these terms and compares their motives .<-->N
While rehabilitation is a means to facilitate the incorporation of criminals back to the society and ensure that they don t repeat their mistakes , retribution assumes itself to be an end .<-->O
It doesn t take into consideration the life of a criminal after he / she has served his/her sentence in the prison and its impact on the society .<-->O
This brings me to my second point of its impact on the society .<-->N
According to a psychological theory called the self concept , when a prisoner is subjected to harsh treatment and pain in a prison , it increases his/her urge to inflict the same pain back on the members of the society as a form of vengeance .<-->O
On the other hand rehabilitation as a process is complete , and ensures that the very desire of a criminal to commit crimes is eliminated .<-->O
At this point , most of the people may argue that the very logic attached to the concept of retribution is that the society wants to condemn a certain thing .<-->O
If a person commits a rape , he/she must be made to suffer in the prisons for a certain amount of time because of his actions .<-->O
However I would like to disagree to it by saying that even if such a perception is not barbaric , it certainly is primitive .<-->O
With time the society has realized that no person is a born criminal .<-->N
Rehabilitation believes that a person can turn a criminal into one in two ways : - 1 .<-->N
The CLASSICAL WAY - where his / her parents engage in such activities and he is exposed to them since his childhood .<-->O
This forces him to form a negative perception of society since childhood .<-->N
The MODELLING way - where he/she is exposed to various friends , celebrity heroes and others engaging in such acts .<-->O
This happens usually after the age of 13 .<-->N
Thus the approach of rehabilitation recognizes that all people in the society are not equal , and that a person is committing crime not to satisfy his / her soul , but because of certain psychological disorders .<-->O
At this point people may even have apprehensions regarding the efficacy of techniques such as rehabilitation .<-->O
Well the logic is quite simple .<-->N
If certain environmental circumstances can make any person a criminal , then certainly there are circumstances that can turn a criminal back to a socially fit member of the society .<-->O
With the introduction of new forms of technologies such as behavior changing drugs and psycho - cerebral surgeries it seems really foolish to question the efficacy of this technique .<-->O
Thus , I would like to conclude the debate by saying that the society today is evolving .<-->O
And the criminal justice system , being a part of the society , must evolve too .<-->O
It should recognize that criminals too are humans , because if we start believing in the policy of an eye for an eye - we must be prepared to live in a blind world .<-->O
Against the Motion by Swasti Nagpal As the opposition it becomes my prerogative to present the following constructive arguments against the motion .<-->O
My first argument , throws light on the relevance of fear from the law of the land .<-->O
The purpose of punishment is to show disapproval for the offender s wrongdoing , and to clearly condemn his criminal actions .<-->O
This is why we punish ; we punish to censure , we do not punish merely to help a person change for the better .<-->O
However , in the hope that during his course of punishment the latter will be accomplished .<-->O
This is primarily because we believe that people are indeed fundamentally capable of moral deliberation , no matter what their personal circumstances are .<-->O
When it comes to rehabilitation of prisoners the fear of a strict law and just criminal system emphasising on punishment is what will send the message across to prospective criminals that if they too indulge in any criminal wrongdoing they shall face the same fate .<-->O
The idea is to make prisons shit holes where you don t want people to go and not heavens where they would rather want to go .<-->O
If you make the law a lot more lenient you would indeed encouraging crime instead of curbing it .<-->O
My second argument puts forth a very pertinent question .<-->O
Who will determine , in case of rehabilitation , whether the person is reformed ?<-->N
And how is it practically possible to do so ?<-->O
The goal of rehabilitation is at its most dangerous when it is applied in the context when it is used as a criteria for release decisions .<-->O
For how can any prison staff , parole officer or even psychologist ever tell that a person has reformed or probably will not offend again ?<-->O
Surely we should be trying to help them change but not at the cost of easing the law and order .<-->O
Ladies and gentlemen a rotten mango can only harm the stomach and therefore to stay under a fallacy of change it would only be na ve .<-->O
It only makes sense to Mercy those who mercy others .<-->N
My last and final argument throws light on the stigma that surrounds us and the unwillingness of society to accept a released criminal , they will be subjected to bitter behaviour , cold shoulders and no jobs which will eventually force them to mend to their old ways .<-->O
For those who like it in black and white we live in a society where we follow the policy of once a criminal always a criminal .<-->O
------------------------- Rehabilitate or punish ?<-->N
It 's not a very good time to be a prisoner in the United States .<-->O
Incarceration is not meant to be fun , of course .<-->N
But a combination of strict sentencing guidelines , budget shortfalls and a punitive philosophy of corrections has made today 's prisons much more unpleasant -- and much less likely to rehabilitate their inhabitants -- than in the past , many researchers say .<-->O
What is the role for psychologists ?<-->N
First and foremost , they are providing mental health services to the prison population , which has rates of mental illness at least three times the national average .<-->O
More broadly , they are contributing a growing body of scientific evidence to political and philosophical discussions about the purpose of imprisonment , says Craig Haney , PhD , a psychologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz .<-->N
`` Psychology as a discipline now has a tremendous amount of information about the origins of criminal behavior , '' says Haney .<-->N
`` I think that it is important for psychologists to bring that information to bear in the debate on what kind of crime control policies we , as a society , should follow . ''<-->O
The punitive turn Until the mid-1970s , rehabilitation was a key part of U.S. prison policy .<-->O
Prisoners were encouraged to develop occupational skills and to resolve psychological problems -- such as substance abuse or aggression -- that might interfere with their reintegration into society .<-->O
Indeed , many inmates received court sentences that mandated treatment for such problems .<-->O
Since then , however , rehabilitation has taken a back seat to a `` get tough on crime '' approach that sees punishment as prison 's main function , says Haney .<-->O
The approach has created explosive growth in the prison population , while having at most a modest effect on crime rates .<-->O
As a result , the United States now has more than 2 million people in prisons or jails -- the equivalent of one in every 142 U.S. residents -- and another four to five million people on probation or parole .<-->N
A higher percentage of the population is involved in the criminal justice system in the United States than in any other developed country .<-->N
Many inmates have serious mental illnesses .<-->N
Starting in the late 1950s and 1960s , new psychotropic drugs and the community health movement dramatically reduced the number of people in state mental hospitals .<-->N
But in the 1980s , many of the mentally ill who had left mental institutions in the previous two decades began entering the criminal justice system .<-->O
Today , somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of people in prison are mentally ill , according to U.S. Department of Justice estimates .<-->N
`` Prisons have really become , in many ways , the de facto mental health hospitals , '' says former prison psychologist Thomas Fagan , PhD .<-->N
`` But prisons were n't built to deal with mentally ill people ; they were built to deal with criminals doing time . ''<-->O
The mentally ill The plight of the mentally ill in prisons was virtually ignored for many years , but in the past decade many prison systems have realized -- sometimes with prodding from the courts -- that providing mental health care is a necessity , not a luxury , says Fagan .<-->O
In many prison systems , psychologists are the primary mental health care providers , with psychiatrists contracted on a part-time basis .<-->O
Psychologists provide services ranging from screening new inmates for mental illness to providing group therapy and crisis counseling .<-->N
They also provide rehabilitative services that are useful even for prisoners without serious mental illnesses , says Fagan .<-->O
For example , a psychologist might develop special programs for substance abusers or help prisoners prepare for the transition back to the community .<-->O
But they often struggle to implement such programs while keeping up with their regular prison caseloads .<-->O
`` We 're focused so much on the basic mental health services that there 's not enough time or emphasis to devote to rehabilitative services , '' says Robert Morgan , PhD , a psychologist at Texas Tech University who has worked in federal and state prisons and studies treatment methods for inmates .<-->O
Part of the problem is limited resources , says Morgan : There simply are n't enough mental health professionals in most prisons .<-->O
Haney agrees : `` Many psychologists in the criminal justice system have enormous caseloads ; they 're struggling not to be overwhelmed by the tide . ''<-->O
Another constraint is the basic philosophical difference between psychology , which is rehabilitative at heart , and corrections , which is currently punishment-oriented .<-->O
`` Right now there 's such a focus on punishment -- most criminal justice or correctional systems are punitive in nature -- that it 's hard to develop effective rehabilitative programs , '' says Morgan .<-->O
Relevant research To help shift the focus from punishment to rehabilitation , psychologists are doing research on the causes of crime and the psychological effects of incarceration .<-->O
In the 1970s , when major changes were being made to the U.S. prison system , psychologists had little hard data to contribute .<-->O
But in the past 25 years , says Haney , they have generated a massive literature documenting the importance of child abuse , poverty , early exposure to substance abuse and other risk factors for criminal behavior .<-->O
The findings suggest that individual-centered approaches to crime prevention need to be complemented by community-based approaches .<-->O
Researchers have also found that the pessimistic `` nothing works '' attitude toward rehabilitation that helped justify punitive prison policies in the 1970s was overstated .<-->O
When properly implemented , work programs , education and psychotherapy can ease prisoners ' transitions to the free world , says Haney .<-->O
Finally , researchers have demonstrated the power of the prison environment to shape behavior , often to the detriment of both prisoners and prison workers .<-->O
The Stanford Prison Experiment , which Haney co-authored in 1973 with Stanford University psychologist and APA Past-president Philip G. Zimbardo , PhD , is one example .<-->N
It showed that psychologically healthy individuals could become sadistic or depressed when placed in a prison-like environment .<-->O
More recently , Haney has been studying so-called `` supermax '' prisons -- high-security units in which prisoners spend as many as 23 hours per day in solitary confinement for years at a time .<-->N
Haney 's research has shown that many prisoners in supermax units experience extremely high levels of anxiety and other negative emotions .<-->O
When released -- often without any `` decompression '' period in lower-security facilities -- they have few of the social or occupational skills necessary to succeed in the outside world .<-->N
Nonetheless , supermax facilities have become increasingly common over the past five to ten years .<-->N
`` This is what prison systems do under emergency circumstances -- they move to punitive social control mechanisms , '' explains Haney . ''<-->O
-LSB- But -RSB- it 's a very short-term solution , and one that may do more long-term damage both to the system and to the individuals than it solves . ''<-->N
---------------------- Should Rehabilitation be Preferred Over Punishment in the Criminal Justice System ?<-->N
The criminal justice system is a collective organization that indemnifies any form of crime that happens within the city , state , or any boundary of jurisdiction that then is occupied by law enforcers and judges of the law .<-->O
The criminal justice system is usually a collaborative body , arranging sentences uniformly .<-->O
The US is an exception ; each state may have its own means of law enforcement and mandatory rules that favour the people of the region -LRB- Mandell , 2008 -RRB- .<-->N
The volatility of different criminal justice systems all across the globe further intensifies the debate between rehabilitation and punishment .<-->O
Now , regarding the two modern procedures of handling criminals within the confines of the criminal justice system , rehabilitation quite simply means to restore or bring to a condition of health or useful and constructive activity ?<-->O
-LRB- Merriam - Webster Dictionaries , 2013 -RRB- .<-->N
P unishment means the infliction or imposition of a penalty as retribution for an offence ?<-->O
-LRB- Oxford Dictionaries , 2013 -RRB- .<-->N
The history of the criminal justice system dates back even to the earliest known civilization in Ancient Mesopotamia .<-->O
The earliest known modus operandi of any criminal justice systems can be found in circa 2 nd millennium BCE to 3 rd millennium BCE in the ancient city of Elda -LRB- modern day Syria -RRB- .<-->O
Evidential substance shows that ancient civilizations had already begun their processes of handling criminals in that age -LRB- Danzig , 2010 -RRB- .<-->N
The recent burst in informative technology has caused criminal justice systems all over the world to bifurcate from the usual punishment of criminals .<-->O
Although the societal norm of handling criminal offenders is to punish them or sentence them to a form of retribution , rehabilitation still proves to be more humane and effective when compared to punishment .<-->O
Thus , the main objective of this paper is to show how rehabilitation has successfully reduced recidivism , promoted unity and remained humane and holistic as compared to punishment .<-->O
Firstly , the introduction of the rehabilitation concept promotes a law-abiding society .<-->N
Justice should be a natural response that stems from each individual of society without needing to be prompted or even be forced out via intimidating laws .<-->O
Be it addiction or impulse , every offender is given an unbiased chance to reform from within , and more often than not , criminals who actually go through these cognitive courses come out transformed and remorseful of their past mistakes .<-->O
Such examples can be seen from the successful rehabilitation of 30 of the US ?<-->N
most dangerous men -LRB- Shea , 2008 -RRB- .<-->N
Also , another notorious contribution of punishment is that it provides a government with a mere law-fearing society .<-->O
However , the individuals that now fall under the law only abide by the statutes in a superficial manner .<-->O
A more vivid illustration shows us that this specific type of society does not necessarily live by the rules , but they simply avoid committing lawlessness .<-->O
People will do whatever it takes to accomplish their gratified egos even if that means breaking the most daunting laws in the system .<-->O
Have not the French decided to overthrow the monarchy by demanding for democracy in the face of all the consequences the law would serve them -LRB- NGV International , 2012 -RRB- ?<-->N
Historically , the French Revolution is a prime example of where even the most revered legal system in terms of supremeness has failed in a depressing fashion .<-->O
Next , with rehabilitation , the responsibility of restorative justice does not lie solely with the government and the criminal anymore .<-->O
Instead , the entire community is now involved in aiding a criminal to get back into society in the most humane and most productive manner .<-->O
The emergence of the parole system in Malaysia has continued to show remarkable success in the rehabilitation sector -LRB- BERNAMA , 2013 -RRB- .<-->O
What happens with rehabilitation is that the entire community is now being driven straight into the entire process of reshaping the society , enveloping even the most disreputable criminals to allow them to have a shot at a brighter future .<-->O
With the collaboration between the authorities and the people , the nation prospers because all relevant parties are now contributing towards the well-being of the law .<-->N
When we talk about contact and engagement , only rehabilitation allows the entire community to rub shoulders with one another to work in tandem to better the society and individuals as a whole .<-->O
The community is now engaged in the observation of the criminal?s progress in rehabilitation -LRB- Adams , 2008 -RRB- .<-->N
The criminals now feel like they belong to society .<-->O
Engagement and communication is essential in humanizing a criminal to be a contributor , and not a leech .<-->O
Now , we have to consider how outdated the operation of punishment has really become .<-->O
The earliest forms of the criminal justice system always comes across as law-enforcers being Schadenfreude in the detention of criminals .<-->N
History always supports the motion that punishment always degrades mankind to the level of mere animals .<-->N
Punishment is always sanguisugent or bloodthirsty in nature .<-->N
It demands that law-enforcers force out a compensation for the crime committed while they remain completely inhumane during the course of the operation .<-->O
The Sow of Falaise in 1386 has shown how humans have been executed in the manner of how animals have been mercilessly slaughtered , without dignity -LRB- Friedland , 2012 -RRB- .<-->O
Besides that , punishment was founded in the age of monarchy .<-->N
Therefore a wide range of the punishments that were founded are often the innovation of a single person or with the help of a minor counsel .<-->O
This does not remotely justify the usage of physical punishment because it is often left up to the biased interpretation of a dictator or tyrannical leader .<-->O
Such cases can be observed by bloody incidents during the reign of Emperor Nero in the martyrdom of early Christians -LRB- Tribe , 2011 -RRB- .<-->N
Their criminal justice system provided them with an avenue to execute whomever they pleased as long as they interpreted their actions as anything short of their commandments , even though the victim may have not done anything that is morally wrong .<-->O
Also , the obsolete principles of punishment are not relevant to be practiced in today?s modern criminal justice system .<-->O
The principles practiced in pre-modern eras are considered rather primitive when the level of understanding we have concerning human behavior and how to rehabilitate them is deliberated .<-->O
Hammurabi?s code of law , one of the earliest known statutory statements is primarily based on a principle simplified as an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth .<-->O
Apart from being immersed in the pure concept of revenge as the most acceptable form of retribution , these principles also establish partiality among community sub-groups , favouring the higher class citizens .<-->O
The Code of Hammurabi , when looked at today , shows that rank and class deters the righteousness of the law -LRB- ushistory.org , 2013 -RRB- .<-->O
Also , a brief excerpt from historical literature , the pound of flesh clearly illustrates the mentality of the pre - modern civilizations and what they think about criminal justice .<-->O
Punishment is condoned because it justifies the hunger for vengeance experienced by the victim .<-->O
Vengeance was always a strong yardstick for determining sentences and punishments .<-->N
Revenge was also always considered to be the best way to reinstate harmony after crime is committed -LRB- Green , 2010 -RRB- .<-->O
The satisfaction of vengeance can be sweet for those who have felt an everlasting void in the pain that they?ve experienced , and might even find temporary relief in corporal or capital punishment .<-->O
This , however , throws us into a vicious cycle of violence that ends with complete inability to inculcate the spirit of forgiveness -LRB- Robinson , 2012 -RRB- .<-->O
Instead of progress , we are staring at a community that is reverting to cavemen logic which leads to an ultimate abyss .<-->O
---------------------- Juvenile Justice System Should Focus on RehabilitationLast week , legislators considered L.D. 1765 , a proposal to create a commission that would examine and revise Maine s criminal laws .<-->N
This is an important opportunity for our state to evaluate the effectiveness , objectives and purpose of our criminal justice system .<-->O
Over the last 40 years , the United States has witnessed an unprecedented growth in the size and scope of our correctional system .<-->N
The so-called War on Drugs and a proliferation of tough on crime policies have made ours the largest criminal justice system in the world .<-->O
Even here in Maine , more than 10,000 people are under some form of correctional control .<-->N
Already , Maine s criminal justice system costs taxpayers an estimated $ 160 million per year not to mention the human cost of tearing apart families and depriving people of their liberty .<-->O
Despite this considerable investment , statistics show that nearly 60 percent of those released from Maine prisons will be back behind bars within four years .<-->O
Clearly , it is time to shift our focus from punishment to rehabilitation and successful re-entry into society .<-->N
With growing consensus around the failure of our criminal justice system , it is vital that the Legislature pass L.D. 1765 .<-->O
Once in place , the proposed commission would have the unique opportunity to survey the complete landscape of criminal justice in Maine and implement a fundamental re-alignment of our correctional priorities .<-->O
This can and should include rewriting the stated purposes behind our sentencing practices to include a greater focus on successful re-entry into our communities .<-->N
This includes greater access to treatment , maintaining and encouraging offender ties with friends , families and community members , and more programs to equip offenders with the skills and resources they need to be successful law-abiding citizens .<-->O
While deterrence remains an important part of every criminal justice system , public safety is best protected by focusing our corrections practices on rehabilitation rather than punishment .<-->O
Further , the commission could examine our designated crimes and determine whether criminal sanctions are an appropriate response .<-->O
During the last 40 years , Maine has seen a steady increase in the number of acts considered crimes ; in the last legislative session alone , 24 bills were introduced to either create a new crime or enhance an existing criminal penalty .<-->O
Nowhere is this consideration more important than our failed drug laws .<-->N
Since 1986 , drug arrests in Maine have increased 238 percent , three-quarters of which are for simple possession .<-->N
This uptick in drug arrests has done little or nothing to curb drug use , and Maine has seen a consistent rise in abuse .<-->O
Considering that , we were alarmed when Gov. Paul LePage used his recent State of the State address to call for expanding Maine s criminal justice system in response to this problem .<-->O
Spending millions on more Drug Enforcement Agency agents , prosecutors and judges may put more people in jail , but it won t do anything to address the heart of the addiction problem , which is first and foremost a public health issue and should be treated as such .<-->O
Finally , the commission could look at the length of sentences and their proportionality to the offenses .<-->O
Since the dawn of the tough on crime era , mandatory minimum sentences , truth-in-sentencing policies and three-strikes laws have sent people away for record amounts of time , with questionable benefits for public safety .<-->O
Maine s Tina s Law , for example , added significant mandatory minimum sentences for repeat arrests of some drivers operating on a suspended license .<-->N
Yet since its passage in 2006 , the law appears to have had no significant impact on the rate of crashes involving drivers operating with suspended licenses .<-->N
Given the high cost and extensive consequences that flow from contact with the criminal justice system , we must resist the temptation to use it as a Band-Aid to address all societal problems .<-->O
Instead , we should view correctional control as a severe sanction , to be utilized only when all other alternatives have been exhausted .<-->O
L.D. 1765 is a step in the right direction , although it is not perfect .<-->O
Currently , the proposal would create a commission made up almost entirely of government actors plus one representative each of the state s prosecutors and defense lawyers .<-->O
To have the greatest benefit for our state , the bill should be amended to include an advocate for the rights of those directly affected by the criminal justice system .<-->O
It is time to improve the Maine criminal justice system to better serve individuals , families and our communities .<-->O
Revising the criminal code with an eye toward realigning our priorities and reducing incarceration is a great way to start .<-->N
Should there be a ban on television advertisements aimed at children ?<-->N
Yes ## Ads cause children to beg for products ; harms child-parent relations .<-->O
Advertising specifically to children is unethical because they have little or no money of their own and have to persuade their parents to buy the products for them .<-->O
Rather than advertising directly to parents , companies use a `` nag and whine '' campaign that leads to bad feeling between parents and children .<-->O
They rely on pester power to make adults spend money they don t have on things they don t want to buy , and which their children may well only play with for a few hours .<-->O
## Ads for `` must-have '' products alienates children that `` ca n't have '' .<-->N
Advertising which presents products to children as `` must-have '' is also socially divisive , making children whose parents can not afford them appear inferior , and creating feelings of frustration and inadequacy , as well as leading families into debt .<-->O
Banning ads shirks the individual responsibility of children and parents .<-->N
Advertising has no magical power to create unnatural desires for material possessions .<-->O
Children who nag are simply badly brought up .<-->O
Poor parenting and undisciplined children can not be solved by banning advertising , as children have many influences upon them which can stimulate their desires for toys , etc. , particularly their friends .<-->O
It is also untrue that children have no spending power of their own ; many children under 12 receive pocket money and teenagers are often able to earn a little themselves .<-->O
Learning to manage money is part of growing up , and advertisements help them to choose what they would like to save up for .<-->O
Advertising aimed at children brings negative social consequences .<-->N
Much of it is for food and drinks that are very unhealthy .<-->N
Encouraging gullible children to consume so much fatty , sugary and salty food is unethical because it creates obese , unhealthy youngsters , with bad eating habits that will be with them for life .<-->O
Society also has to pay a high price in terms of the extra medical care such children will eventually require , so the government has a direct interest in preventing advertisements which contribute to this problem .<-->O
Children naturally like foods that are rich in fats , proteins and sugar .<-->O
They give them the energy they need to play energetically and grow healthily .<-->N
It is true that eating only such foods is bad for people , but this is again a problem of bad parenting rather than the fault of advertising .<-->O
And of course , if advertising to children were banned , then governments would not be able to use this means of promoting healthy eating , road safety , hygiene , and other socially useful messages .<-->O
This measure stands alone but has a good precedent in the restrictions placed in most countries upon advertising tobacco and alcohol .<-->O
It also takes a stand against increasingly exploitative marketing campaigns that ruthlessly target children .<-->O
In the USA marketing companies are already offering schools free televisions in exchange for their students being forced to watch a certain amount of programming and advertisements each day , and selling marketing data on those children .<-->N
It is time that childhood was protected from such commercialisation .<-->N
This measure sets a bad precedent which is likely to result in ever more restrictions upon the freedom of expression .<-->O
Children watch many programmes that adults also enjoy , and some adults are also particularly suggestible ; should we then extend this ban to all television advertising .<-->O
And why stop at television when children are also exposed to radio , cinema , the internet and billboards in the street as well ?<-->N
Perhaps companies should also be banned from sponsoring entertainment and sporting events for children , and prevented from providing free branded resources for schools .<-->N
On the other hand , any restrictions will be impossible to enforce as television is increasingly broadcast by satellite across national borders and can not easily be controlled - nor can the internet .<-->O
Exploitative advertising brainwashes children into becoming eager consumers and capitalists .<-->N
Multinational companies deliberately encourage them to be materialistic so that they associate happiness with purchasing power and the possession of particular goods .<-->O
A study recently found that children in Sweden , where marketing campaigns to the under-12s are banned , wanted significantly fewer toys than children in Britain , where there are no restrictions .<-->N
Banning advertisements is a severe restriction upon freedom of speech .<-->O
Companies should be able to tell the public about any legal products , or innovation will be restricted and new companies will find it hard to market their products successfully in the face of established rivals .<-->O
Children also have a human right to receive information from a wide range of sources and make up their own minds about it .<-->O
They are far from being brainwashed by advertisements , which form only a small part of their experiences ; family , friends , school and other television programmes are much more important and all give them alternative views of the world .<-->O
Broadcasting is increasingly diverse , with state-funded , commercial and subscription channels all available in most countries .<-->N
Restricting advertising a little will not make much difference to revenues of commercial broadcasters , and they can be regulated to ensure that they continue to offer a good standard of children s programming .<-->O
Programme quality is likely to improve as much children s television these days involves considerable product-placement and advertising tie-ins , which result in poor programmes and unimaginative formats .<-->O
Advertisements are the means by which most television stations are funded .<-->N
If advertising to children is banned , then broadcasters will stop showing children s programmes , or greatly reduce their quality and quantity , which is clearly not in the public interest .<-->O
State broadcasters funded by a license fee , such as the UK s BBC , and specialist subscription channels that are also not dependent upon advertising revenue would both welcome restrictions upon the ability of commercial broadcasters to compete with them in children s programming .<-->O
As competition is the best means of improving choice , diversity and quality , their lobbying on this issue should be disregarded .<-->O
Nor does advertising only benefit commercial broadcasters , consumers also benefit .<-->N
Greece has banned advertising of toys , and this has led to a more limited selection of toys being sold in Greece .<-->N
Children s magazines rely upon advertising to be affordable - logically under this proposal they should be prevented from doing so , and so effectively shut down .<-->O
-------------------- Advertisements aimed at young children are immoral and should be banned SIR We want to see an immediate end to all advertising aimed at children of primary school age and younger .<-->O
We have sleepwalked into a situation where the advertising industry , worth 12 billion a year in Britain alone , is allowed to turn techniques designed to manipulate adult emotions and desires on to children as young as two or three .<-->O
This is wrong .<-->N
Almost all children under 11 depend on their parents for money .<-->N
So advertising makes heavy use of `` pester power '' , as it is more effective than targeting parents directly .<-->N
Yet a civilised society should require advertisers to sell to parents , not to children .<-->N
When children are learning about the cost of material things , and about managing small quantities of money , they should be free to do so without the pressures put on them by advertising .<-->O
As things stand , we are in danger of turning out young consumers rather than young citizens people who define themselves more by what they buy than by what they can contribute to society .<-->O
Children should be free to channel their energies into forming friendships , discovering their talents and unleashing their imaginations ; things that cost little but whose value is immeasurable .<-->O
Bans on advertising aimed at young children are already working in places such as Sweden , Quebec and Greece .<-->N
It 's time for a similar ban here .<-->N
------------------ Advertising to children is a sensitive and emotionally-charged issue because children are easily influenced and like to experiment with new things .<-->O
The proliferation of products , advertising , promotions and media targeted to children is of concern to lawmakers , the industry and the general public .<-->N
Children 's advertising is under attack because it is perceived as `` making kids want what they do n't need '' and puts pressure on parents to respond to those needs .<-->O
More recently , advertising is accused of being a factor in causing children 's obesity .<-->N
While there are more regulations in effect than ever before , there is a public outcry for even more .<-->N
Much is at stake .<-->N
The children 's market today -LRB- through age 12 -RRB- is estimated to represent $ 500 billion , consisting of both personal spending of $ 200 billion -- primarily for snacks , soft drinks , entertainment and apparel -- and $ 300 billion in directly-influenced spending in these same categories plus food , toys , health and beauty aids , gifts , accessories and school supplies .<-->N
Another $ 500 billion worth of purchases are indirectly influenced in categories such as recreation , technology , vacations , etc. .<-->N
The spending power of children is , altogether , in the area of $ 1 trillion .<-->N
-LRB- 1 -RRB- According to the American Academy of Pediatrics -LRB- AAP -RRB- , the average child watches about four hours of television a day and sees more than 20,000 commercials each year , often for high-fat , high-sugar and high-salt snacks and foods .<-->N
-LRB- 2 -RRB- By the time American children finish high school , they have spent nearly twice as many hours in front of the television set as in the classroom .<-->N
-LRB- 3 -RRB- LEGISLATION The debate about Children 's advertising has prompted legislation over the years .<-->N
Members of Congress have introduced bills to limit advertising time on children 's programming , mandate educational content of those programs and restrict `` program-length commercials . ''<-->O
In 1990 , The Children 's Television Act was passed and remains in effect today .<-->N
Interpreted and enforced by the Federal Communications Commission -LRB- FCC -RRB- , it applies to the networks , local broadcasters and cable operators .<-->N
The bill stipulates that for : Ages 12 and under : The amount of advertising aired during children 's programming should be limited to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays -- still more than for adult prime time ; Ages 16 and under : The FCC is required to consider the amount of educational programming that a broadcaster presents in approving license renewals and examine the role of `` program-length commercials . ''<-->O
-LRB- 4 -RRB- The FCC subsequently ruled that a program based on a toy or children 's product can not contain advertising for that product within the program , although it may directly follow the program .<-->N
`` Program-length commercials , '' however , are not prohibited for fear of jeopardizing positive shows like Sesame Street , despite the fact that it has inspired countless lines of toys .<-->O
The FCC also proposed that stations be required to broadcast three hours of educational children 's programming per week .<-->N
Six years later -LRB- July 1996 -RRB- , this proposal became an FCC ruling which broadcasters -LRB- not cable operators -RRB- must adhere to in order to qualify for license renewal .<-->O
The FCC recently accused Viacom Inc. -LRB- parent company of Nickelodeon -RRB- and the Walt Disney Company -LRB- parent company of the ABC Family Channel -RRB- of violating limits on the use of advertising during children 's programming .<-->N
In October 2004 Viacom and Disney together agreed to pay $ 1.5 million in fines , the largest total fine the FCC had ever levied involving commercial advertising and children 's programs .<-->N
-LRB- 5 -RRB- A GROWING CONCERN : ADVERTISING FOOD TO KIDS Childhood and adolescent obesity is fast becoming a global health concern as figures reach epidemic proportions .<-->O
Almost 16 % of adolescents ages 12-19 and 15 % of children ages 5-11 are currently obese .<-->O
These numbers have more than doubled for children and tripled for adolescents in the past two decades .<-->N
As is the case with tobacco and alcohol , political leaders , consumer advocates , and legal professionals have attributed the growing rate of childhood obesity to unregulated advertising .<-->N
The issue of food marketing and obesity had only surfaced in state legislatures and local courts in June 2004 when Senator Tom Harkin -LRB- D-Iowa -RRB- introduced a broad bill to combat chronic disease and obesity .<-->O
This bill , which was not passed in 2004 , but is viewed as a possible precursor of future legislation , would have granted the Federal Trade Commission -LRB- FTC -RRB- the power to restrict advertising to children .<-->O
-LRB- 6 -RRB- The issue is gaining momentum at a fast pace with urgings from the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- and the American Psychological Association .<-->N
The WHO has already issued white papers in several other countries , documenting the relationship between food advertising and childhood obesity , and as a result , several European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- countries have placed restrictions on food advertising .<-->N
The WHO was a leader in the fight to restrict tobacco advertising worldwide and affected a great deal of change in this respect .<-->O
They will undoubtedly play an important role in this new debate .<-->O
The American Psychological Association has echoed the WHO in a recently released report , calling for more stringent regulations of child-targeted food advertising .<-->N
The outgoing chair of the FTC -LRB- in 2004 -RRB- and the Secretary of Health and Human Services both oppose restricting advertising in favor of educational campaigns to better inform parents and children about good eating and fitness habits .<-->O
To this end , an ad campaign was launched by the Ad Council .<-->N
Industry response to the issue of obesity and food advertising to children has been preemptively strong .<-->N
In June 2004 , The National Advertising Review Council -LRB- NARC -RRB- issued a White Paper entitled , Guidance for Food Advertising Self-Regulation , setting forth the major issues surrounding the volatile debate over food advertising and childhood obesity .<-->O
Citing the epidemic figures of childhood obesity , NARC recognizes that food advertising may indeed be a factor in the epidemic 's fast growing rate .<-->O
However , rather than calling for restrictions , NARC has proposed increased self-regulation by marketers and advertisers .<-->N
NARC believes that it is within its power to bring about closer monitoring of food advertising to children .<-->N
-LRB- Please see Addendum on the Children 's Advertising Review Unit -LRB- CARU -RRB- at the end of this presentation . -RRB-<-->N
Likewise , many agency organizations such as the American Association of Advertising Agencies -LRB- AAAA -RRB- and the Association of National Advertisers -LRB- ANA -RRB- , as well as food manufacturers , oppose legal restrictions on food advertising .<-->O
Along with Coca Cola , McDonalds , General Mills , and Nestle , the AAAA has formed the American Council on Fitness and Nutrition to promote physical activity in schools , effective nutrition education , and applied research on how to bring about lasting behavioral changes .<-->N
The industry believes that any legal injunctions against food advertising is a violation of the First Amendment .<-->N
The AAAA has formed a lobby with some of its members to appear before Congress in order to voice industry concerns about the growing movement to impose restrictions on food advertising .<-->O
Many have dubbed food `` the new tobacco '' and the industry is preparing to protect and defend its position .<-->O
While there are no federal restrictions in place in the U.S. , food marketers are doing what they can to help curb the obesity problem .<-->N
Kraft has voluntarily suspended advertising of some of its less-nutritious products , like Kool-Aid and Oreos , from television , radio and print aimed primarily at children age 6 to 11 .<-->O
Fast food chains , such as McDonalds and Wendy 's , are now offering healthier alternatives to french fries and soft drinks .<-->N
INDUSTRY POSITION Advertisers need to gain the trust of children and their parents through effective and honest advertising .<-->O
In turn , parents must take responsibility for their children : monitor what they watch and read , determine how they spend their free time , and educate them to become responsible and informed consumers .<-->O
Advertising to children will become less controversial only when advertisers and parents assume mutual responsibility for its content and exposure .<-->O
With respect to broadcast advertising , the industry believes that current guidelines - - the careful review and approval process of commercials by the advertiser , its agency , and the station or network that will air the advertising - - provide sufficient controls for children 's advertising .<-->O
According to the AAAA , whose member agencies place more than 80 % of all national advertising in the U.S. , product commercials aired during children 's programming are designed to `` show the product 's features and explain its benefits in terms understandable to children and sensitive to their special attitudes and perceptions . ''<-->O
ADDENDUM CARU : A SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATION FOR CHILDREN 'S ADVERTISING The Children 's Advertising Review Unit -LRB- CARU -RRB- was founded in 1974 to promote responsibility in children 's advertising as part of a strategic alliance with the major advertising trade associations through the National Advertising Review Council -LRB- NARC -RRB- comprising the AAAA , the AAF , the ANA and the Council of Better Business Bureaus -LRB- CBBB -RRB- .<-->O
CARU is the children 's arm of the advertising industry 's self-regulation program and evaluates child-directed advertising and promotional material in all media to advance truth , accuracy and consistency with its Self-Regulatory Guidelines for Children 's Advertising -LRB- www.caru.org/guidelines/index.asp -RRB- and laws .<-->N
Although the great majority of its inquiries are the result of its own monitoring , CARU also entertains consumer complaints and challenges from competing advertisers .<-->O
CARU also provides educational and consulting services to assist advertisers in adhering to its policies .<-->N
CARU 's Guidelines are used as the industry standard .<-->N
The networks have guidelines similar to CARU 's , while cable stations are independent and individually select which guidelines to follow .<-->N
OVERVIEW OF CARU GUIDELINES CARU 's Guidelines address the level of children 's knowledge , sophistication and maturity .<-->N
They apply to all advertising directed to children under age 12 , including print , radio , broadcast and cable television , as well as the Internet .<-->N
CARU 's Guidelines cover the following eight areas : ?<-->F
Product Presentations and Claims ?<-->F
Sales Pressure ?<-->F
Disclosures and Disclaimers ?<-->F
Comparative Claims ?<-->F
Endorsements and Promotions by Program or Editorial Characters ?<-->F
Premiums , Promotions and Sweepstakes ?<-->F
Interactive Electronic Media INQUIRIES BROUGHT BEFORE CARU When an advertisement appears misleading , inaccurate or inconsistent with CARU 's Guidelines , CARU requests that the advertiser substantiate any objective claims or demonstrate -LRB- through consumer perception , safety or other studies -RRB- that the advertising otherwise complies with the Guidelines .<-->O
If a claim can not be substantiated , or compliance with the Guidelines can not be verified , the advertiser is asked to modify or discontinue the advertising .<-->N
If the advertiser declines to comply with a CARU decision , CARU will refer the matter to an appropriate government agency - in most cases the FTC or state attorney general .<-->O
If an advertiser disagrees with CARU 's decision , it may appeal to the National Advertising Review Board -LRB- NARB -RRB- - a representative group of advertisers , advertising agencies , media and the public sector which is the appellate branch of the National Advertising Review Council -LRB- NARC -RRB- , the advertising industry 's self-regulatory forum .<-->N
In 2003 , CARU initiated 144 inquiries , up from 119 in 2002 .<-->F
Of these : ?<-->F
six were substantiated ?<-->F
134 were modified or discontinued ?<-->F
one was sent to the FTC ?<-->F
three were compliance cases where the advertiser had failed to comply with a prior decision .<-->F
The self-policing system works .<-->F
Since 1974 , all but ten of the inquiries investigated by CARU were resolved through the self-regulatory process .<-->F
None of these has been appealed to the NARB , one was referred to the FCC and nine have been referred to the FTC .<-->N
Violations of CARU 's voluntary guidelines occur more often on independent stations and cable channels than on network affiliations .<-->N
-LRB- Note : See Industry Regulations section . -RRB-<-->N
CARU GUIDELINES FOR INTERACTIVE MEDIA CARU 's Guidelines address all media .<-->N
However , increased understanding of children 's use of the Internet contributed to the development of specific guidelines for interactive media in 1996 .<-->N
In order to correspond with the Children 's Online Privacy Protection Act -LRB- COPPA -RRB- , which became effective in April 2000 , these guidelines apply to Web sites directed to children under 13 years of age .<-->N
AAAA supports maximum possible self-regulation for the Internet , but continues to work with government regulators to formulate privacy protection for all online consumers , including children .<-->N
AAAA generally characterized the COPPA rules as workable , and applauded the designation of the CARU Guidelines as a `` safe harbor '' under COPPA .<-->N
The guidelines related to the Internet include : ?<-->N
Reasonable efforts , using all available technology , should be made to establish full disclosure and choice exercised by a parent or guardian when a site wishes to obtain personally identifiable information from children for marketing purposes . ?<-->O
Advertisers who maintain children 's sites should not knowingly link their sites to pages of other sites not in compliance with CARU 's guidelines . ?<-->N
Advertisers who communicate with children via e-mail should remind and encourage parents to regularly monitor their children 's e-mail and online activities . ?<-->N
Information collected for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent should not be kept in retrievable form by the site if consent is not received in a reasonable amount of time .<-->O
While these guidelines highlight issues unique to Internet and online advertising to children under 13 , they should also be used within the broader context of overall Guidelines , which apply to advertising in all media .<-->O
-------------- Ads are a breach of our personal space Ads should be removed completely or moved to an allocated channel specifically for advertisement and if we so choose to see it then that should be our choice to do so , Because when I pay my money for a tv cable and electricity I do not expect nor want to be shoved in my face more consumerism continually every 15mins of watching something a barrage of ads that Is forced apon me why do this I am not a trained monkey I will only buy something if I ever needed it or I wanted something not because tv ads have shoved it in my psyche I do n't believe I have ever bought anything on a whim from watching an ad apart from a mcdonalds but that 's another story , for obese people they are basically advertising there drug of choice would u do that for a heroin addict , , the amount of time through the years I have had to watch ads is shocking if u think about it .<-->O
Advertisement is everywhere but the last place I want it is in my home every day .<-->N
Its like there 's no respect we are just consuming robots , the entire four to five mins or more of ad breaks around 10 different ads flashed in my face its got to the point tv can stress me out because .<-->O
Concentration is continuously being tested I now mute ads but if I am paying the money I should have the right to dictate like everyone else whether we want to see ads or not No !<-->O
Television should n't be banned , it 's also educational and very informative .<-->O
How would we cope without news and catching up with what goes around in society .<-->N
I understand that our bodies are effected but to be honest , everything has a risk .<-->O
People just have to control what they do and work around the problems .<-->O
Sex ads and drug ads The ads that talk about viagra and other sexual ads on t.V influence children to look into sexual activities more often .<-->N
They also influence children into drugs and drinking as well .<-->N
I have seen some ads on t.V. .<-->N
That make me sick just at the fact my 7 and 9 year old sons are watching it with me .<-->O
The shows are also influencing my kids to ask questions that they shouldnt even ask at the ages of 13 .<-->N
No , television ads directed at children should not be banned .<-->N
What is needed is more media literacy education .<-->N
Children need to know that they are being bombarded by messages -LRB- both good and bad -RRB- every day .<-->O
They need to be taught how to discern these messages from a very early age and to decide how to react to the messages based on content AND controller Ads encourage alcohol use The ads aimed at children encourage drug and alcohol use by making it seem fun and cool .<-->O
Just like how coca cola commercials advertise for a drink that is refreshing .<-->O
They even play the ads on commercial breaks during shows that teenagers watch .<-->N
What they obviously dont show in these commercials is how bad alcohol is for children and teenagers .<-->O
Long term consumption can lead to brain damage , ive heard of a lot of underage drinkers binge drinking .<-->N
This all stems from advertisements encouraging children my age to drink up .<-->N
Toy manufacturers have to be able to market their products to children , otherwise they would go out of business - plus it would be impossible to enact this ban .<-->O
Children 's television ads should not be banned because it 's how children find new toys to play with .<-->N
Also - toy manufacturers would go out of business if they could not advertise to children .<-->N
It 's also impossible to imagine that such a ban could actually be effectively put in place .<-->O
And it 's difficult to argue the intended audience of many advertisements - hence creating a slippery slope between catering to children , adults or teenagers .<-->N
Tv Ads featuring sexual innuendos and undertones or even revealing clothing or suggestive scenery is an infringement on the privacy of my home During the Super Bowl , the commercial with the naked woman and the cheeseburger came on .<-->O
Not only did I see way more than i wanted to , but an entire room full of children saw it too .<-->O
This awakened questions that i thought would not be asked , let alone answered for years to come .<-->N
It is annoying that one can not watch a football game without seeing nudity , sexual scenes , and hear innuendos No , I disagree , because I feel it would be a violation of freedom of speech and expression .<-->O
I feel that a ban on television commercials aimed at children would be a violation of freedom of speech and freedom of press .<-->O
Maybe in another country this ban would be allowed , but in the U.S. , it should not not allowed .<-->N
The First Amendment clearly states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof .<-->O
Nor will it abridge the freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press .<-->O
And finally , it will not forbid the right of the people to peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances .<-->O
You can read the U.S. constitution in full at this link : http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am1 .<-->N
No no no !!<-->N
If we stop these adds it would have a negative effect on the economy because people would lose jobs and businesses would shut down .<-->O
Not good ... Also Nowadays whenever we go , we can see advertisement and in marketing we need advertisement because its help to attract the consumer for any value .<-->O
The benefits of the advertisement are to increase the product sells and make profit .<-->N
In our group we agreed that targeting children in advertisement is good , and the great deal of advertisement on television is aimed at children by promoting different kind of product such as food , drinks , toys , clothes , and ext. .<-->O
If we will speak about food children naturally like foods that are riches in fats , proteins , and sugar , it s give them energy and power to grow .<-->O
It s true that eating lots of these things is bad put it is gain a problem of bad parenting rather than the fault of advertising .<-->O
So we can not blame the advertisement .<-->N
In addition to that there are lots of different advertisements that teach the children a good thing for example lifebuoy soap it s taught the children how to clean and wash their hands clearly and remove the germs from it .<-->O
Also the nido milk advertisement its shows the children that if they drink it they will have a very good a strong health and bones .<-->O
Nido advertising is encouraging the children to drink it .<-->N
Well I do not think there should be a ban on television advertisements aimed at children since they are also a very important target audience .<-->O
Advertisers need to reach out to children .<-->N
Moreover it would be better if there could be a reasonable amount of censorship as well as restriction rather than banning the whole thing .<-->O
Advertisements targeting children aim to promote the products and services .<-->N
Advertisements targeting children aim to promote the products and services , which cater for children 's needs and have no damaging intention at all .<-->O
Should be banned When it comes to commericals they are very persuasive .<-->N
Especially in the mind of a young child .<-->N
For example in beer commericals they describe how the beer is delish and great for you .<-->N
This child will be influcened by the ways of the commercial and want to drink .<-->O
As the child gets older they will have a habit of drinking and at an early age become an alcoholic .<-->N
IS THIS THE KIND OF WAY A CHILD SHOULD LIVE !<-->N
Other commercials may be far worse , and do a lot of damage to a young person .<-->N
There should not be a ban on television advertisements aimed at children because there is nothing wrong with such advertisements There should not be a ban on television advertisements aimed at children because a ban would imply that the advertisers are somehow to blame for Generation Y 's need to have brand name products .<-->O
Most who complain about there being too many ads geared toward children argue that the ads make kids think that they need to have the latest and greatest in toys and other products .<-->O
However , there 's nothing wrong with seeing a few ads .<-->N
It should be the parent 's responsibility to monitor how much TV their child is actually watching so that they are not overexposed to said ads .<-->O
That 's not the responsibility of the government or an industry .<-->N
It Should Be Banned I think that it should be banned , because when you see something on TV you become curious or you want to know more and its not right .<-->O
Some stations are excluded because they are teen - to - adult shows and they should know what they are watching and the ads that come up .<-->N
Parents should feel safe about what the kids are watching I do not think there should be a ban on TV advertisements aimed at children .<-->O
I do not think there should be a ban on TV advertisements aimed at children .<-->N
Children are one of the main consumers of television , and that is a great way for companies and organizations to get information about their products out to them .<-->N
Parents are able to control what children watch on television , and whether they can watch it or not .<-->N
Advertisements geared towards children are not harmful to them , and I think its more important to worry about the too mature TV shows that some children are watching rather than a company advertisement about a new toy .<-->O

--------------------- Ever since he first started practicing , Berkeley , Calif. , psychologist Allen D. Kanner , PhD , has been asking his younger clients what they wanted to do when they grew up .<-->N
The answer used to be `` nurse , '' `` astronaut '' or some other occupation with intrinsic appeal .<-->N
Today the answer is more likely to be `` make money . ''<-->N
For Kanner , one explanation for that shift can be found in advertising .<-->N
`` Advertising is a massive , multi-million dollar project that 's having an enormous impact on child development , '' says Kanner , who is also an associate faculty member at a clinical psychology training program called the Wright Institute .<-->N
`` The sheer volume of advertising is growing rapidly and invading new areas of childhood , like our schools . ''<-->O
According to Kanner , the result is not only an epidemic of materialistic values among children , but also something he calls `` narcissistic wounding '' of children .<-->N
Thanks to advertising , he says , children have become convinced that they 're inferior if they do n't have an endless array of new products .<-->N
Now Kanner and several colleagues are up-in-arms about psychologists and others who are using psychological knowledge to help marketers target children more effectively .<-->O
They 're outraged that psychologists and others are revealing such tidbits as why 3 - to 7-year-olds gravitate toward toys that transform themselves into something else and why 8 - to 12-year-olds love to collect things .<-->O
Last fall , Kanner and a group of 59 other psychologists and psychiatrists sent a controversial letter protesting psychologists ' involvement to APA .<-->N
In response , at its June meeting , APA 's Board of Directors acted on a recommendation from the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest and approved the creation of a task force to study the issue .<-->N
The task force will examine the research on advertising 's impact on children and their families and develop a research agenda .<-->N
The group will look at the role psychologists play in what some consider the exploitation of children and consider how psychology can help minimize advertising 's harmful effects and maximize its positive effects .<-->O
The group will also explore implications for public policy .<-->N
Task force members will be chosen in consultation with Div .<-->N
37 -LRB- Child , Youth and Family Services -RRB- and other relevant divisions .<-->N
Unethical practices ?<-->N
The letter protesting psychologists ' involvement in children 's advertising was written by Commercial Alert , a Washington , D.C. , advocacy organization .<-->N
The letter calls marketing to children a violation of APA 's mission of mitigating human suffering , improving the condition of both individuals and society , and helping the public develop informed judgments .<-->O
Urging APA to challenge what it calls an `` abuse of psychological knowledge , '' the letter asks APA to : Issue a formal , public statement denouncing the use of psychological principles in marketing to children .<-->O
Amend APA 's Ethics Code to limit psychologists ' use of their knowledge and skills to observe , study , mislead or exploit children for commercial purposes .<-->O
Launch an ongoing campaign to investigate the use of psychological research in marketing to children , publish an evaluation of the ethics of such use , and promote strategies to protect children against commercial exploitation by psychologists and others using psychological principles .<-->O
`` The information psychologists are giving to advertisers is being used to increase profits rather than help children , '' says Kanner , who helped collect signatures for the letter .<-->O
`` The whole enterprise of advertising is about creating insecure people who believe they need to buy things to be happy .<-->O
I do n't think most psychologists would believe that 's a good thing .<-->O
There 's an inherent conflict of interest . ''<-->O
Advertisers ' efforts seem to work .<-->N
According to marketing expert James U. McNeal , PhD , author of `` The Kids Market : Myths and Realities '' -LRB- Paramount Market Publishing , 1999 -RRB- , children under 12 already spend a whopping $ 28 billion a year .<-->N
Teen-agers spend $ 100 billion .<-->N
Children also influence another $ 249 billion spent by their parents .<-->N
The effect this rampant consumerism has on children is still unknown , says Kanner .<-->N
In an informal literature review , he found many studies about how to make effective ads but not a single study addressing ads ' impact on children .<-->N
Instead , he points to research done by Tim Kasser , PhD , an assistant professor of psychology at Knox College in Galesburg , Ill. .<-->N
In a series of studies , Kasser has found that people who strongly value wealth and related traits tend to have higher levels of distress and lower levels of well-being , worse relationships and less connection to their communities .<-->O
`` Psychologists who help advertisers are essentially helping them manipulate children to believe in the capitalistic message , when all the evidence shows that believing in that message is bad for people , '' says Kasser .<-->O
`` That 's unethical . ''<-->N
Driving out psychologists Psychologists who help companies reach children do n't agree .<-->N
Take Whiton S. Paine , PhD , an assistant professor of business studies at Richard Stockton College in Pomona , N.J. .<-->N
As principal of a Philadelphia consulting firm called Kid2Kid , Paine helps Fortune 500 companies market to children .<-->N
Paine has no problem with launching a dialogue about psychologists ' ethical responsibilities or creating standards similar to ones used in Canada and Europe to protect children from commercial exploitation .<-->O
Such activities will actually help his business , he says , by giving him leverage when clients want to do something that would inadvertently harm children .<-->O
What Paine does have a problem with is driving psychologists out of the business .<-->N
`` If you remove ethical psychologists from the decision-making process in an ad 's creation , who 's left ? ''<-->N
he asks .<-->N
`` People who have a lot less sensitivity to the unique vulnerabilities of children . ''<-->O
Others who have read the proposal point out that psychological principles are hardly confidential .<-->N
`` We ca n't stop alcohol or tobacco companies from using the basic research findings and theories found in textbooks and academic journals , '' says Curtis P. Haugtvedt , PhD , immediate past president of Div .<-->N
23 -LRB- Consumer Psychology -RRB- and an associate professor of marketing at Ohio State University in Columbus .<-->N
`` The same issue exists for all sciences : the information is available in public libraries . ''<-->N
The problem with trying to regulate the use of psychological principles is that `` people acting in ways psychologists find objectionable probably are n't members of APA anyway , '' says Haugtvedt , who received a copy of the Commercial Alert letter .<-->O
He believes that having general guidelines as to appropriate uses and areas of concern would be beneficial to all parties .<-->O
Daniel S. Acuff , PhD , for example , draws on the child development courses he took during his graduate schooling in education to advise such clients as Disney , Hasbro and Kraft .<-->N
His book `` What Kids Buy and Why : The Psychology of Marketing to Kids '' -LRB- Free Press , 1997 -RRB- draws on child development research to show product developers and marketers how to reach children more effectively .<-->N
To Acuff , the letter to APA is not only an `` unconstitutional '' attempt to limit how professionals make their living but also a misguided overgeneralization .<-->O
Since Acuff and his partner started their business in 1979 , they have had a policy guiding their choice of projects .<-->N
As a result , they turn down assignments dealing with violent video games , action figures armed with weapons and other products they believe are bad for children .<-->O
Their work focuses instead on products that they consider either good for children or neutral , such as snacks and sugary foods parents can use as special treats .<-->O
The letter to APA fails to acknowledge that psychological principles can be used for good as well as bad , he says .<-->O
`` I do n't agree with black-and-white thinking , '' says Acuff , president of Youth Market Systems Consulting in Sherman Oaks , Calif. `` Psychology in itself is neither good nor bad .<-->O
It 's just a tool like anything else . ''<-->O
---------------- Views concerning the ethics of advertising aimed at children diverge widely in Europe .<-->N
In Sweden it is considered unacceptable and is banned for children under 12 with the approval of the majority of the population .<-->N
In France advertisements are seen as part of preparing children for future life in a consumer society .<-->N
There seems to be agreement that certain regulations at least are necessary - as the existence of restrictions in all European countries shows .<-->O
However , the degree to which advertisement to children is regulated again varies widely from country to country .<-->N
see also teaching and study resource early years education for peace Email this page to a friend In the UK , restrictions exist on ads that ` might result in harm to children physically , mentally or morally ' and on ads employing methods that ` take advantage of the natural credulity and sense of loyalty of children ' .<-->O
Nor may advertisements ` exhort children to purchase or to ask their parents or others to make enquiries or purchases ' .<-->N
There are rules on food advertising , health , hygiene , safety and decency and there are restrictions on transmission time -LRB- for alcohol , medicines and slimming products -RRB- -LSB- Independent Television Commission , Rules on Advertisements to Children , 1997 -RSB- .<-->N
Greece has a ban on advertisements for children 's toys between 7 am and 10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys .<-->N
Are the relatively unspecific rules in the UK enough and does legislation in Greece go too far ?<-->N
Most European consumer organisations call for strong limitations of commercial activity directed at children .<-->N
Out of the 15 EU countries , only 4 -LRB- France , Ireland , the Netherlands and the UK -RRB- do not consider advertising aimed at children as harmful , and Spain alone considers a ban on advertisement undemoratic .<-->O
The present move to harmonise legislation in this area on a EU-wide basis raises a number of issues concerning how far legislation should go .<-->O
The development of critical sense One argument in favour of little regulation is the educative aspect of exposing children to advertisement .<-->O
Children 's reactions to advertisement can be very different from grown-ups .<-->N
If adults see a product advertised and do n't find it when they go shopping they forget about it .<-->N
As children develop the ability to recognise and understand ads and their purpose they start making demands .<-->O
If these demands are not fulfilled they might start screaming or throwing themselves to the floor .<-->O
It is difficult to explain to young children the reasons why they can not have everything which - according to advertising - is ` for them ' .<-->N
Research by advertising agencies has confirmed that children 's personal preferences can be targeted and changed by TV advertising .<-->N
Family dynamics are thus influenced by advertisements that create demands and provide children with arguments why they should want a particular thing ; this can make life extremely difficult for parents who for financial or moral reasons refuse to comply .<-->O
Swedish public opinion considers advertising to children ` not fair play ' .<-->N
Besides the ban on advertising to children under 12 , the law prohibits displays of sweets in shops within reach of little children and stipulates that attention must be paid to problems that could arise when parents queue up .<-->O
Are Swedish children thus cheated out of their chance to develop critical sense in relation to advertising ?<-->O
And will they be less able , when they grow up , to deal with the disappointment of not possessing everything they see advertised ?<-->O
It would seem to be fairer and more sensible to start educating children about the commercial intentions of companies at an age when they can rationalise and are no longer predominantly motivated by emotions .<-->O
Expecting children to learn about advertisements before that age would seem to be rather futile as well as creating difficulties for the child and the family .<-->O
The effects of advertising There is another aspect to the ` educational dimension ' - argument which raises questions .<-->N
For , even once children have ` developed critical sense ' in relation to advertisements , they are still being subliminally influenced by them .<-->O
If adults , who have had years of practice in seeing through and being able to deal with ads , could not be swayed in their decisions to choose or buy products then no company would spend millions on advertising .<-->O
Research has confirmed the influence of the media upon the close conformity between children 's tastes and perceived needs and the content of the programmes they watch .<-->O
Teachers say they know what has been on TV the night before by the games the children play the next day .<-->N
Research carried out by the Independent Television Commission has found that the effectiveness of advertising increases when the ads are shown in between or around programmes aimed at children , or when children perceive an advertisement to be made ` for them ' as , for example , with toys or breakfast cereals .<-->N
If the subliminal effects of advertisement were not officially perceived as a danger , attempts would not be made to promote a healthier diet in England by prohibiting ads which ` encourage or condone excessive consumption of any food , . .<-->O
depict situations where it could reasonably be assumed that teeth are unlikely to be cleaned overnight , ... or encourage children to consume food or drink especially sweet sticky foods near bedtime ' -LRB- ITC rules on food advertising to children , 1995 -RRB- .<-->O
What would be the sense of prohibiting advertisements in which children climb up to shelves , are shown near an open fire without a fireguard or play ` irresponsibly ' near water -LRB- ITC rules -RRB- if it was thought that they had no influence ?<-->O
An important point in this connection is the fact that in 9 out of the 15 EU countries enforcement of the rules on advertising to children is felt to be inadequate -LSB- ` Children and Advertising ' , Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs , 1997 -RSB- .<-->O
In the UK , for example , criticism has been levelled at the ITC for not carrying out systematic monitoring and for ineffective sanctions - there are no fines or obligations for corrective advertisement .<-->O
Even where enforcement is considered to be effective , problems arise with TV stations transmitting from other countries which are not legally subject to the regulations of the receiving county .<-->N
Thus we have a situation where the need for regulation and the danger of the imitative aspect of advertising to children is generally acknowledged , but where regulations are rarely fully enforced .<-->O
Furthermore , children are , on the one hand , deemed to need protection from bad examples while on the other hand , they are allowed to be exposed to the commercial intentions of companies who use the latest research to target and psychologically influence children to their own commercial gain .<-->O
This influence , additionally , goes quite a lot further than just trying to persuade children that they want or need certain products .<-->O
Education in consumerism Advertisements today are not so much about the products but rather about the character of the consumers and how they should feel when they use or possess the advertised product .<-->O
Messages to children are all about the happiness , social status or success which accompany the possession or consumption of a certain toy or type of food .<-->O
Advertisement research found that the media can isolate and shape children 's preferences for different toys , TV characters , life styles , subcultures , etc. at different ages .<-->N
Advertising proved to be particularly effective if these preferences were then fed back to them in the ads .<-->O
A double reinforcement of values takes place , where children 's preferences are formed by the media and presented to them again in advertising .<-->O
Children who are exposed to a lot of advertising are thus educated about a particular lifestyle : they are educated about living in a consumer society .<-->O
They learn certain attitudes - the importance of money , what products are needed , how they are to be used and how products are supposed to make them feel .<-->O
Allowing business interests and economic criteria to determine what children are exposed to when watching ads will undoubtedly have some effect on their future outlook on society .<-->O
The freedom of expression In Spain a ban on advertisement is considered undemocratic .<-->N
Would the prohibition on tobacco advertisements be seen as equally undemocratic since tobacco companies are legally prevented from using TV advertisements to convince people that damaging and perhaps fatally damaging their health is a cool thing to do ?<-->O
Advertisement does not potentially kill children , but the question remains what particular freedom would be lost , and what disadvantage incurred , if children were not exposed from an early age to TV advertisements directed at them for the commercial gain of companies .<-->O
After all , the companies certainly do not have the children 's moral or social well-being in mind ; they are solely concerned about profits .<-->O
Should corporal punishment be reintroduced in schools ?<-->N
The Children Need to Be Straightened Out Children are terrible things that create horror wherever they travel .<-->O
They need something to straighten them out and it has been proven that beating children is greatly beneficial for their lives .<-->O
Many may disagree but in all honesty corporal punishment benefitted all of the great leaders of the past to motivate themselves for greater causes .<-->O
That is why corporal punishment should be reintroduced to schools Of course not .<-->N
If corporal punishment is reintroduced , what would the kids think of us !<-->N
` Their back with flogging be lacerated and often painted with their crimson gore ' -LRB- Morton bay , 3rd verse -RRB- .<-->N
Sure , this is just a song , but it 's true !<-->O
Also it will teach the kids bad habits and make them hit in public , which is DEFINITELY not okay .<-->O
I believe corporal punishment should be reintroduced in schools Children can just get put in the naughty corner or get detentions , some kids can just have that and learn , but what about those who do n't respond well to that .<-->O
This is teaching our kids that life is easy and that creates a brat .<-->N
I believe that some students need more discipline than others and this is why .<-->O
We should n't just beat the kids every time they do something , but we should know when we should and when we should just give them detention .<-->O
Especially in what type of schools .<-->N
Therefore it is also your responsibility as teachers , to know when they should be disciplined and how .<-->O
That is too much .<-->N
Some punishment is necessary , but kids should not be beaten .<-->N
That is a cruel and unusual punishment , and therefore is against the law .<-->O
All adults were children in schools once , and they most likely did n't get beaten .<-->N
Are all adults criminals ?<-->N
So kids not kept in line so brutally would not become criminals .<-->O
I am a student I am a student , year ten , and i do believe that we should reintroduce corporal punishment .<-->N
Most kids in my school are disrespectful little hooligans , and do just what they want .<-->O
I for one would much prefer living among civilised kids , whom would one day not become criminals .<-->O
Corporal punishment is there to scare kids into doing the right thing .<-->O
And make them regret their wrong .<-->N
It should not .<-->N
Corporal punishment should not be reintroduced in schools .<-->N
It is not up to the school system to keep kids in line and make sure that they are punished .<-->N
If kids are misbehaving and causing trouble , schools should put them in detention or suspend them and let the parents punish the kids .<-->O
Discipline is out of our schools nowadays because of the banning of corporal punishment .<-->N
We the prefects and the teachers know what we are suffering.I say yes to that.Even if authorities doubt it , they should reintroduce and see how magically it will work.I have tried it before and i know how it works , it is instill discipline in the children both at home and in school .<-->O
Child abuse anyone ?<-->N
Corporal punishment is in the past , it is a thing of the brutal unloving past .<-->N
We are in a new age in which violence with children is being seen as wrong , so why would we introduce it in the very place that should be a safe , friendly , learning environment for our children .<-->O
Corporal punishment might also introduce more emotional damage in children , especially younger ones , which either leads them to be more violent and less compassionate , or maybe extremely emotionally damaged , which might lead to extreme depression or insanity .<-->O
Not good This means better futures Some may say that it will abuse and scare the children , but it is a most perfect way to stop them doing things against rules .<-->O
A room where you sit and listen to teachers is not daunting for these children .<-->N
A cane , whip or even enema is enough to scare the hell out of them .<-->O
I personally think that if this does not go on , they will grow to be criminals --------------- 1 .<-->O
Do you think anti social behaviour in our schools should be punished ?<-->N
YES 2 .<-->N
How do you see this punishment being administered ?<-->F
` pick one below ' C 3 .<-->F
Should good behaviour be rewarded ?<-->F
YES 4 .<-->N
How ??? -LRB- brief description please -RRB- Points that can be collected and then can be turned in to appropriate prizes for children .<-->N
Do you think people who commit anti social misdemeanours should be looked up to and deemed cool by other pupils ?<-->N
NO 6 .<-->N
Which sex do you consider the most disruptive in school ?<-->O
a. male Yes , zero tolerance approach , no tie or correct uniform detention , no homework etc right up to violence against fellow pupils and staff .<-->O
The punishment should fit the crime , but not corporal punishment it has gone and it would never be successfully reintroduced .<-->O
It is not a good message thumping little Tommy is punished by a bigger person hitting you ?<-->N
It is very important that good behaviour is rewarded and that also means consistent good behaviour as well , not just as an incentive for naughty children .<-->O
Good question ... a good reward system , educational awards not financial .<-->O
Whilst it is not ideal that the antisocial kid is seen as the coolest it is inevitable , the coolest girls in my school I thought were the ones who broke the rules , flouted uniform rules and smoked .<-->O
I think that both sexes are disruptive , a Catherine Tate whatever attitude is almost as bad as the violent boy as both undermine the authority of staff and upset the smooth running of the class .<-->O
I do n't think antisocial behavior should be punished , but the antisocial students should be treated the same as the rest of the student body .<-->O
I would recommend rephrasing this question , and I refuse to answer by picking one .<-->O
Punish students for things they have done , not things they are .<-->N
Good behavior should be rewarded , if by `` good '' you mean academically .<-->O
Examples are National Honor Society , Honor Roll , art show ribbons , other rewards for achievement in sports , the arts , and academics .<-->N
If by antisocial misdemeanors you mean dressing differently and speaking one 's mind , yes .<-->O
Smoking in the boys ' room , no , how moche .<-->N
I 'm a female , and I was the most disruptive one in my Government and Psychology classes .<-->N
I do think that anti-social behaviour should be addressed using positive means .<-->O
Such as detentions during the day as well as after the school day .<-->N
In this time schools should help the anti-social children by running anger management courses - methods can include : Positive Self Talk , Auto - suggestion , Rationalisation , Relaxation Training , Muscle Control and Breathing Exercises , Systematic Desensitisation , Stress Inoculated Training , Rational Emotive Therapy , Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Positive Thinking .<-->O
This results in an increase in positive image , confidence and self worth of the aggressive person so that they can grow to accept and love themselves , and become more able to express love for others .<-->O
Identify ` positives ' in their lives and within personal response patterns , and positively reinforce at every opportunity .<-->O
When self worth , increased confidence , love and self acceptance have been established , the expression of inappropriate anger and aggression is ecouraged in a safe environment .<-->O
This is helped by talking anger out , writing it out , acting it out , drawing and painting it out , or by any appropriate vigorous activity .<-->O
Relaxation Training , Muscle Control and Breathing Exercises are also helpful ways to sustain improvement , along with the positive reinforcement of significant others and appropriate self talk .<-->O
I have known both male and female aggressors within my own classroom experiences and personally stereotyping it as a gender problem is totally wrong as no two people - whether female or male are the same .<-->N
--------------- I believe that we should reintroduce corporal punishment in schools , there are several benefits : First , it works immediately , to corporal punishment , teachers do n't have to spend time think of other punishment , and students are all afraid of corporal punishment because of pain , the effect is good .<-->O
Second , kill one man will terrorize a thousand , when the teacher is corporal punishing the student , the student is unlucky , and other students will be afraid and wo n't make the same mistake .<-->O
Now government says love education , no corporal punishment , however , this makes teacher give up correct students ' mistake , and students wo n't be good and put on airs and look down on other people , teachers can only be worldly wise and play safe .<-->O
Also there are to English proverbs , put down the whip , spoil a child .<-->N
Child is like a horse , whips it before it works .<-->O
--------------- bad behaviour is on the increase in the class room In a survey completed by the Times Educational supplement -LRB- 1 -RRB- , 6000 teachers were questioned .<-->N
One in five believed that class room behaviour had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment and they believed the education system would improve with the re-introduction of corporal punishment .<-->N
We should adhere to the teachers requests .<-->N

at a loss i am ... One in five teachers ?<-->N
That is the also the figure then of how many teachers need more training !<-->N
The only reason why a minority of teachers want to see a reintroduction of corporal punishment is because they do not have any effective discipline methods under their belts .<-->O
The answer ?<-->N
More training , not resorting to corporal punishment .<-->N
Also remember that school is for learning and it is the teachers job if the students are doing poorly .<-->N
Corporate Punishment is just and excuse for teachers to whip and hurt people It is inevitable that bad classroom behaviour will filter into life outside school .<-->O
You only have to look at the crime statistics to see that crime has increased dramatically since the abolition of corporal punishment .<-->O
Between 1981 , when corporal punishment was legal and in 1997 , after the abolition of corporal punishment , there was a 67 % increase in crime -LRB- 1 -RRB- .<-->N
-LRB- 1 -RRB- http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/digest4/chapter1.pdf Additionally , the U.K. 's banning of corporal punishment is not attached to a propaganda website called nospanking.com and portrays a more convincing argument for reintroducing corporal punishment since it clearly documents crime statistics before and after the abolition of corporal punishment in schools .<-->O
On the other hand , the opposing argument contradicts itself .<-->N
How can you refute that the abolition of corporal punishment has not led to an increase in crime because of varying factors when the case that you cite to support your argument is so biased and overlooks a large number of factors - such as poverty , drop outs , consistent use of paddling , perceived fairness of paddling , credible or qualified teachers , etc. .<-->O
How can you realistically argue against a corporal punishment that has successfully been used for thousands of years in home and without to discipline children ?<-->O
It 's worked for all this time and managed to create fairly decent , responsible human beings without traumatizing them .<-->O
Pro-Spanking Research : A study published in the Akron Law Review in 2009 examined criminal records and found that children raised where a legal ban on parental corporal punishment is in effect are much more likely to be involved in crime .<-->O
For example , in Sweden enlightened parenting seems to have produced increased violence later .<-->N
Swedish teen violence skyrocketed in the early 1990s , when children that had grown up entirely under the spanking ban first became teenagers , Fuller noted .<-->N
Preadolescents and teenagers under fifteen started becoming even more violent toward their peers .<-->N
By 1994 , the number of youth criminal assaults had increased by six times the 1984 rate .<-->N
... Margaret Gunnoe in 1997 published work showing that customary spanking reduced aggression , but it went largely unnoticed by the media because it contradicted mainstream opinion .<-->O
Of course , we all know that aggression is often the main culprit in violent crime .<-->O
... Dr. Diana Baumrind of the University of California , Berkeley also found that children who were never spanked tended to have behavioral problems , and were not more competent than their peers .<-->N
This supports the view that banning spanking would lead to an increase in crime .<-->O
You can not single handedly blame the banning of corporal punishment for the rapid rise in crime .<-->O
There are many factors , and there is nothing that definitively shows that there is a link between the banning of corporal punishment and the rise in crime .<-->N
There are many things that have changed and the rise in crime is a combination of some or maybe even all of these factors , things like increase in population , increasing living expectations , the poor and the rich living in a close proximity .<-->O
We should not bring back corporal punishment on a whim that it may possibly decrease the levels of crime .<-->O
Also , this theory was tested in America , where it 's flipped around and the states in the US that had corporal punishment were the states with the highest murder rates .<-->N
Those eight paddling states are .<-->N
in order by murder rate : Louisiana , which has the highest murder rate in the nation -LRB- 6th in the nation by percentage of students struck by educators -RRB- ; Mississippi , which has the 2nd highest murder rate in the nation -LRB- 1st by percentage of students struck by educators -RRB- ; Georgia .<-->O
which has the 4th highest murder rate -LRB- 7th in the nation by percentage of students struck by educators -RRB- ; Alabama and New Mexico , tied with the 5th highest murder rate in the nation -LRB- 3rd and 10th , respectively , by percentage of students struck by educators -RRB- ; Tennessee , which has the 7th highest murder rate -LRB- 4th by percentage of students struck by educators -RRB- ; and North Carolina and Arizona , which are tied with the 9th highest murder rate in the nation -LRB- 12th and 18th , respectively , by percentage of students struck by educators -RRB- .<-->O
The two non-paddling states are : Maryland , which has the 4th highest murder rate ; and Illinois , which is tied with Tennessee with the 7th highest murder rate .<-->N
Murder Rate -LRB- lowest -RRB- : Of the states with the ten lowest murder rates in the nation , educators paddle children in one of them .<-->N
That paddling state is Idaho , which has the 3rd lowest murder rate -LRB- 18th by percentage of students hit -RRB- .<-->N
The nine non-paddling states are : North Dakota , which has the lowest murder rate in the nation ; South Dakota , which has the 2nd lowest murder rate ; Maine , which is tied with Idaho with the 3rd lowest murder rate ; Vermont , with the 5th lowest murder rate ; Iowa , with the 6th lowest murder rate ; New Hampshire , with the 7th lowest murder rate ; Montana , with the 8th lowest murder rate ; Utah , which has the 9th lowest murder rate ; and Oregon and Massachusetts , which are tied with the 10th lowest murder rate .<-->O
http://www.nospank.net/correlationstudy.htm there is a lack of father figues in the home In the family , there once was a strong male figure that children would fear .<-->O
However , with the increase in single parent families , often consisting of a mother , that figure has gone .<-->N
Children fear nothing these days and the reintroduction of corporal punishment would give them some fear and this would curb disruptive behaviour in the classroom .<-->O
A woman can not realistically be both mother and father no matter how hard she may try .<-->O
Children also realize this and a lot of their acting out is because they feel neglected by their fathers .<-->O
It is not sexist to consider the importance both sets of parents play in a child 's development .<-->N
Just like a father can not be a mother to his kids neither can you expect a mother to be a father to her kids .<-->N
Catering to one role is hard enough as it is .<-->N
The education system can not be a complete substitute for poor parenting , though it has a part to play .<-->O
Schools may complete social instruction , but what we see now is a lack of even it 's most fundamental aspects , and work on repairing this must start in the home , where children learn by example from their parents .<-->O
p.s. that is also sexist - there is no reason a woman can not take the role of the father figure .<-->N
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... other sanctions have no effect It is all well and good those on the sidelines saying that giving children a small wrap on the knuckles is morally outrageous but they are not the ones who witness appalling behaviour in the classroom .<-->O
If you ask the teachers , those on the front line of disruptive students , a recurring comment is that with corporal punishment off the agenda , there are no sanctions available to teachers for the most stubborn of terrors !<-->O
It is true that teachers can not hit children but this was because beforehand , they abused their power on occasions and this can not be tolerated in society .<-->N
The law is there simply to protect the children .<-->N
Clearly if teachers can not get children to behave using correct behavioural techniques and being strict but without punishment physically then clearly they are not as qualified as we once thought to handle children .<-->O
gugug Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... rights culture needs to be impeded Children s behaviour has been adversely affected by the rights culture we have in Britain .<-->O
A teacher can not threaten a detention , something they are allowed to do , without the retort of but you ca n't take away my freedom , you have no right or I have rights .<-->O
In fact children are acutely aware of how much power they have over the teachers by way of laws and rights , and they use every opportunity to remind the teachers of that fact .<-->O
If we re-introduced corporal punishment this back chat would cease and the power would be retained by the teachers .<-->O
And detention is not going to be taken seriously by anyone .<-->N
What does detention do other than waste your time ?<-->N
If you have ADHD or a creative mind you 'll have a blast , effectively learning nothing to * correct * your behavior .<-->O
If this is the only effective authority a teacher has for an out of control student then that teacher is and probably knows his/her authority is rather pitiful .<-->O
Teachers can impose a detention , regards of the child 's retort .<-->N
Teachers * do * have this authority .<-->N
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... it will improve the lives of those who are bullied There is a real feeling amongst those who are bullied that telling the teacher will worsen the problem , not make it better .<-->O
Victims of bullying fear repercussions .<-->N
However , if there was a system of corporal punishment behind the teachers , then something could be done which would scare the bullies out of their bullying ways .<-->O
This would open bully victims up as they would discuss bullying issues with teachers knowing that something definitive could be done .<-->O
If a child thinks it 's okay to hit because a teacher or adult uses corporal punishment then that child is slow and fails to realize the purpose and meaning behind such an action .<-->O
Besides a good and effective teacher is not going to use corporal punishment all the time , but as a last resort when all else fails .<-->O
A threat is no good unless there is some fearful truth behind it .<-->O
Also , teachers are only ignorant to bullying matters because they know they can not realistically do much to stop it .<-->O
So in effect , bullying has gotten a lot meaner .<-->N
Often when nothing is done about bullying it is actually the teachers being ignorant to the goings-on of the playground .<-->O
The teacher could just as easily with that power turn around and strike the bullied child - say for example if they are from a bad background who are not liked by the teacher , yet still bullied by their peers .<-->O
Having authority would not necessarily make teachers do the right thing .<-->O
Often with the authority that they possess now , teachers fail to combat bullying - giving them more will not necessarily solve the issue .<-->O
Actually , when teachers hit , it actually lets the child think that violence is okay and than they take it out on others .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... Asbo 's dont work - swift punishment may prevent bad behaviour later This is a personal view , but I am sure if the cane had been retained in schools the obscene and violent behaviour that too many young peope engage in would not take place today if that behaviour had resulted inthem being punished A exclusion or an asbo is seen as a badge of honour no threat Are teachers not accountable ?<-->O
Sumtimz teechers get too angry and beet them too hardly and due to this the students get ascareded of the teachers to tell something like someone is bullying him/her , some one is speaking bad words .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... it works !<-->N
Corporal punishment is the most effective way of maintaining school discipline and dealing with juvenile crime .<-->O
I went to an inner city co-educational primary school in an industrial area during the late 1950s/early 1960s .<-->N
Academic standards were high .<-->N
Between 30 % and 35 % of its pupils passed the 11 + and went to grammar school .<-->N
Discipline was strict .<-->N
The headmistress caned or slippered boys and girls on the bottom .<-->N
Corporal punishment was used for minor infringements of rules , for deliberate defiance and to prevent prosecution for criminal offences .<-->O
It was more of a deterrent for girls than it was for boys who were always challenging authority and getting into mischief .<-->O
I and three other boys received six of the best for disrupting lessons and refusing to do homework .<-->N
Not wanting to be caned again , we settled down , worked hard and passed the 11 + .<-->N
The school 's major disciplinary problems were caused by ten and eleven year old C stream pupils who lived on a new council housing estate At the beginning of the autumn term , the boys organised playground protection rackets .<-->O
Some carried flick knives or knuckledusters given to them by elder brothers who had been in prison or borstal .<-->N
One teacher was attacked with a broken bottle .<-->N
Although uninjured , he had a nervous breakdown and was away from school for two terms .<-->N
Girls had jam and marmalade rubbed into their hair .<-->N
Both boys and girls had their clothes slashed with flick knives .<-->F
Classrooms were vandalised and on two occasions boys were caught setting fire to coats in the cloakroom .<-->F
At the time children as young as seven could be prosecuted and sent to approved school .<-->N
The head was put under great pressure by the staff and the local authority to involve the police in these incidents but she always refused .<-->N
Unlike many head teachers , she accepted responsibility for her pupils behaviour out of school hours .<-->N
Most weekends she was called to the police station to deal with girls caught shoplifting and boys arrested for assault or vandalism .<-->N
Often the only way she could persuade the victim to withdraw the charges was to agree to cane the delinquents and the punishments were carried out at school with parental consent .<-->O
Using corporal punishment efficiently and effectively , she kept the members of the school s criminal fraternity out of the justice system giving them a chance to escape from their back grounds and make something of their lives .<-->O
One boy who was caned for vandalism obtained a degree in engineering .<-->N
Another who had been whacked for rubbing marmalade into a girl s hair went to university and graduated with a degree in economics .<-->N
Because Dr. Phil is such an expert I guess his expertise is wiser than our ancestors and our elders who have effectively used corporal punishment to discipline their children - our parents and grandparents even .<-->O
If we were to listen to them they would tell us that corporal punishment is not for everybody because some children can be settled with a reprimand and disapproving look .<-->O
That being said , they would still rely on the expediency of the cane because all some of these bad kids need is a good spanking .<-->O
Not to call you old , but the 1950s/1960s was a long time ago .<-->N
As time changes , so do problems and the way you deal with them .<-->O
A recent Dr. Phil show explained the effects of corporal punishment perfectly .<-->N
Some children respond to it but others respond negatively to it .<-->N
If a child really responds negatively to it , then you have a worse problem than you started with .<-->O
Mental illness is much more prevalent today than it was in the 1950s/1960s .<-->O
If a student is acting out due to mental illness and they are punished for it , that will make the mental illness worse .<-->O
If we have a student that is about to become a school shooter , a few smacks is not going to stop them .<-->N
It would just make them more angry and aggressive , if anything .<-->O
Also , culture had become more `` me centered '' .<-->N
People are much more self-centered and selfish now than in the 1950s/1960s .<-->N
It 's a lot more likely now that a teacher will abuse their power than in the 1950s/1960s .<-->O
If a teacher abuses their power , students will be abused .<-->O
This will cause even more trouble than the corporal punishment was suppose to fix .<-->O
Also , a student can falsely claim that they were abused by a teacher .<-->N
This could ruin the teacher 's career and lower the chances of them getting another job .<-->N
I could continue with the problems of corporal punishment but I wo n't for time 's sake .<-->N
There are too many problems for corporal punishments to be brought back in all schools in today 's society .<-->O
Actually yes , if you 're looking for years that far from now , you are probably reallllllly old .<-->N
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... Montaigne I believe in Corporal Punishment .<-->N
It is very effective .<-->N
Yes , it is true that some Principals go way overboard using too much force to where kids get broken bones and sent to the hospital .<-->O
But when I was paddled , it hurt , and there was trust and respect for the principal that I had .<-->O
My parents allowed the principal to paddle me .<-->N
I only was paddled one time .<-->N
I was a very good kid in school .<-->O
I am in my 30 's and still have n't been in trouble .<-->O
The paddle was what saved me from doing wrong .<-->N
I only wish that we could use paddling in our court system too and for adults who do minor things instead of going to jail .<-->O
It would be 5 swats per buttock , male or female .<-->N
Or why not have a robo spanker , which lasts up to 15 minutes and spanks you until your 15 minutes are up . ?<-->N
That is a great idea .<-->N
I would rather have a sting to my butt for a few days than be in jail .<-->O
The economy is hurting .<-->N
The Robo spanker locks your wrists in place you are bent down on a table , and whatever the judge decides on how hard/fast he wants the paddle to swat you would be his choice .<-->O
In 15 minutes , you will think twice on commiting another crime .<-->O
Let me know what you think .<-->O
Thank you .<-->N
contact me at You need to cite facts before attributing corporal punishment to gangs and terrorism .<-->O
Also , try seeing how you 'd react if you did something bad and were spanked by the person you admire and love - the one person you try to impress and one of the few you respect .<-->O
Not only would you cry because of brief pain , but you would cry from shock and shame .<-->O
You , who thought you were above reprimand or reproof had to be corrected by your honored love one .<-->O
If that does not prevent you from repeating the unmentionable act then at least you know that when you 're rotting in jail you had your chance to straighten up - either that or you 're a sociopath .<-->N
Why would we use that in court instead of jail ?<-->N
What type of mature person is afraid of spanks ?<-->N
Jail is more effective anyways -LRB- mostly because of the fear factor -RRB- .<-->O
But what does that have to do with school ?<-->N
The point is that some principles and teachers do go way overboard and hurt the children .<-->N
Then they develop fear and hate .<-->O
And that 's what made terrorism and caused so many hurt and angry teens to join gangs .<-->O
When that happens we know that corporal punishment is not right and causes more damage than it stops .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... The administration of corporal punishment made us grow up to become responsible citizen .<-->N
Breaking a rule at school resulted in corporal punishment being administered .<-->F
We were caned , and that was that .<-->F
No offence was either intended or taken .<-->N
So , we learned to respect the rules , customs and norms of our society .<-->O
Kids are not going to go up against their parents after being subjugated to corporal punishment .<-->N
Also , it is perfectly natural for kids to become rebellious when they reach a certain age .<-->O
The buck stops when that kid has reached that age and has learned nothing .<-->N
When that adolescent gets big enough to try and go up against his/her parents - then that child is no longer a child and needs to leave the protection and shelter of his parents and make his own .<-->O
When Corporal punishment is administered it does n't just blow over .<-->O
kids develop grudges and plot and plan .<-->O
Some join gangs too .<-->N
Also its not effective .<-->N
kids do get rebellious .<-->N
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... It depends on how the actual punishement is administered Assuming the person punishing knows exactly what they are doing and knows how to control themself , there should be no problem with Corporal Punishment at all , the rules of Corporal Punishment would need to be altered , obviously .<-->O
Because as they are they could hurt the child , But if altered it would be perfectly reasonable to administer corporal punishment I would say speak for yourself , or at least what you know .<-->O
If the majority of administered corporal punishment was done incorrectly then the history of child protective services would be a whole lot more radical .<-->O
Corporal punishment has been used by a majority of households and education centers for thousands of years until very recently .<-->N
There will always be those who abuse the system , but that does not mean the system does not work .<-->O
Now that society - at least Western society is claiming to be so much better , or wiser than previous societies then at least it can come up with a more regulated and consistent implementation of such a practice .<-->O
I agree .<-->N
But most of the time the `` punisher '' does not know how to control himself so we have to keep the law in place .<-->O
Majority rules .<-->N
Also if corporal punishment were to be altered to not hurt a child , it would not be called corporal punishmen .<-->N
It has no relation to why you should have corporal punishment the debate topic that we are discussing Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->O
Yes because ... No because ... it makes a direct link between a behavior and its bad consequences today boys and girls ignore the consequences of their behavior .<-->O
They underestimate their responsabilties.Especially when they are teens .<-->N
A lot of bad accident , alcoolism , unexpected pregnancy , etc. . .<-->N
would be avoid if a strict sentence -LRB- i.e. cp -RRB- for misbehavior had been far earlier decided and operated .<-->O
Anticipation , a kind of humiliation and pain are ingredients easy to undrestand ... Corporal punishment does not actually administer a direct cause-and-effect link between a behaviour and its bad consequences .<-->O
It is just as likely that it will create an unwanted association with the presence of the one administering the punishment -LRB- e.g. the parents -RRB- as the bad consequence itself or its cause , contributing to further rebellious or sneaky behaviour , making its effect temporary .<-->O
Education and nonaggressive , impersonal deterrents -LRB- such as educating them about the financial and psychological consequences of teen pregnancy -RRB- are far more effective if you want to show them a direct cause-and-effect relationship .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... It has been made illegal in so many countries for a reason .<-->O
Many countries out-lawed homosexuality , female workers and abortions , but this does not mean that all of those countries were correct to do so .<-->O
It only means that these countries were in agreement against something , it does not mean that what they were all advocating was logical or reasonable .<-->O
The amount of countries that do or do not have corporal punishment out lawed has no bearing on this debate .<-->N
Yet have any of these countries provided effective supports to parents in helping them discipline and punish out-of-control children ?<-->N
They tell parents that corporal punishment in wrong , but when their child acts out or gets in trouble with the law , they blame the parents .<-->O
Is that fair ?<-->N
If they want to outlaw corporal punishment then they need to provide supports that are just as effective in deterrence as corporal punishment for parents and teachers to use .<-->O
Since they have not -LRB- other than waging a war on kids with zero-tolerance laws and imprisonment -RRB- then what right do they have over how a parent disciplines his/her child or wants his/her child to be disciplined by teachers ?<-->O
The only thing I can agree on is providing regulatory law like Section 59 of New Zealand 's Crimes Amendment Act of 2007 , that allows only corporal punishment used for reasonable disciplinary action to legislate against other forms of child hitting or California 's right to discipline laws , to protect against potential abuse .<-->O
Of course , as it applies to parents it should apply to teachers as well .<-->N
Corporal Punishment has now been completely banned in 24 countries : Austria , Bulgaria , Chile , Costa Rica , Croatia , Cyprus , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , Israel , Latvia , Norway , Portugal , Romania , Spain , Sweden , The Netherlands , New Zealand , Ukraine , Uruguay and Venezuela .<-->N
Furthermore , there are numerous countries which are on their way to banning it such as Italy and Nepal , who have forbidden it by the courts but not by law as of yet .<-->N
Corporal punishment is becoming widely discussed all over the world and the consideration to completely ban it is becoming a frequent query .<-->O
Therefore , corporal punishment should not be reintroduced as evidently the fact that so many countries are against it portrays the negativity it brings and the banning of it in so many countries must be for a good reason .<-->O
If there were any doubts all these countries would not have banned it and the UK would not have banned it in schools in the first place !<-->O
To reinstate something which has already been thoroughly discussed years ago and of which the outcome was negative , would be absurd !<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... It increases the rate of crime and violence .<-->N
This argument lacks statistical backing .<-->N
There is a reason for this .<-->N
Because the statistics systematically show that after corporal punishment was made illegal , crime increased , by 67 % .<-->O
The statistics are firmly in favour of the reintroduction of corporal punishment .<-->N
In late 2009 , American psychology professor Marjorie Gunnoe published a report that found that corporal punishment is good for kids - although since she was going against the grain of popular psychology most journals would not publish it .<-->O
Nonetheless , her research was not meant to serve as a green light for parents to spank their children , but rather a red light for those groups who want corporal punishment banned .<-->O
Here are some articles describing her findings : Corporal punishment can be associated with higher rates of aggression , more substance abuse and an increased risk of crime and violence as many victims of corporal punishment tend to lash out and repeat this abuse as they do n't know any better .<-->O
In other words , it teaches children to use physical violence .<-->N
The fact that corporal punishment increases crime and violence has been supported by the American Academy of Paediatrics -LRB- AAP -RRB- which has stated that `` the more children are spanked , the more anger they report as adults , the more likely they are to spank their own children , the more likely they are to approve of hitting a spouse and the more marital conflict they experience as adults . ''<-->O
Hence , corporal punishment not only starts a vicious circle of violence but also affects the childs life and wellbeing once they become an adult .<-->O
The government needs to work towards a less violent society , not increasing the amount of violence in society by reintroducing one of its founders .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... It has negative psychological effects .<-->N
If you speak to people who have been subjected to corporal punishment , they state that it was good for them and taught them discipline .<-->N
If you are going to talk of alcohol dependency then you will have to quantify how many , and also show the link between the corporal punishment and these problems .<-->O
Please provide sources .<-->N
I have never heard of this from anyone who has been spanked .<-->N
Most times they regret they did what they did in the first place to get spanked .<-->N
I have witnessed adults talk about their youth and go up to their parents and thank them for correcting them when they were foolish .<-->O
I 've also heard of some people who were locked up who wished someone had been tougher on them or gave them some more spankings .<-->N
Some of these same inmates have ended up forming closer relationships with their parents , mainly their mothers , because they now realize what their mothers were trying to prevent and feel sorry to have become such a burden .<-->O
A low self-esteem is one of the principle problems brought on by corporal punishment and can result in anxiety difficulties , alcohol dependency , delinquency and insecurity .<-->O
Victims of this physical violence also tend to be more shy and resentful than those who are not subject to physical harm .<-->O
Furthermore , corporal punishment sees the deterioration of the relationship between the victim and the person exercising the violence , whether that be a parent or guardian or a teacher .<-->N
Nevertheless , this means that corporal punishment can ruin the lives of children through its negative psychological effects .<-->N
Additionally , undoubtedly it destroys the rapport of the child with whoever conducts the corporal punishment due to a lack of trust .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... It is wrong and inappropriate .<-->N
So by having this atricle you are stating that parents can not punish their children or teachers can not punish their pupils for misbehaving and causing a disruptance in class rooms and at home ?<-->O
If we all were to follow this article and not punish our children by `` striking the fear of God into them '' as some say how are we supposed to punish the children ?<-->O
Children are already violent already , by not ceasing this to happen and using corporal punishment it will be come a `` living hell '' as my father says .<-->O
I know for a fact cause I was a child at first that slaping a kids hand or grounding them does nothing to cease the problem but makes them more defiant towards rules .<-->O
By doing this how are we supposed to prepare them for the real world because after you make a big mistake the cops are not going to smack you on the hand and put you in the corner .<-->O
NO there will be much bigger concequences .<-->N
So do you want a diciplined next generation or a misbehaving unlawful generation ?<-->N
You tell me ... You do realize that most people who beat their children are doing it because it worked for them when their parents used to beat them as children ?<-->N
Also , what makes the U.N. transcendant and all-knowing .<-->N
I agree with its sentiment , but it is largely mistaken if it thinks that corporal punishment is abuse .<-->O
Abuse kills , corporal punishment does not .<-->N
To discipline or punish a child through physical violence is clearly a violation of the most basic of human rights .<-->O
Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child declares that `` Children and young people have the right to physical and personal integrity .<-->O
All services should ensure that child protection is based on this right and that definitions of abuse do not condone any level of violence to children . ''<-->O
As well as being lawfully wrong , corporal punishment is morally wrong .<-->O
There are plenty of other alternative methods to discipline a child other than beating the child !<-->N
For example , a person can take away the privileges of the child or prevent them from carrying out their hobbies or even insist that they do some other form of work to make up for their bad behaviour .<-->O
Nonetheless , physically harming the child is completely inappropriate and unnecessary .<-->O
Would the conductor of the corporal punishment like it if it were the other way round and it were him/her getting beaten ?<-->N
I think not .<-->N
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... harms children with genuine behavioural disorders or other disabilities I think it obvious that a child would not be introduced into a school without the parents being aware of any behavioural disorders or diabilities .<-->O
What must be taken into account , is a vast majority of cases are attention seeking attempts ; in this case , we are to isolate them .<-->O
Of course , this is used today as a way of dealing with behaviour , but it seems unsuccesful in dealing with behaviour , as people think its cool to go against the system , such as gaining unnecessary ASBOs , or trying to impress friends or admirers .<-->O
I find the most efficient way of dettering bad behaviour , is embarrasment .<-->O
In Islamic counties , they use punishments , such as fingers amputated for stealing , public flogging for being abusive to higher authority or stoning for adultry .<-->O
This is used as a detterance , not only to the person themselves , but to the general public also .<-->N
It also makes an awareness on how foolish those individuals are , for trying to make themselves cooler , or more impressive .<-->O
I am currently a sixth form student at a secondary school -LRB- high school in some cases -RRB- , and i can see that younger years are getting `` cockier '' towards tutors .<-->N
This is a observation of only a few years , whereas the scale we are talking is much longer .<-->N
It is this point , where the point i made earlier on being abusive to authority , where corperal punishment should be reintroduced .<-->O
Sure , children need to learn how to be independant without guidence , and need to learn from their mistakes , but isnt that what corperal punishment was for ?<-->O
Did it not show what will happen , if the individuals did make the wrong decisions ?<-->O
Like i said , corperal punishment showed the consequences of going against higher authority , children need to learn of these consequences , and experience them if they do attempt to go against that authority .<-->O
As of the cases which include genuine behavioural disorders or disabilities , the school should know of these conditions ; thus the right amount of discipline would be administrated .<-->O
As a child with Asperger 's I did a lot of things that were defined as bad behaviour because of panic attacks , repeated bullying or desperation to remove something from the classroom that was against my personal rules/routine .<-->O
there was no way physical punishment would have worked , i just would n't have relented , i would have ended up seriously injured , and i would have been fine if i had been left to work in a room on my own .<-->O
this would be OK if teachers could actually tell the difference between badly behaved children and children with conditions that can be dealt with , but in my experience they ca n't , and often are n't sympathetic anyway .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... Currently legal in 21 states .<-->F
Where is the betterment ?<-->N
I can not comment on the way the sytem works in the USA , as i live in the UK , but what we must remember , is corperal punishment is for the individuals that are misbehaving .<-->O
Corporal punishment was not directed to every single child under education , so you can not raise that point .<-->N
It is true , that corporal punishment has religious origins , but it must be noted that in the eyes of religion , it is to make them a better christian , muslim ect .<-->O
What i feel is important , is every -LRB- if not , most -RRB- country is based upon religious origins .<-->O
South America was colonized by spain in 1492 , and North America 's Eastern seaboard was colonized by the English ; at those times , both were devout Christian Countries -LRB- please keep in mind , i am not attacking North and South America .<-->O
Im just using them as examples -RRB- .<-->N
As for the question , `` are we seeing measurable difference in behavior in this states to justify reintroducing it in states that have banned it ? ''<-->N
, once again , i can not comment .<-->N
But i do understand that American States have the independance to choose their own laws , and agree that they should .<-->O
If you were to look for a measurable difference , look at the difference of age and behaviour .<-->O
In the case of the UK , bad behaviour in younger years are always increasing , and i feel that is because UK has made corporal pubnishment illegal .<-->O
I can not comment on USA 's younger generation , but im sure someone can .<-->N
People that are considering this topic should listen too the TED talk by Sam Harris : Can science answer Moral Questions Here is a a part of the talk that is relevant to this debate : . ''<-->O
... there are 21 states in our country -LRB- the U.S.A. -RRB- where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal : where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .<-->O
And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .<-->N
The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .<-->O
We 're not talking about Connecticut .<-->N
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .<-->N
The Creator of the universe Himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child : This is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .<-->O
But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?<-->O
-LRB- Laughter -RRB- Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ? ''<-->N
So , the point to `` re-introduce '' is mute .<-->N
The question becomes : are we seeing measurable difference in behavior in this states to justify reintroducing it in states that have banned it ? .<-->N
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... old corp ???????????? Old Corp frustrated and afraid i grow our society in decline discipline , personal responsibility only few adhere to how far must the pendulum swing is this when , enough is enough !<-->O

at a loss i am ... Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... I think corpral punishment should be eleagle in every country .<-->N
Honestly , It depends on how the punishment is administered .<-->N
You ca n't just go on about how bad it is by using uninteresting adjectives .<-->O
- You spelt Illegal wrong , You also spelt Legal wrong - Thats cause there was no discipline at that school .<-->N
Speaks volumes .<-->N
Corpral punishment is tereible .<-->N
The only thing it does is ruin children and make them grow snappy , rude , mean , lonely , and depressed .<-->O
If you think corpral punishment should be leagle again , than you are either insensitive , mean , or you are just plain stupid .<-->O
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... It brings fear in the person This presumes that it is used both often and by the same person .<-->N
If used in school and only rarely it is quite possible that any one individual getting a reputation for giving a caning could be avoided .<-->O
Moreover this is not always a bad thing if the person is afraid of being punished then the answer is to make sure that they know what they are doing wrong and they will avoid it .<-->O
this brings fear becuase if the person inflicting the pain on the person keeps on doing it any time the individual who as being suffering from it sees the inflicter he or she turns to be afriad Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->O
Yes because ... No because ... it makes the victim hardend So does prison , but you do n't see anyone arguing for getting rid of that .<-->N
cos if u keep on imflictin da pain he or she will be used to it and will know dat u will do the same thing so he she keeps on being bad and wen u keep on beating him or her they wont care so will keep on duin naughty things Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->O
Yes because ... No because ... it can lead to death Causing death by beating is illegal regardless of whether it is ` punishment ' .<-->O
Technically , anything can lead to death if used in excession .<-->N
This isnt much of a valid point .<-->O
If someone ate too much yoghurt they would die , If someone were to run and run for ages without sleep or eating or stopping they would die .<-->O
Id someone were to sit there doing nothing , absolutely nothing , they would die .<-->N
This is n't much or an argument .<-->N
Corporal punishment is not abuse and will not lead to death .<-->O
Abuse , however will lead to death .<-->O
If you have crossed the line you will definitely know because there is a brief time limit to all corporal punishment , and there is really one sort of instrument that can be used -LRB- which can not kill -RRB- , and is applied to a limited amount of areas .<-->O
Neither of these things can kill a child when used together .<-->N
These things also wo n't leave bruises or broken ribs .<-->N
Of course , marks may be left but they usually fade with no bruising in a day or so .<-->N
Yes , I agree now .<-->N
Corporal Punishment should be reintroduced .<-->N
Yes because ... No because ... For children , actions speak louder than words .<-->N
Children usually learn by observing role models and imitating them .<-->N
Especially younger ones who do not fully understand the abstract moral concepts -LRB- empty words -RRB- behind the punishments , making them reliant to whoever the nearest role model is .<-->O
Thus when you hit children very often they 're at risk of thinking that morality only exists if you get caught/punished and if you 're all grown up it 's fine to hit smaller and powerless people .<-->O
And corporal punishment does not work especially to those children who are too predisposed to violence and alienation , such as sociopaths .<-->O
If anything you 're just encouraging them on how to take their own personal grudges onto other people and justify them with empty words .<-->O
I personally do not see a beneficial relation corporal punishment has with constructive parental modeling .<-->O
-------------- My post about why dodgeball should be banned in schools has been very popular on Geek Alabama with many people not agreeing with me , I mean that is fine .<-->O
But I don t think students should be throwing something to hit other students .<-->N

http://geekalabama.com/2013/03/28/why-dodgeball-should-be-banned-in-schools/ If you think banning dodgeball is controversial , wait until I talk about the next thing I want banned from schools , it s corporal punishment .<-->O
Let the controversies begin !<-->N
Corporal Punishment is banned in mental institutions , prisons , and in the US Military .<-->N
But somehow , this abusive form of punishment is still allowed in schools in 19 states that are mostly Republican led .<-->O
The reasons why I think spanking should be banned is simple , no other adult should have permission to touch another student in the private parts , that includes the buttocks .<-->O
There are plenty of videos on YouTube of some teachers that go way too far and leave bruises and cuts on the buttocks after corporal punishment is administered .<-->N
And think about this , most countries around the world have banned corporal punishment from their schools .<-->N
But somehow , the United States still allows this punishment .<-->N
Why is that ?<-->N
Is the Federal Government and the US Congress too afraid the Christian , Bible leading people will kick them out of office if they banned spanking ?<-->O
Some people will point to the Bible to a passage that says spare the rod , spoil the child .<-->O
But like some things you read in the Bible , some things are too archaic for today s society .<-->O
I think it is high time for all schools to ban corporal punishment once and for all !<-->N
Spanking is abusive to the kids and some adults will go full throttle on the kids while spanking on the buttocks .<-->O
I mean , who wants to be spanked by a paddle like this , it s too abusive .<-->O
Yes , bullying in schools is an epidemic problem .<-->N
But there are better ways to punish a child than to spank them .<-->O
Now , the parents of the kids can do whatever they want and if they feel spanking is good , then they can do it .<-->O
But , I wish those parents would voluntary end spanking .<-->O
Many studies have shown that corporal punishment is bad for the child s mental health .<-->N
And think about this , what kids are most likely to be spanked in schools , it is minority students and special needs students .<-->O
That s not right!A Leeds Alabama mother has started an online petition urging reintroduction and passage of a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy , D-New York , that would ban corporal punishment from all schools in the United States .<-->N
Schools should be a safe and fun learning environment for all students .<-->O
Adults , administrators , and teachers in schools should never allow violence and humiliation on any student !<-->O
Think about it , what if you were beaten with a paddle and humiliated by other adults , you would not think very well would you .<-->O
That s why corporal punishment should be banned from schools .<-->N
I hope that happens!I would like to talk to about the current debate on whether schools should go back to the old system of corporal punishment or not .<-->O
Unfortunately , I have not had very long to write this essay -LRB- two days -RRB- , but it is all based on direct knowledge .<-->O
I was apparently harassing other pupils .<-->N
This is actually wrong as first of all , it was only one pupil , and secondly , it was n't harassing but having fun .<-->O
The pupil -LRB- who will remain anonymous -RRB- did n't really mind it , but he never had a say in the matter , neither did I and the other harassers , although we were the apparent ones who were causing the problem .<-->O
What is corporal punishment ?<-->N
Corporal Punishment , as described by the Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus -LRB- in one volume - 1990 -RRB- is the punishment of a physical nature such as caning .<-->N
This was in the schools in the UK quite a long time ago , and some people have been wondering whether it was a good thing , and to re-introduce it , or was it a bad thing .<-->O
At the moment in schools , you would usually get told off , or if it is more serious , you may be told to so something such as a five hundred word essay -LRB- or if it was not as bad -LRB- like mine -RRB- , it may be just a letter or apology to teachers , prefects and other people -RRB- on a subject related to the illegal deed you have done .<-->O
In a school which has corporal punishment , you may be caned on the hand or on the anus .<-->N
At present , in schools this would be illegal , but then , it was quite common .<-->O
In schools , what tends to happen is that you may be caught by a number of people , and new technologies enable the people to be able to record your name more accurately and securely .<-->O
Some of the people who may catch you include : prefects , teachers , other people telling teachers , sixth formers and more .<-->N
If you are caught , you may be asked to have some sort of x word essay -LRB- which is usually in excess of two hundred , often about five hundred - can be more if you have been extremely naughty -RRB- , on a subject which is relevant to what you have done which is wrong .<-->O
This would often be done if it is directly causing some damage to the victim , -LRB- whether directly or indirectly -RRB- .<-->N
Normally , the person who caught you would talk to the person/people who were causing the damage - by usually giving them a warning -LRB- which I was n't given -RRB- - and if they continue doing the deed , then they would have some disciplinary action .<-->O
This would be handed into the school office , form tutors , key stage managers and sometimes it may be put into your pupil 's file .<-->N
The person who caught you would also talk to the person whom the damage was being caused to , and only if they found that the people who were hurting him/her -LRB- whether verbally or physically -RRB- , would the punishment be issued .<-->O
The person/people who were causing the problem may also be causing damage to many people -LRB- for example , racism -RRB- .<-->O
In this case , the person who was causing the problem would often be given a worse sentence , which may consist of more lines , for example , or if it was very bad , they would be suspended .<-->O
In a corporal school , this person would be either suspended or even expelled !<-->N
They would also be given some sort of physical punishment -LRB- eg .<-->N
caning -RRB- by the teacher or person who caught them .<-->N
I have not had enough time to learn about how the school system worked in corporal punishment schools , so I can not comment on whether they had such things as prefects .<-->O
Many people think that the corporal punishment schools made pupils better behaved and enabled then to be better at schoolwork because if they got a low mark -LRB- even in some cases nine out of ten -RRB- , they would be punished until they got full marks .<-->O
I personally do not think that corporal punishment should be re-introduced into schools for the sole reason that I would not like to be caned or similar .<-->O
I have not had enough time to interview other people to think what they think so my views would be completely biased .<-->O
Parents may think that it should be re-introduced into schools because they think that children now do not spend enough time on their homework or any assignments that they have been set , but if they had the choice for them to re-live their life with the choice of whether or whether not corporal punishment , I think that most if not all of them would go for the non-corporal punishment option .<-->O
Even if the majority of people thought that corporal punishment should be reintroduced in schools , I very much doubt that it will actually happen .<-->O
Firstly , I do n't think it would be worth the change , and I 'm sure the government would agree with me , and secondly that even nowadays it is actually illegal for parents to hit their children , the teachers/guardians/prefects etc. will not be able to hit children who are not even in the same family .<-->O
I believe that there should be some sort of punishment if the person has been naughty in any way , but I do n't believe that the person who was naughty should be physically abused .<-->O
The government will not go through the process of changing every school in the UK to allow them to hit the children in the school .<-->N
It would not be worth the hassle and will cost millions of pounds for this to take off , and the government does not have that amount of money to waste ; it could go towards things which would benefit more from all of the money given .<-->O
That 's it !<-->N
Corporal punishment is a physical punishment in which pain is deliberately inflicted on a perpetrator of a wrong in order to exact retribution and to deter similar behavior in future .<-->O
An accepted form of discipline through the ages , it has been upheld by all the Abrahamic religions , and has been practiced in some form in almost every human civilization .<-->N
Corporal punishment was for a long time considered an appropriate method for disciplining children in schools .<-->N
The birch rod was once a fixture of the schoolhouse .<-->N

The punishment is usually administered either across the buttocks -LSB- 1 -RSB- or on the hands , -LSB- 2 -RSB- with an implement specially kept for the purpose such as a rattan cane , wooden paddle , slipper , leather strap or wooden yardstick .<-->N
Less commonly , it could also include spanking or smacking the student in a deliberate manner on a specific part of the body with the open hand , especially at the elementary school level .<-->O
Advocates of school corporal punishment argue that it provides an immediate response to indiscipline and that the student is quickly back in the classroom learning , rather than being suspended from school .<-->O
Opponents argue that physical punishment is ineffective in the long term , interferes with learning , produces numerous harmful side effects , and is a form of violence that violates the rights of children .<-->O

The Supreme Court of the United States has not yet judged the practice under other federal law or other Constitutional clauses .<-->N
Paddling continues to be used to a significant extent in a number of Southern states , though there has been a sharp decline in its incidence over the past 20 years .<-->O

-LSB- 21 -RSB- The late Swiss psychologist and author Alice Miller disputed corporal punishment 's educational value in a letter to First Lady Laura Bush , saying , `` Spanking creates fear .<-->O
In a state of fear the children 's attention is totally absorbed by the strategy of surviving and is not available for absorbing positive messages about the right behavior .<-->O
Thus , children do n't learn from our words but rather from what we are doing to them .<-->O
As they learn through imitation , they learn from us violence and hypocrisy '' .<-->O

-LSB- 3 -RSB- Peter Newell assumes that perhaps the most influential writer on the subject was the English philosopher John Locke , whose Some Thoughts Concerning Education explicitly criticised the central role of corporal punishment in education .<-->O
Locke 's work was highly influential , and may have helped influence Polish legislators to ban corporal punishment from Poland 's schools in 1783 .<-->N
Today , the ban of corporal punishment in all forms is vested in Constitution of Poland -LSB- 111 -RSB- -LSB- 112 -RSB- -LSB- 113 -RSB- RussiaEdit Banned in 1917 .<-->N

-LSB- 116 -RSB- At the secondary and post-secondary level , the rattan strokes are always delivered to the student 's buttocks , and never on the bare buttocks .<-->N
The Ministry of Education has stipulated a maximum of six strokes per occasion .<-->F
In some cases the punishment is carried out in front of the rest of the school instead of in private .<-->F
South AfricaEdit The use of corporal punishment in schools was prohibited by the South African Schools Act , 1996 .<-->F
According to section 10 of the act : -LRB- 1 -RRB- No person may administer corporal punishment at a school to a learner .<-->N

In other private schools , it was banned in 1999 -LRB- England and Wales -RRB- , 2000 -LRB- Scotland -RRB- and 2003 -LRB- Northern Ireland -RRB- .<-->N
-LSB- 4 -RSB- In 1993 , the European Court of Human Rights held in Costello-Roberts v. UK that giving a seven-year-old boy three ` whacks ' with a gym shoe over his trousers was not a forbidden degrading treatment .<-->O
-LSB- 127 -RSB- The implement used in many state and private schools in England and Wales was a flexible rattan cane , applied either to the student 's hands or -LRB- especially in the case of teenage boys -RRB- to the seat of the trousers .<-->O
Slippering was widely used as a less formal alternative .<-->N
In a few English cities , a strap was used instead of the cane .<-->N
-LSB- 128 -RSB- In Scotland a leather strap , the tawse , administered to the palms of the hands , was universal in state schools , -LSB- 129 -RSB- but some private schools used the cane .<-->N
-LSB- 130 -RSB- In 2005 there was an unsuccessful challenge to prohibition of corporal punishment in the Education Act 1996 s. 548 by headmasters of private Christian schools .<-->N
They claimed that it was a breach of their freedom of religion under Article 9 ECHR -LRB- see R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment , ex p Williamson -RRB- .<-->N
A 2008 poll of 6,162 UK teachers by the Times Educational Supplement found that one in five teachers would still back the use of caning in extreme cases .<-->O
-LSB- 131 -RSB- -LSB- 132 -RSB- United StatesEdit See also : Paddle -LRB- spanking -RRB- In the United States , corporal punishment in public schools is governed by official regulations laid down by governments or local education authorities , defining such things as the implement to be used , the number of strokes that may be administered , which members of staff may carry it out , and whether parents must be informed or consulted .<-->O
Depending on how narrowly the regulations are drawn and how rigorously enforced , this has the effect of making the punishment a structured ceremony that is legally defensible in a given jurisdiction and of inhibiting staff from lashing out on the spur of the moment .<-->N
-LSB- 133 -RSB- Individual US states have the power to ban corporal punishment in their schools .<-->N
Currently , it is banned in public schools in 31 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .<-->N
-LSB- 134 -RSB- In two of these states , New Jersey -LSB- 135 -RSB- and Iowa , -LSB- 136 -RSB- it is illegal in private schools as well .<-->N
The 19 states that have not banned it are in the South and , to a lesser extent , the Mid-West .<-->N
It is still used to a significant -LRB- though declining -RRB- -LSB- 137 -RSB- degree in some public schools in Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , Oklahoma , Tennessee and Texas .<-->O
-LSB- 134 -RSB- In 1867 New Jersey became the first U.S. state to abolish corporal punishment in schools .<-->N
The second was Massachusetts 104 years later in 1971 .<-->N
The most recent state to outlaw school corporal punishment was New Mexico in 2011 .<-->N
Private schools in every state but New Jersey and Iowa are exempt from state bans and may choose to use the paddle .<-->N
Here too , most of those which actually do so are to be found in Southern states .<-->O
These are largely Christian evangelical or fundamentalist schools .<-->N
-LSB- 133 -RSB- -LSB- 138 -RSB- -LSB- 139 -RSB- Most urban public school systems , even in states where it is permitted , have abolished corporal punishment .<-->N
Statistics collected by the federal government show that the use of the paddle has been declining steadily , in all states where it is used , over at least the past 20 years .<-->O
The anti-spanking campaign Center for Effective Discipline , extrapolating from federal statistics , estimates that the number of students spanked or paddled in 2006 in U.S. public schools was about 223,000 .<-->N
-LSB- 137 -RSB- Statistics show that black and Hispanic students are more likely to be paddled than white students , -LSB- 137 -RSB- possibly because minority-race parents are more inclined to approve of it .<-->O
-LSB- 140 -RSB- -LSB- 141 -RSB- However , a study in Kentucky found that minority students were disproportionately targeted by discipline policies generally , not only corporal punishment .<-->N
-LSB- 142 -RSB- Federal statistics consistently show that around 80 % of school paddlings in the U.S. are of boys .<-->N
This is most commonly thought to be because boys , more often than girls , exhibit the kinds of misbehaviour for which corporal punishment is thought appropriate .<-->O
-LSB- 143 -RSB- One study has alleged that students with disabilities are `` subjected to corporal punishment at disproportionately high rates , approximately twice the rate of the general student population in some States '' .<-->N
-LSB- 144 -RSB- Corporal punishment in American schools is administered to the seat of the student 's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle .<-->N
-LSB- 133 -RSB- This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway , but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal 's office .<-->F
-LSB- 133 -RSB- Most public school districts lay down detailed rules as to how the punishment is to be administered .<-->F
In many cases these are published in the school 's student-parent handbook .<-->N
-LSB- 133 -RSB- In 1983 a school administrator struggled with a student , trying to force her to bend over a chair to receive a paddling .<-->N
During the struggle , the student fell against a desk , sustaining a serious injury to her back .<-->O
-LSB- 145 -RSB- Increasingly , corporal punishment in US schools is , either explicitly or de facto , a matter of choice for the student .<-->N
Thus , the rules of the Alexander City Schools provide , `` No student is required to submit to corporal punishment . ''<-->N
-LSB- 146 -RSB- Many school handbooks provide that where a student refuses to submit to a paddling , he or she will receive some other punishment instead , such as suspension .<-->N
Students are unlikely nowadays to be forcibly restrained while being paddled , as happened in the 1970 case which came to the Supreme Court in 1977 as Ingraham v. Wright , -LSB- 147 -RSB- where the Court deemed the punishment constitutionally permissible , holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment does not apply to disciplinary corporal punishment in public schools and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not offended by the Florida scheme .<-->O
Many school districts also offer parents an opportunity to state whether or not they wish corporal punishment to be used on their sons and daughters .<-->O
Typically , the parents fill out a form which is filed in the school office .<-->N
In many districts this is an `` opt-out '' system .<-->N
In others an `` opt-in '' system applies , whereby no student is so punished without explicit parental consent .<-->O
A bill to end the use of corporal punishment in schools was introduced into the United States House of Representatives in June 2010 during the 111th Congress .<-->N
-LSB- 148 -RSB- -LSB- 149 -RSB- The bill , H.R. 5628 , -LSB- 150 -RSB- was referred to the United States House Committee on Education and Labor where it was not brought up for a vote .<-->F
As of June 2011 a similar bill has not been re-introduced in the 112th Congress .<-->N
A previous bill `` to deny funds to educational programs that allow corporal punishment '' -LSB- 151 -RSB- was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991 by Representative Major R. Owens .<-->O
That bill , H.R. 1522 , did not become law .<-->N
According to the Alliance Against Corporal Punishment , 72 % of Americans surveyed are against corporal punishment in schools .<-->N
While only 26 % of Americans support school corporal punishment .<-->N

This right includes a non-violent education and upbringing ... Consequently , all forms of physical and humiliating punishment are prohibited '' .<-->O
-LSB- 156 -RSB- In my schooldays corporal punishment was used as part of our education , it kept us in line , if you were foolish to step out of line you would face the strap , school is for learning and not a kindergarten where you can waste teachers time by bieng disruptive , we all n-knew of the concequenses if we did , anything from 2 to 6 -LSB- 3 on each hand -RSB- was possible .<-->O
Still remember most parents voted to keep it , but those who wanted to abolish it won the day , then parents were banned from using it .<-->N
So where are we now , still with problems of unruly kids that need strict disciplin either at school or at home .<-->O
When i was young disciplin began at home , unruly behaviour resulted in the cane bieng used , did me no harm , it meant learning the hard way , also at school where i was strapped on 3 occasions .<-->O
With all due respect , and I mean this from a sincere position as one who also suffered the wrath of nuns before it was outlawed , if they had spent more time educating you , and less time beating you , your spelling , grammer , and punctuation might be a bit better.However , having written that , I also support your position to a certain degree .<-->O
We do have a severe discipline issue with our kids these days and much of it might be attributed to the whole `` spare the rod '' syndrome -LRB- which is n't actually in the Holy Bible , by the way ... -RRB- .<-->O
But not all of it .<-->N
Much of the problem now-a-days is an issue of over stimulation due to technology becoming all at once profoud , powerful , and cheap.And lastly there is the issue of evolution both societally and genetically .<-->O
At some point , surely you dream is of a world without any violence at all ... yes?We do have a severe discipline issue with our kids these days and much of it might be attributed to the whole `` spare the rod '' syndrome -LRB- which is n't actually in the Holy Bible , by the way ... -RRB- .<-->O
But not all of it .<-->N
Much of the problem now-a-days is an issue of over stimulation due to technology becoming all at once profoud , powerful , and cheap.Although I agree with you outright , we have a seperate issue concerning the use of technology .<-->O
Ironically , it is why I spelled `` grammar '' incorrectly in my first post .<-->N
Simply put , we have come to rely heavily upon technology to teach things at a more advanced rate in schools , which has the opposite of its intended effect .<-->N
Instead of putting more useful information into the heads of our young and passing along trouble shooting skills , critical thinking skills , memorization and concentration skills , etc. .<-->O
we put little super-computers in their hands and teach them how to look things up quickly .<-->N
`` So ? ''<-->N
, one might ask .<-->N
`` Why do n't we go back to teaching those skills and forcing kids to learn things the long slow ways we did 50 years ago ? ''<-->O
The simple answer is that the amount of information we need them to process and find relevance in is so far greater than our times tables or hisorical meme jingles were back then .<-->O
They would n't be able to pass high shcool until something like 18th grade .<-->O
They 'd be just entering college at the age of 24 .<-->N
They would n't be professionally or academically useful until they were in their 30 's .<-->N
There 'd just be too much for the average person to ingest .<-->O
However , again , we come back to the original issue because it also widely known that the better education one receives as well as the lower the level of violence in their youth , the more likely they are to become more useful citizens and participate in little to no criminal / violent activity .<-->O
And by `` better education '' I mean philisophically more profound , ideologically more consistent , informationally more correct , and ultimately more socially and personally empowering .<-->O
Take the time to find a way to incorporate the teaching of these skills into our faster paced , more informationally packed school years and then we 'll be much closer to solving discipline issues while not limiting our future students.I was a bit of a rebel at school , more times in the Headmisstreses study than others , maybe a way of getting away from lessons , maybe got used to holding out my hand for the strap , I did learn in the end just before it was to late , in my 4th year when i was 14 got in to a right fight with another girl that nearly got me expelled , but my mother intervened by promising to take mor action at home so i was given 6 , 3 on each hand along with the other girl as we were both equally to blame in the end .<-->O
that evening i was strongly reprimanded by my mother that any further misconduct at school or at home and hoped that the threat of the cane would mend my ways , in a way i suppose it did , even though i did get it for silly things like smoking , calling my mother names izna temper , under age drinking along with my 16 year old sister -LCB- caught by my parents who came home earlier than expected -RCB- pbobably justified .<-->O
Yes school is about learning ; but is inflicting corporal punishment more effective than simply excluding those who are disruptive ?<-->O
However I should also point out that there is some evidence that children perform less well in schools that use corporal punishment .<-->O
According to the author of a study into the effect of corporal punishment on learning `` This study demonstrates that corporal punishment does not teach children how to behave or improve their learning , '' Prof. Talwar said .<-->O
`` In the short term , it may not have any negative effects ; but if relied upon over time it does not support children 's problem-solving skills , or their abilities to inhibit inappropriate behaviour or to learn .<-->O
`` So where exactly are we ?<-->N
In 1843 Lord Ashley in the Commons declared `` the morals of the children are tenfold worse than formerly '' .<-->N
This can be seen in almost all historical times ; it was always better before and kids are much more unruly now .<-->O
It may be true that the youth were all good as gold back in Roman times and there has been a steady decline since then but it seems unlikely.I think that corporal punishment is tantamount or similar to child abuse , fosters a violent , unhealthy environment for a child to grow in .<-->O
Furthermore , I found that corporal punishment has also side effect for children in their coming life ; not only of its bad influence but it can lead a villainy of a child .<-->N
As a result , I believe that corporal punishment should be illegal and ban .<-->O
Point A : Spanking your children reflects how violent or cruel you are .<-->N
The first issue of this problem is spanking .<-->N
Nowadays parents like to beat their kids rather than telling them what is the right thing to do .<-->O
Infact , the more you hit your child the more aggressive and violent behavior they would be and the more chances of being violent .<-->O
Community-health-sciences professor Catherine Taylor says , `` The odds of a child being more aggressive at age 5 increased by 50 % if he had been spanked more than twice in the month before the study began . ''<-->N
So , parents this point should be clear to you , don t be so violent with your kid because it can effect their mentality behavior .<-->O
Point B : Violence in School After being beaten up by parents ; school is the second place to suffer .<-->N
Few years ago , the severity against the students strike when the teachers used many harmful tools to bit them instead of advising them because his/her students misbehavior .<-->O
Because of the harshness scandal , student -LRB- especially highschoolers -RRB- became gradually violent and may effect their younger ones .<-->O
Unfortunately , this issue had been disbanded but the effect of student violent may still have traces .<-->N
Point C : Several countries have already banned corporal punishment in schools .<-->N
Is it good or not ?<-->N
Those government who disbanded the corporal punishment for students are actually right because if they won t banned this punishment , there ll be more chances of child abuse and violence .<-->O
And those government who still possess this policy will undergo many obstacles for their future life .<-->N
I do n't agree to reintroduce the corporal punishment to school .<-->N
I absolutely believe that corporal punishment is n't the good way to educate students .<-->O
it is even not an education , but something bad which is forbidden to be made at schools .<-->O
school is the place where we get an education , not corporal punishment .<-->N
but it does n't mean that I disagree with punishment .<-->O
i strongly believe that punishment must go on .<-->O
Giving punishment is also the way to educate .<-->N
I 've been grateful if the corporal punishment disappear at school .<-->N
Because I myself do n't want to see it appears anymore .<-->N
teachers should find another way to educate .<-->N
but , if it 's gon na be reintroduced at school , It 'll personally be a nightmare for me Many people , even within the USA , think corporal punishment -LRB- `` CP '' -RRB- has long disappeared from all American public schools .<-->O
This is not so .<-->N
The US Supreme Court ruled in 1977 that the spanking or paddling of students by school officials or teachers is lawful , where it has not been explicitly outlawed by local authorities .<-->N
That decision still stands .<-->N
The incidence of CP has declined sharply in recent years , but only 31 states -LRB- plus D.C. and Puerto Rico -RRB- have abolished it in public schools , either de facto or de jure .<-->N
CP is still permitted in the other 19 states , and it remains a widespread practice in three of them , all in the South : Alabama , Arkansas and Mississippi .<-->N
It is also routine , but only in a minority of -LRB- often rural or small-town -RRB- schools , in six more states : Georgia , Louisiana , Missouri , Oklahoma , Tennessee and Texas .<-->N
In the other ten paddling states , the incidence of CP is nowadays close to negligible , as a proportion of school enrollment : Arizona , Colorado , Florida , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Wyoming .<-->N
The latest states to abolish were Delaware , in 2003 , after an eight-year gap in which no abolitions took place at state level ; Pennsylvania , in 2005 ; Ohio , in 2009 ; and New Mexico , in 2011 .<-->N
The number of paddlings had already fallen to a low level in these states .<-->N
On the other hand , efforts to ban school CP by legislation have failed in 2003 in Wyoming and repeatedly in Missouri , and also in North Carolina in 2007 , Louisiana in 2009 and Texas in 2011 .<-->N
Legislative attempts to reintroduce CP in California -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , Montana -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , Iowa -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and , more ambiguously , Oregon -LRB- 1999 -RRB- were fairly easily defeated .<-->N
Also rejected were a 2007 bill to make it easier to spank students in Kansas and a 2013 bill in Oklahoma to restore CP rights to individual class teachers -LRB- as opposed to school principals or administrators , for whom it remains lawful -RRB- .<-->O
A US Supreme Court ruling in 1975 -LRB- Baker vs Owen -RRB- held that schools could spank students against the wishes of their parents , subject to various criteria being met .<-->O
But in 2011 , laws were introduced in both Texas and North Carolina giving parents the right to exempt their sons or daughters from any CP provisions , typically by filling out a form provided .<-->N
It is not yet known what effect , if any , these new laws are having on the incidence of paddling in Texas : many school districts had already adopted that policy anyway .<-->N
In North Carolina the number of districts retaining CP was already very small , according to this July 2011 news report .<-->N
This map appeared in the Chattanooga Times Free Press in October 2013 -LRB- read the whole article here -RRB- .<-->N
Note that all the above refers only to public schools .<-->N
Paddling in private schools -- lawful in all but two states , and common in some southern states , especially in Christian schools -- is not reported in any statistics .<-->N
According to rough estimates from the federal Department of Education -LRB- Office of Civil Rights -RRB- , about 200,000 students were paddled in public schools in the 2009/10 school year .<-->N
This was down from 225,000 four years previously , continuing a decades-long decline .<-->N
The following table gives estimates by state for 2009/10 : State Number of students receiving CP Percentage of total students Alabama 29,956 4.0 % Arizona 879 0.1 % Arkansas 24,490 5.2 % Florida 4,256 0.2 % Georgia 15,944 1.0 % Indiana 524 0.1 % Kansas 225 0.1 % Kentucky 1,284 0.2 % Louisiana 10,201 1.5 % Mississippi 41,130 8.4 % Missouri 4,984 0.6 % North Carolina 1,062 0.1 % Oklahoma 11,135 1.7 % South Carolina 765 0.1 % Tennessee 16,603 1.7 % Texas 36,752 0.8 % The figures for Colorado , Idaho and Wyoming were too small to count .<-->N
Note that these are numbers of students paddled , not numbers of paddlings .<-->N
The total number of paddlings will have been a little higher , since a few students receive corporal punishment on more than one occasion in a school year .<-->O
Mississippi is now the `` world capital of paddling '' in both percentage and absolute terms , having pulled ahead of Texas , which previously had the highest number of students spanked -LRB- though not a high percentage figure ; this is simply because Texas , with nearly 5 million school students , is so big -RRB- .<-->O
If this survey is to be believed , the number of students paddled in Texas had declined by no less than 28 % in the latest period reported .<-->N
Mississippi already led the field by quite some distance as a proportion of students enrolled , and that is even more true now .<-->O
The figures for Texas disguise sharp differences between different areas .<-->N
The state has over 1,000 public school districts .<-->N
Most of these are very small by the standards of the rest of the world , often consisting of just one high school , one middle school and one or two elementary schools .<-->O
These are found in rural or small-town communities -LRB- of which Texas has an enormous number -RRB- , where there tends to be strong local and parental support for spanking .<-->O
At the other end of the scale , most major urban areas in Texas have abolished CP , including all the big cities , such as Fort Worth -LRB- in 1999 -RRB- , Houston -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , and Dallas -LRB- 2005 -RRB- .<-->O
As a result , although over 80 % of districts use the paddle , these account for only 40 % of the students .<-->N
To put it another way , some 60 % of Texas students attend schools in the 20 % of districts where it is banned .<-->F
-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- S. Phillips , The demographics of corporal punishment in Texas , University of North Texas , May 2012 .<-->N
According to one report , paddlings in Mississippi actually increased between 2006/07 and 2008/09 , from 47,727 to 57,953 , a very remarkable bucking of the trend if it is true .<-->O
These statistics come from the state 's own Department of Education and relate to the number of corporal punishment incidents , so they do not tally with those collected by the federal authorities , which count number of students paddled .<-->N
Anyway , an April 2013 news report claims that this figure declined in 2011/12 to 39,000 .<-->N
Such wild variations seem unlikely , and one should probably regard all these statistics with some suspicion .<-->O
Mississippi has 151 school districts , 99 of which use CP , according to the same news item .<-->N
All the federal Department of Education figures , too , should be treated as approximate estimates at best , since they are extrapolated from only a proportion of districts .<-->O
But they should get more accurate over time as the DOE has now -LRB- from 2011/12 -RRB- begun surveying all schools , rather than just a sample .<-->O
Note also that some observers think all such data understate the real incidence of CP , citing anecdotal evidence that some , maybe many , punishments go unrecorded , though this is probably less true than it once was .<-->O
There is a steady stream of news items about individual school districts within paddling states deciding to abandon CP .<-->N
Against the overall declining trend , though , there are occasional reports of districts which had abandoned the paddle deciding to bring it back .<-->O
Both phenomena can be seen in these examples from July 2013 .<-->N
Modus operandi .<-->F
Corporal punishment in US schools is almost invariably applied with a wooden paddle across the student 's clothed posterior , after removing anything found in the back pockets .<-->N
Very occasionally the implement may be of a different material , such as perspex -LRB- Plexiglass -RRB- or polycarbonate -LRB- Lexan -RRB- .<-->N
Paddles come in many shapes and sizes -- see these pictures .<-->F
A typical punishment nowadays consists of two or three strokes , typically referred to as `` swats '' or `` licks '' or occasionally `` pops '' or `` cracks '' .<-->N
In American English the procedure is often described as `` spanking '' , even though an implement is nearly always used .<-->N
-LRB- In this article , the terms `` paddling '' and `` spanking '' are used interchangeably . -RRB-<-->N
In the past it was the norm in some schools to require the culprit to present his bottom for discipline by standing clear of any furniture and bending down as low as possible , often with feet placed well apart for stability : `` Grab your ankles '' was a familiar command -LRB- pictured left -RRB- .<-->O
By all accounts , this stance has gone out of fashion .<-->N
Even the `` hands on knees '' position -LRB- pictured right -RRB- , rather less undignified , is perhaps less favored than it once was .<-->O
A slightly different version of this is shown in the posed picture at the top of this page .<-->N
Probably more often still , he may be required merely to put his hands on the desk , leaning forward only a few degrees from the vertical -LRB- pictured right -RRB- even though , and particularly with today 's fashion for loose clothing , this is clearly less effective in terms of pulling the fabric taut across the student 's seat .<-->O
This is not a particularly recent trend -- the command `` Put your hands on the desk '' is heard in the Butler , PA documentary from 1978 Where and by whom .<-->N
Until recent years , CP was often administered in the classroom , or in the hallway outside it .<-->N
It was also an American tradition for sports coaches to do a lot of on-the-spot paddling , typically in the locker-room or even out on the field .<-->N
While all those things still happen in a few places -- see this 2013 video clip from Louisiana -- it is much more common now for the punishment to be delivered privately in an office , often by the principal or deputy principal or at least in his or her presence .<-->O
It is less likely nowadays to be done on the spur of the moment , and more likely to require formal bureaucratic procedures and specific documentation .<-->O
This affords greater legal certainty , and guards against the danger of angry teachers resorting to random violence .<-->O
Who gets paddled .<-->N
In some areas in the past , it was made explicit that only boys could be chastised , as in Cincinnati -LRB- Ohio -RRB- in 1898 .<-->N
Nowadays , in most places , female as well as male students may receive CP , or , at least , modern American notions about sexual equality require that they be given the opportunity to receive it wherever boys may do so .<-->O
For a relatively early mention see this Oct 1952 news item about four teenage girls paddled in Pennsylvania .<-->N
An example of the trend gathering steam can be found in this 1988 news item from Ohio about high-school girls demanding the right to be paddled .<-->N
They thought it unfair that boys got a choice between spanking and detention , while girls had no option but to serve the detention .<-->N
Since then , this kind of sex-discrimination seems to have disappeared nearly everywhere , in public schools at least -LRB- some private schools do still make an explicit distinction between the sexes in this matter -RRB- .<-->O
An unusually late convert to the cause of sexual equality was Sulphur Springs High School in Texas , where it was not until recently that a student survey asked , `` Should girls be allowed to get swats ? ''<-->N
The replies were positive , and female students began choosing to receive corporal discipline at the start of 2014 , according to informed sources .<-->N
In practice , though , statistics consistently suggest that around 75 % to 85 % of paddlings are still of male students .<-->O
That is , roughly three boys are spanked for every girl .<-->N
This might be , in part , because boys -LRB- and probably their parents -RRB- are more likely than girls to opt for CP , if given the choice .<-->O
But we should bear in mind that , according to official figures , boys much more often receive any kind of punishment than girls .<-->O
Males and females are different : over 90 % of the prison population is male .<-->N
Boys just are on average worse-behaved than girls , though this does appear to be a little less true that it once was .<-->O
Age restrictions .<-->N
In general , statistics show that the most typical recipients of corporal punishment in the USA are boys aged 13 through 16 -- much as in pretty well all other cultures since the dawn of time .<-->O
But in the great majority of American school districts , there are no age limits : the recipient may be any age from 4 through 19 .<-->N
Twelfth-graders , who might have been driving automobiles for three or four years , or having legal sex for two years , can be and are spanked in some high schools .<-->O
In certain places , such as Alvarado ISD in Texas -LRB- which does not use CP at the elementary level at all -RRB- , it has been reported that most of the district 's paddlings take place in grades 9 through 12 .<-->O
Some anecdotal accounts suggest that these students , especially if male , can expect to be paddled a lot harder , stroke for stroke , than younger recipients .<-->N
We might note in passing here that the minimum school leaving age in Texas was increased to 18 in 1997 .<-->N
In most of the other paddling states , it is still 16 or 17 .<-->N
This kind of punishment seems particularly prevalent for 16 - , 17 - and 18-year-old high-school `` athletes '' -LRB- members of sports teams -RRB- in small-town Texas , where there is a tradition of sports coaches wielding the paddle on behalf of the school , even when the offense is not sports-related -LRB- such as for failing grades -RRB- , as reported in this May 2012 illustrated news item about a 17-year-old footballer paddled at Ozen High School in Beaumont ISD .<-->O
Indeed , some school districts in Texas -- where high-school sports are a really big deal , often dominating the headlines of the local newspaper -- produce an `` Athletic handbook '' , separate from the main student handbook .<-->O
This often states not only that sports coaches may administer CP to team members , but also that `` athletes '' are held to a stricter standard of behavior than other students .<-->N
They are thus more likely to be spanked if they break either the general school rules or the extra rules especially laid down for their team .<-->O
The legal position relating to students who have reached the age of majority -LRB- 18 in most states , though it is 21 in Mississippi -RRB- seems to be a bit of a gray area .<-->O
Does the school cease at that point to be in loco parentis ?<-->N
Common sense would suggest that it should then be for the student him - or herself to accept or refuse a paddling , without reference to the parents .<-->O
-LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- Cordell High School , Oklahoma , is one of very few schools whose handbook explicitly covers this point : `` Corporal punishment may only be given when authorized by the student 's parent/guardian or authorized by a student that is 18 years or older '' .<-->O
But that is not how the judges saw it in this 2005 Texas case .<-->N
Jessica Serafin was 18 years old when she was paddled for a summer school rule violation at the School of Excellence in Education , a public charter school in San Antonio .<-->N
Her hand `` suffered minor , temporary injuries '' when she improperly failed to keep her hands away from her bottom while being disciplined .<-->N
Ms. Serafin sued .<-->N
The three federal judges ruled unanimouslyEXTERNAL LINK : opens in new window in October 2007 that `` having voluntarily chosen to attend classes after her eighteenth birthday and remain enrolled , she was not free to disregard school rules '' .<-->O
They added that `` the Texas statute governing the use of corporal punishment in schools makes no differentiation between adults and minors , stating that all students are eligible to receive corporal punishment '' .<-->N
The US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal against this decision .<-->N
Accordingly , at least in Texas , by continuing in school after becoming legal adults , 18-year-olds make themselves `` eligible '' to be spanked , even if they would prefer ISS or another form of discipline .<-->O
Once he or she turns 18 , can the student sign a form opting him - or herself out of paddling ?<-->N
Texas law says `` parents '' can sign the opt-out , so the answer is probably not .<-->N
Conversely , what if a parent of a high-school student signs a form exempting the student from paddling but then the student turns 18 and would prefer swats to ISS ; do the young adult 's wishes override those of his or her parents ?<-->O
They surely ought to do in logic , but it is unclear .<-->O
But such questions arise only very rarely .<-->O
Informed sources report that the age of majority makes very little difference in practice : 18-year-old students are just as likely as 17-year-olds to prefer a spanking to some other penalty , and in that event their parents , if they get involved at all , hardly seem likely to protest .<-->O
Racial disparities .<-->N
Opponents sometimes claim that corporal punishment is racially discriminatory because statistics show that black students are more likely to be paddled than white ones , pro rata to the population as a whole .<-->O
In fact , though , the same applies to suspensions and other kinds of punishment , so while there may be a `` racial problem '' in school discipline overall , it is not specifically a `` corporal punishment problem '' .<-->O
A long Apr 2014 article in The Nation discusses this point , with particular reference to Mississippi , where about 50 % of all public school students are black , but black students account for 64 % of those officially spanked .<-->O
The article notes that many black people strongly support CP , and some view it as a valued part of their cultural heritage .<-->O
Rules and regulations .<-->N
Many US school districts nowadays lay down more or less detailed rules for the administration of CP and publish them in their school handbooks .<-->N
-LRB- For a very early example , see this May 1950 news item . -RRB-<-->N
These often specify such things as the offenses for which a paddling may be meted out , the permissible dimensions of the paddle , the part of the body to be targeted -LRB- usually `` the buttocks '' but sometimes `` the buttocks area '' , `` the lower posterior '' or `` the seat of the pants '' -RRB- , who can administer it and where and in whose presence , what `` due process '' is required -LRB- e.g. formally stating in the presence of the witness what the student is being punished for , and inviting the student to state his or her case -RRB- , whether prior parental consent is necessary , and what happens if the student refuses to submit to the punishment .<-->O
Handbooks frequently also stipulate the maximum number of swats/licks that may be delivered .<-->N
Nowadays it often three , sometimes only two , occasionally four -LRB- but five or six in some Louisiana and Mississippi districts -RRB- .<-->N
This is normally taken to mean `` swats per paddling incident '' , but a few school districts lay down a maximum per student per day .<-->O
An unusual variation on this is to prescribe a larger number of swats spread over consecutive days , such as the recently adopted scheme at Jim Ned High School in Tuscola , Texas , whereby students who reach step 5 of the `` discipline ladder '' receive no fewer than `` 9 swats -LRB- 3 per day for 3 days -RRB- or 3 days of ISS '' .<-->O
Similarly , in 2014 Eldorado High School in Schleicher County , Texas , increased its penalty for a sixth tardy per semester from six swats to no less than 10 , to be delivered at the rate of two swats per day for 5 days .<-->O
But such arrangements are probably exceptional .<-->N
The gender issue .<-->N
It has become increasingly common , though it is still not universal , for the rules to stipulate that the paddling must be delivered -- or , failing that , witnessed -- by a staff member of the same sex as the student .<-->O
This probably reflects unease in some quarters about the idea of men spanking teenage girls .<-->N
For example , in 2011 the Texas Association of School Boards -LRB- TASB -RRB- inserted a new provision in its model school policy : `` Corporal punishment shall be administered only by an employee who is the same sex as the student '' .<-->N
Many school districts adopted the revised policy without paying any attention to the new provision .<-->N
This ended up embarrassing Springtown ISD -LRB- Independent School District -RRB- when a male administrator at Springtown High School , following time-honored practice and unaware that the rules had changed The girls ' mothers complained , and a widely publicized brouhaha ensued .<-->O
This included a lively public meeting of the school board at which other young ladies who had been disciplined at the high school with the male vice-principal 's paddle stood up and defended the practice : `` I 've had swats from him before , and they hurt , but that 's why we have parental consent '' , declared Ms Bartee .<-->O
Springfield ISD then rescinded the policy change so that a male administrator could again paddle a female student , provided a female staff member was present as a witness .<-->N
When it became clear that the new TASB model text was merely a suggestion and not a legal requirement , quite a few other school districts followed suit , mainly because in a small district there might not be enough administrators of both sexes to make a same-sex requirement practical .<-->O
Thus , the Hemphill , Mineola and O'Donnell ISDs adopted the `` same sex '' language in 2011 but O'Donnell ISD removed it in January 2014 , Mineola ISD in March 2014 and Hemphill ISD in August 2014 .<-->N
To this extent , there has been a partial reversal in Texas of the general national trend towards having a same-sex requirement .<-->F
The range of offenses that can be punished with a paddling varies very widely from one place to another .<-->N
Some handbooks spell them out in great detail , while others leave the matter vague .<-->O
It can be difficult to see why certain violations merit a spanking and others do not , especially when different school districts sometimes adopt almost diametrically opposite policies .<-->O
Often , CP is deemed appropriate for intermediate `` crimes '' , those that are neither very trivial nor very serious ; but some schools say it is appropriate only for relatively minor lapses , while a few make clear that , to the contrary , it is regarded as a severe punishment for serious offenses only .<-->O
Either way , it is almost never `` a last resort '' , despite that tired phrase still being trotted out here and there .<-->O
In general , though , it is common to find CP specified for fighting , tardiness , dress code and grooming -LRB- 3 -RRB- violations , misbehavior on the school bus , defiance , smoking , public display of affection , parking/driving offenses , profanity , and bullying , among many others .<-->O
A few schools operate a system whereby specific offenses attract a stated number of demerits , and a paddling is automatic upon accumulating a certain quota of demerits in a semester .<-->O
-LRB- 3 -RRB- `` Grooming '' usually refers to things like hair length and style , and forbidden piercing or jewelry .<-->O
In the case of high-school boys , it can also include the offense of coming to school unshaven , a paddling matter in some districts .<-->N
See also this Aug 2005 news item about 28 students paddled at an Alabama high school for failing to get a haircut when so instructed .<-->O
In addition , CP is used by many schools to enforce student compliance with other forms of discipline .<-->N
Examples include paddling for missing detention , skipping Saturday school , or violating the detention or in-school suspension rules .<-->F
Again , see the school handbooks pages for details in various different districts .<-->N
In the modern era , in public schools at any rate , corporal punishment is regarded as inappropriate for poor work or academic inadequacy as opposed to behavioral or `` moral '' lapses .<-->O
One significant exception to this , found particularly in Texas , is where sports coaches are empowered to spank athletes for failing grades , when lack of effort at school work can mean losing their hard-won place on the team .<-->O
Time of day .<-->N
There appears to be a growing tendency for high schools to carry out all paddlings at the start of the first school day following the offense .<-->O
For example , Alabama 's Sylacauga High School reintroduced paddling a few years ago , and its handbook now provides : `` Corporal punishment will be administered at a pre-determined time and location before each school day '' .<-->N
At Mildred High and Junior High School in Texas , the student handbook for 2013/14 EXTERNAL LINK : opens in new window quoted from its form sent to parents , `` Your child has chosen to break the student code of conduct -LSB- ... -RSB- Your child has asked to receive Corporal Punishment -LRB- swats -RRB- in lieu of ISS -LRB- In school Suspension -RRB- .<-->N
With your permission I will administer corporal punishment in the morning at 8:00 a.m. '' .<-->N
In school systems -LRB- probably a minority -RRB- like Mildred ISD that require parents to approve each CP instance individually in advance , this entails the student taking the discipline slip home at night for parental signature .<-->N
The student presents the signed slip on arrival at school the following morning and then receives his or her swats .<-->N
Whether parental approval is required separately for each punishment or not , delaying the paddling overnight in this manner might be thought to give the student time to think about what is coming and resolve to change his or her behavior .<-->O
It may also have the advantage of ensuring that all CP is given in a detached and calm manner , and doing it before lessons begin means that the student wastes no further time in the office when he or she should be in class .<-->O
A matter of choice .<-->N
To a much greater extent than in the past , paddling has become in many schools an option for either the student or the parent , or both .<-->N
Very likely , CP would not survive in as many places as it does , were this not so .<-->O
Older teens , especially , may be offered a choice between a spanking and , say , detention or ISS .<-->N
Some school handbooks , particularly at high-school level , lay down precise equivalences -LRB- either in general or for specific offenses -RRB- , such as `` three paddle swats or four days ' after-school detention Much anecdotal evidence suggests that , in these circumstances , most teens , and certainly most young men , opt for the spanking , preferring to endure a `` short sharp shock '' of severe physical pain for a relatively brief duration , followed by a sore backside for a day or two , rather than long , tedious hours of unhealthy incarceration .<-->O
In effect , students in these places may be seen to have been given `` a right to be paddled '' as well as `` a right not to be paddled '' .<-->O
For a real-life example of this policy being put into practice at Booneville High School in Arkansas , where the choice is between three paddle swats or Saturday detention , see these video clips .<-->N
Some schools explicitly state that no student will receive corporal punishment against his or her own wish .<-->O
A few restrict the number of times per semester that a student may choose a spanking .<-->N
Many schools offer parents the opportunity to register in writing their desire that their son or daughter not be paddled , but often stress that , in that case , the only alternative is suspension .<-->O
As noted , some school districts , rather than allowing parents to `` opt out '' , now require them to explicitly `` opt in '' before the paddle can be used , but in most places the convention is still that a student may be spanked forthwith unless there is a parental opt-out notice already on file in the office .<-->O
Effects on the student .<-->N
The effects of paddling can vary a lot , depending on how forcefully it is applied and also , to a degree , on the student 's size , build and physical resilience .<-->N
Paddled students tend to say that it hurts like crazy at the time , but that the pain often does not last very long .<-->O
There may be yelps and tears and red faces , as attested by numerous anecdotal eyewitness and first-person accounts .<-->N
But even a paddling of four or five hard swats will , if administered accurately , only leave the buttocks sore and red or , at worst , harmlessly bruised for several days ; it does not cause injury or bleeding .<-->O
Private schools .<-->N
Private schools are less constrained than public ones in matters of punishment .<-->N
Often , part of their appeal to parents is that they can boast much better-behaved pupils than public schools because they are freer to impose strict discipline .<-->O
This can involve some private schools in frequent applications of CP -- especially , but not only , some Christian schools , who are able to invoke biblical justifications for it .<-->O
Some boarding schools , too , have been noted for making extensive use of the paddle , particularly `` historically black '' ones or those with a military emphasis .<-->O
Note too that there are many states -- including Alaska , California , Illinois , Michigan , Nevada , New York , Utah and Washington State -- where paddles are deployed in some private schools , even though they are banned in public ones .<-->O
There are only two states where CP in private schools is prohibited by law : Iowa and New Jersey .<-->N
Much research remains to be done on the history of corporal punishment in American education .<-->F
Presumably the early settlers brought their own existing practices with them from Europe .<-->N
Whipping with a switch is much mentioned in literature in , especially , the 19th century , often making use of branches or twigs collected right outside the schoolroom .<-->O
In some districts , such as Alameda in California in 1893 , regulations specified the use of a leather strap on the palm of the hand , as in Scotland and Canada , but this does not seem to have been widespread in the USA .<-->O
However , a strap is also mentioned -LRB- no target area specified -RRB- in this 1880 case in New York State .<-->N
It is far from clear why , how , or exactly when the wooden paddle -LRB- originally , it is often alleged , an implement associated with slavery -RRB- became almost universally adopted .<-->N
The paddle has also long been a feature of American college fraternity life -- but which came first ?<-->N
At all events , anecdotal evidence suggests that paddling had become the norm for school CP in most districts by the 1930s if not 1920s .<-->N
An early mention of the word `` paddle '' comes in this 1887 news item about an allegedly excessive school punishment in Iowa .<-->N
In that case , the implement is described as `` a hickory club or ` paddle ' , three feet long , one-half inch thick and one and one-half inches wide '' .<-->N
A newspaper editorial in 1908 opined that the paddle seemed `` almost divinely appointed '' for the purpose of punishing a boy , and explained why it was so suited to application to his rear end : `` That area of the body which it most aptly fits is not very susceptible to mortal wounds ... the bones which it contains are so abundantly swathed about with muscular tissue that there is no danger of breaking them '' .<-->O
Some commentators have surmised anecdotally that the paddle may have come to be favored over the switch because of its weight and solidity , so that , if used properly , it can be effective even through fairly thick clothing , such as denim jeans -LRB- invented in the 1870s -RRB- with their patch pockets over the seat .<-->O
In the past , some paddles had holes drilled in them , to reduce air resistance , as in this picture from a fictional film -LRB- right -RRB- .<-->O
This supposedly increases the effectiveness of the punishment , but is nowadays rare , and explicitly disallowed by some school district regulations , probably because of fears that it could increase the propensity for bruising .<-->O
There were one or two places where the rattan cane was the official instrument , notably the Boston public schools until the 1960s .<-->N
Even odder in American terms , the Boston rattan was applied to the student 's hand -LRB- see J. Kozol , `` Death at an Early Age '' , The Atlantic , September 1967EXTERNAL LINK : opens in new window -RRB- .<-->N
Massachusetts abolished school CP in 1972 .<-->N
The rattan was also used in St Louis , Missouri , until it was abolished in 1981 .<-->F
Also a special case is New Jersey , which abolished school CP in 1867 , more than a century before any other state .<-->N
-LRB- 4 -RRB- An attempt to reintroduce it in Newark NJ , with parental consent only , was rejected in 1894 .<-->N
The press coverage implies that the implement used was to have been the rattan , had the legislation passed .<-->N
-LRB- 4 -RRB- But at least one New Jersey school got round this by requiring parents to come and spank their unruly offspring -- see this Oct 1900 news item .<-->O
Another non-standard implement once used in a few areas was a length of rubber hose , as in this 1912 case in New Mexico and this 1919 case in Vermont and this 1924 case in New York and this 1960 case in Ohio .<-->N
Some big-city school districts , especially in the urban north , abolished CP long before the states in which they are situated .<-->O
Thus , New York City first banned it in public schools in 1870 , while in New York State as a whole it was not discontinued until 1985 .<-->N
College and university .<-->N
It is surprising to discover that college students and university freshmen could at one time be paddled in some places .<-->N
See these 1922 rules for the spanking of students by campus police at Northwestern University in Chicago , and these Sep 1919 news items about punishments at the University of Missouri carried out by senior students with official approval , in a tradition said to have been started in 1905 and upheld in a vote of the student body in 1920 .<-->O
At the University of Washington in Seattle , spanking was supposedly banned in 1914 .<-->N
One could regard some of this as analogous with canings by prefects in English schools .<-->N
It seems to have been something quite different from fraternity paddling , a private unofficial activity that has more to do with hazing than punishment .<-->N
Meanwhile at Texas A&M University , paddling with an ax handle has been described by one informed source as `` the traditional method of discipline at the university '' until as recently as the mid-1980s -- see this picture .<-->N

Trends in Discipline and the Decline in Use of Corporal Punishment -LSB- DOC -RSB- Information note -LRB- 2011 -RRB- from the Florida Department of Education gives some useful statistics .<-->F
Students receiving CP in Florida declined from 13,900 in 1994-95 to 3,661 in 2009-10 .<-->F
The number of districts using the paddle has fallen to 30 -LRB- out of 67 -RRB- .<-->F
Figures for individual districts are given for 2009-10 .<-->F
The winner is Jackson , with 480 spankings recorded .<-->N
Analysis of the figures reveals that all the paddling districts are in the Florida panhandle and the inland part of the peninsula : corporal punishment has disappeared entirely from the east and west peninsular coasts .<-->N
The document notes that , as paddlings went down in the 1990s , suspensions rose sharply by a much larger amount , though they have fallen back somewhat in the latest five years .<-->O
In other words , the increased suspensions were not merely replacements for CP .<-->N
One might infer from this a general collapse in discipline due at least in part , perhaps , to the loss of the deterrent effect of the paddle in those districts that have abandoned it .<-->O
Center for Effective Discipline This anti-CP organization sets out , for each state in which CP is banned , the legislation or ruling under which abolition took place and the year .<-->N
It also gives the paddling statistics for each state where CP is still used -LRB- figures for the 2005-06 school year -RRB- .<-->N
And , if you scroll down a bit further , it explains the rather convoluted procedure for accessing , from the relevant federal government website , the latest estimated paddling statistics for individual school districts .<-->O
As noted in the article at the top of this page , these figures may not be altogether reliable .<-->O
Correlation between high rates of corporal punishment in public schools and social pathologies This so-called `` research study '' takes CP figures from the top ten paddling states and attempts to match them to data about such diverse matters as the murder rate , reading proficiency levels , and unmarried mothers .<-->O
The paper then grudgingly concedes that a statistical correlation does not prove a causal relationship , and lamely attempts to meet this point by quoting various other documents .<-->O
Some of these are purely anecdotal and others are `` studies '' , such as those by Dr Murray Straus , which had nothing to do with school paddling but looked at the spanking of toddlers by their mothers , an entirely different subject .<-->N
Quite aside from any other considerations , several of the `` top ten '' paddling states in fact have very low percentages of students paddled .<-->O
In Texas , for example , the figure looks large in absolute terms , but represents less than 2 % of students .<-->O
How likely is it that something directly affecting at most 2 % of a given population is going to have , of itself , a measurable effect on the wider society in the whole of that area ?<-->N
The paper concludes with the bald assertion that `` corporal punishment in public schools clearly has disastrous effects on children and communities '' , having in fact wholly failed to demonstrate any such thing .<-->O
For my own explanation as to why statistical juggling exercises of this sort are invariably a waste of time , see this article on my Questions and Answers page .<-->N

A Shock to the Conscience : The Due Process Clause and Corporal Punishment Article -LRB- 2001 -RRB- in American School Board Journal about whether the constitution places any limits on the severity of school CP .<-->N
Legitimated Violence in Schools : The Power Behind the Paddle This `` academic '' essay , written in tendentious sociological jargon and published in the `` Advancing Women in Leadership Journal '' , attacks CP from a hardline feminist and `` children 's rights '' ideological perspective .<-->N
There is a lot about `` hegemonic masculinity '' , wherein even Desmond Morris 's ancient pseudo-anthropological fantasies about the `` bent-over submissive posture '' and CP as a `` form of ritual copulation '' are trotted out once more .<-->O
Few readers of either sex will , I suspect , be inclined to take any of this stuff seriously , but the document does include a plausible vignette of a day at a southern elementary school , including eyewitness accounts of paddlings of a girl and a boy .<-->O
The paper is mistaken , incidentally , in stating that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child `` calls for a worldwide ban on corporal punishment '' .<-->N
The Convention does nothing of the sort .<-->N
The words `` corporal punishment '' do not appear anywhere in it , and nor does it contain any references to paddling , spanking , or any similar wording .<-->N
What it does call for is the protection of children from `` mental and physical violence '' .<-->N
When countries signed up to the Convention -LRB- which , in any case , the USA has not done -RRB- , they can not reasonably have supposed that it prohibited ordinary , moderate spanking or paddling which causes no injury .<-->O
Another error is the assertion that `` every industrialized nation in the world , except the U.S. , has abolished corporal punishment in schools '' .<-->N
Singapore is certainly an industrialized country , to name but one where school CP is entirely legal and in widespread use .<-->O
The main difference between legal and illegal gambling is that legal gambling is monitored by government inspections agencies .<-->N
But more people gamble because it is legal , and although the government collects taxes on jackpots , Indian casinos and lotteries , the system is highly subject to fraud .<-->O
Gambling online is illegal -LRB- federally -RRB- , but this doesn t stop people from doing it .<-->N
And even though the Organized Crime Section of the Department of Justice found that the rate of illegal gambling in those states which have some legalized form of gambling was three times as high as those states where there was not a legalized form of gambling , we still believe that gambling is a drain to society .<-->O
Here are our Top 5 reasons why .<-->N
Reasons Why Gambling Should Be Illegal 1 .<-->F
Gambling is subject to fraud .<-->N
Legalized gambling , specifically Indian gaming , is the fastest growing industry in the world , and can have a corrupting influence on state government .<-->O
The governments are addicted to the revenue received from Indian gaming and lotteries .<-->N
Recently there have been numerous news reports of corruption and fraud in state lotteries .<-->N
Availability of gambling facilities increases risk of problem gambling .<-->N
Legalized gambling makes this activity available to too many people .<-->N
Governments and casinos portray this as a harmless form of entertainment .<-->N
Because of the availability of legalized gambling , it is more addictive and destructive than most other addictions .<-->N
Furthermore , most citizens would not gamble illegally .<-->O
Legalized gambling , therefore , entices people to gamble , who normally would not gamble at all .<-->O
In states with different numbers of games , participation rates increase steadily and sharply as the number of legal types of gambling increases .<-->N
In fact , legalized gambling in various states has not been a competitor to , but rather has become a stimulator of illegal gambling .<-->O
The public is assured they have the potential to win a huge jackpot .<-->N
All that is required is to drive to the casino or purchase a lottery ticket .<-->N
Because of the availability of gambling , many gamblers become addicted and compulsive .<-->N

Problem gambling costs society billions annually .<-->N
The social costs of gambling addictions will eventually impact careers , physical and mental health issues , bankruptcy , divorce , crimes , and treatment .<-->N
The gamblers will eventually rely on welfare or unemployment benefits , impacting the government , and the costs could reach several billions of dollars per year .<-->O
Gambling exploits the poor .<-->N
Evidence shows that legalized gambling often hurts and even destroys , especially those who are poor and disadvantaged .<-->O
If gambling were illegal , the gambling venues would not be able to promote their lotteries , casinos , or other forms of betting and exploit people who are most vulnerable .<-->O
Gambling sets a double standard for governments .<-->F
State lotteries are argueably an effective way to raise taxes .<-->N
Legalized gambling is a disturbing governmental policy .<-->N
Governments should promote desirable qualities in the citizens and not seduce them to gamble in state-sponsored vice .<-->O
When this occurs , the government contributes to the corruption of society .<-->N
Legalized gambling is a bad social policy .<-->N
At a time when independent organizations estimate that there are at least 12 million compulsive gamblers , it does not make a lot of sense to have the state promoting gambling .<-->O
State sponsorship of gambling makes it harder , for the compulsive gambler to reform .<-->N
Compulsive Gambling Costs In addition to the above reasons for making gambling illegals , are the economic costs that gamblers themselves incur .<-->N
The average compulsive gambler has debts exceeding $ 80,000 .<-->O
Additionally , compulsive gamblers affect the lives of family , friends , and business associates .<-->O
Some of the consequences of gambling include marital disharmony , divorce , child abuse , substance abuse , and suicide attempts .<-->O
Other social costs surface because of family neglect , embezzlement , theft , and involvement in organized crime .<-->N
Crossing our fingers or wishing on a star will not guarantee a win .<-->O
The only guarantee is , if a person is a compulsive gambler and continues to gamble , the end result is prison , insanity , or death .<-->O
Whether gambling is legal or illegal , there will always be gamblers .<-->N
Wan na bet ?<-->N
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- > Gambling is bad for society and should definitely be made unlawful : Gambling is an addictive habit .<-->O
In many cases it ruins lives because gamblers usually care about nothing but gambling .<-->N
If it is made unlawful , people might give up the habit or desist from taking it up at all .<-->O
Gambling is a choice : I have gone to Casino 's for years .<-->N
I take in what I am willing to lose , because the atmosphere is great and there is a slim possibility I may walk out with more than I walked in with .<-->O
Me and my wife love to go to a casino about two times a year , and just get away .<-->O
We spend our `` extra '' money we have saved up just for that occasion .<-->N
We should have a choice to spend OUR money any way we choose , and yes some people do have addictions to gambling , but I am willing to bet that drugs and alcohol addiction are a MUCH worse problem than a Casino where most people go for a good time .<-->O
I have a dozen friends that feel the same way and some friends that do n't like Casino 's at all ... .<-->O
That 's their American right .<-->N
No one has a right to infringe upon that right .<-->O
All my friends agree that even though they might not want to go , I and anyone else in America DOES RESERVE THE RIGHT FOR CHOICE !<-->O
Its no different than telling me I have to stay away from Disney or Six Flags because they rip you off at the ticket gate just to ride on a potentially life threatening roller coaster or bumper cars , and pay outrageous prices for a souvenir inside the park .<-->O
Its my choice to pay those outrageous prices with my hard earned money and to `` gamble '' on my safety ... Not yours .<-->O
Gambling needs to be outlawed : Look , I work in a casino and before I took the job , I was saying all the same things as those on here who think gambling should not be illegal .<-->O
I had the same opinions to justify my employment .<-->O
But after 4 years of this soul-crushing job that our poor economy has me trapped in due to a lack of other available jobs , I have come to realize just how negative gambling is and have since changed my stance on this issue .<-->O
Let me tell you , nothing good comes from gambling .<-->N
Only the dumbest people will gamble and on average , most casino gamblers are arrogant , entitled , greedy , stupid , lazy and selfish .<-->O
The try to lie to us , they try to cheat the casino and other players and they are just simply very irresponsible .<-->O
Gambling is not a hobby and no , people do not do it for fun , like they try to claim .<-->O
To these people , gambling is serious business , not entertainment , because they would rather win their money than work for it and to those ends , they are not even smart enough to invest in low risk stocks and bonds .<-->O
They would rather put money they do n't have , that they most likely got from a credit card cash advance , into a slot machine called `` Hee Haw , '' featuring a picture of a retarded , buck-tooth donkey on the front , than to invest it in something smart like a Roth IRA .<-->O
And these people actually feel that this is a sound investment , yet they find themselves surprised when they lose , not if but when , and then they get mad about it and start blaming everybody else around them , because after all , blaming other people is easier than taking responsibility for their own actions .<-->O
And the worst part is , these people do not learn from their mistakes !<-->O
They just keep doing it and doing and doing it and retain nothing from previous experiences !<-->N
I see it everyday , people sign up for a comp card and when I ask for photo ID , they open their wallet and there it is , the Foodstamp card or the Welfare card .<-->N
And then the next thing they ask me is where they can get a cash advance on a credit card .<-->N
Look , this is bad for society and for the economy , no matter how you slice it .<-->N
Most gamblers can not afford to be gambling in the first place and then it costs everybody tax dollars .<-->N
I do n't know if they are on Welfare because of gambling or if they gamble because Welfare pays all their expenses and thus frees up money , but either way , one is the cause of the other and neither is good .<-->O
Look , gambling is a problem , not `` fun , '' not `` entertainment , '' and not a `` hobby . ''<-->N
There is no such thing as `` responsible gaming . ''<-->N
Gambling by its very nature is irresponsible .<-->O
And if you are religious , its also a sin , because you are trying to take something that is not yours to take .<-->N
Now granted I know the casinos are wrong too , not just the players , but the casinos would not exist if people did n't go to them .<-->O
And nobody puts a gun to your head and makes you go to the casino .<-->N
Both sides of the common argument are wrong , but more so the gamblers because they provide the demand for which the casino exists to exploit .<-->O
Yes , the argument can be made that casinos benefit the economy , but for every tax dollar made , just think of how many tax dollars it costs to hire additional law enforcement , to fund more Welfare and Foodstamps , and to fund gambling treatment programs .<-->O
The costs of legalized gambling far outweigh the benefits of it .<-->N
Gambling is addictive and leads to compulsive gambling problems and unhealthy obsessions , it promotes crime , sin , stupidity , laziness , arrogance , greed , selfishness , entitlement , and neglect of ones family among other horrible things , and in general , can be most accurately described as an economic and moral cancer in our society .<-->O
Trust me , I work in a casino and deal with this crap everyday .<-->N
And I am trying so hard to find another job and I have been for over 3 and a half years now .<-->O
I know that benefiting from gambling is wrong too and it kills me inside to know where my paychecks come from , but I am doing the very best that I can to get out now .<-->O
I am not perfect , I have my flaws too , I am not trying to pass judgment while I myself do something just as bad - I 'm not that hypocritical .<-->O
But you can trust what I tell about gambling because I see it constantly .<-->N
I know I would be out of a job , but the greater needs of society outweigh my own , and to those ends , I strongly feel that gambling is bad for society and should be made unlawful .<-->O
Casinos should be shut down and gambling made illegal again .<-->O
Gambling is not bad for society and it should not be made unlawful : People use critical thinking and strategies when gambling in casinos .<-->O
When you are gambling it is healthy to your brain because your using critical thinking skills and strategies .<-->O
Gambling is a different form of therapy .<-->N
The gambler finds relaxation in gambling which causes some good effects to health .<-->F
Our economy gets larger from the different job opportunities .<-->F
The government get lots of revenue from different casinos .<-->N
The resulting increase in the tax revenue will also lower the tax burden on other sources .<-->O
A new casino resort can create up to 10,000 new direct jobs .<-->N
There is a larger diversity where there are casinos and gambling .<-->N
People gain self-confidence from gambling inside of casinos .<-->N
Some gamblers do not care about the money , they just want to have fun .<-->O
From casino wins , even a poor person can become rich after gambling .<-->O
Pros Gambling and casinos are major tourist attraction .<-->N
-LRB- e.G. Las Vegas -RRB- Many structures get built from casino money .<-->N
Sometimes casinos give there money to different charities and funding .<-->F
Tourism can attract one million visitors annually .<-->F
Gambling can not physically hurt someone s health .<-->N
The majority of people who gamble do not experience problems .<-->N
Gambling is seen like a low-risk social activity for participants of all ages .<-->N
People can control gambling unlike drugs , cigarettes , and alcohol .<-->N
Gambling should not be made illegal : People should have the right to choose whether they want to take the risk of gambling .<-->O
Even if gambling were made illegal people would find a way around this law , this would mean that the government would not get any of the money .<-->O
The Government uses the money for education and healthcare -LRB- such as the national lottery fund -RRB- .<-->N
If gambling were banned it would only be the people running the illegal gambling who would make a profit .<-->O
Gambling is perhaps one of the things that has destroyed the black community : I can imagine that people who built casinos in black neighborhoods of big cities did it with the racist intention of keeping blacks subdued and out of white neighborhoods .<-->O
Now , normally I 'm not in favor of banning alcohol .<-->N
It is a beverage and it 's not something that can destroy a whole community .<-->N
It can destroy some people 's lives , however not an entire community .<-->O
Gambling is something very different .<-->N
It can destroy an entire community .<-->N
Casinos ruin local economy : The people who make money are the casino operators , state tax system , bankrupcy lawyers , pawn shops and payday loan sharks .<-->N
The real losers are every bussiness in the communities .<-->N
The money raised through gambling is way less than the impact on local bussiness .<-->N
Slot machines are popping up all over the country , inside convience stores , bars resturants etc. .<-->N
We need to stop this trend now .<-->N
No , we should n't make everything dangerous illegal. : Most people make a living from gambling .<-->O
Just think of the stock market .<-->N
It 's a form of gambling , no ?<-->N
You lose some , you win some , it is all about the MONEY !<-->N
People might argue that the casino is a highly dangerous place , but is n't it dangerous like any other place ?<-->O
Anywhere in this world has its dangers .<-->N
Whether it is at 7-Eleven or the playground , everywhere has its dangers .<-->N
Gambling is a destructive pleasure that sucks out the money of people that can not afford to lose it : Even though people always gamble , whether it is legal or not , gambling should be strongly discouraged whenever possible .<-->O
The people that gamble are usually the ones that do not have the extra money to lose .<-->N
People can get addicted to gambling and the problem can ruin their lives .<-->N
There is more disadvantages than advantages to have legalized gambling in an area .<-->N
I believe gambling does good for society , because it helps local governments raise revenue : Legal gambling has its place in society .<-->N
Forms of legal gambling , such as casinos and lotteries , help local governments raise revenue that can be used in the community .<-->N
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> Did you know that 40 % of all problem gamblers started gambling before they were seventeen ?<-->N
Or that problem gambling causes the most suicides out of all the recognized addictions ?<-->N
Even with these facts , the most startling truth is that not one federal dollar , out of the billions collected in gambling taxes , has been spent to treat or help problem gamblers .<-->O
Gambling is the activity or practice of playing at a game of chance for money or other stakes .<-->N
Activities that are considered gambling are sports and race bets , lotteries , games like blackjack and poker , and casino games like slots and roulette .<-->O
Bingo and raffles are technically gambling , but there are no major concerns about them , so they are not included here .<-->O
Gambling has been legalized by many states , but just because it is does not make it right .<-->O
Even though gambling is legal , it should not be because of its harmful economic , governmental , and social effects .<-->O
There are many detrimental economic effects of gambling , but there are two major ones : it siphons money from other industries , and states attempt to use lotteries to boost income .<-->O
Gambling takes money from consumers that would otherwise be spent in an important industry or charity .<-->O
Instead , it is essentially thrown away in hopes of getting rich quick .<-->O
The removal of money from other industries often causes businesses to go bankrupt , therefore creating more unemployed people .<-->N
You could argue that casinos create jobs , but those jobs do not make enough money to really support a family .<-->O
The other economic problem that gambling creates is the use of lotteries .<-->N
States typically use lotteries to make more money , but it is nowhere near as effective as other methods that are in use .<-->N
The state makes 40 % of the money that is put into lotteries , while they make 99 % of the money that goes into taxes .<-->N
Also , sources say that since the poor buy so many more lottery tickets than everyone else , the lotteries have become a tax on the poor and economically disadvantaged .<-->O
The economic effects may be bad , but the governmental and social effects are far more hurtful .<-->N
There are a few different damaging effects that gambling has on the government , but they fall into two categories : the government s role and illegal activity .<-->O
The government s role in gambling is not what it should be .<-->N
Drugs and gambling are both known to be self-destructive , yet drugs are banned and gambling is legalized ?<-->N
To the people that are compulsive gamblers , gambling is a drug to them , so it should be illegal like all other drugs .<-->O
The other poor role the government has in gambling is that the government gets a cut of the profits from it in the form of taxes .<-->N
As it was mentioned earlier , the poor and lower-middle class gamble more , so it is essentially a tax on the poor .<-->O
Illegal activity is another damaging governmental effect of gambling .<-->N
Since betting on sports and races are legal , it has become far easier for organized crime to make money off of fixed sporting events and racing .<-->N
From a sports standpoint , it makes point-shaving scandals a potentially larger issue , and can take away from the integrity of the game .<-->O
Additionally , in areas where gambling is legalized , illegal gambling increases .<-->N
Since people think it is okay to gamble , they now go to an illegal gambling location so that their winnings , if any , are not taxed by the government .<-->O
The destructive governmental and economical effects of gambling are horrible , but the social effects are the worst of all .<-->O
The harmful social effects of gambling are it forces the poor to stay poor , compulsive gamblers bring massive problems , and gambling can ruin lives and families .<-->O
Gambling at casinos and in lotteries have terrible odds of winning , but the poor , who desperately need the money , try time and time again in hopes of getting lucky to pull out of their economic problems .<-->O
However , they rarely win , and the amount of money that they pour in forces them stay poor .<-->N
Even if you are not poor and you start to gamble constantly , you will become poor very quickly .<-->O
Another harmful social effect of gambling is the presence of compulsive gamblers .<-->O
Compulsive , or problem , gamblers are people who are addicted to gambling .<-->N
Gambling is a drug to them , and they can not stop gambling , no matter the consequences .<-->N
A study showed that most compulsive gamblers started during their teen years , and that they are in close to $ 80,000 in debt .<-->O
Because of the staggering amount of debt they are in , they are a huge burden to their families .<-->O
The last harmful social effect of gambling is it destroys families .<-->N
The amount of debt that a compulsive gambler gets into puts way too much strain on the rest of the family to help him or her out of debt .<-->O
If you are married to a compulsive gambler , it is like being married to a hard-core drug addict , they are forced to throw away money to satisfy their addiction .<-->O
Unfortunately , sometimes the debt is too much , and the spouse will divorce , shattering the family .<-->O
The social effects of gambling are the worst , but all the effects of gambling are awful .<-->O
Unfortunately for us , gambling is legal in almost every state , allowing these hurtful effects to exist .<-->N
Even though gambling is legal , it should not be because of its harmful economic , governmental , and social effects .<-->O
If you are considering gambling sometime , think about what you are supporting , and how it could ruin your life .<-->O
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> GAMBLING SHOULD BE BANNED I agree with the statement that it is convenient to ban gambling .<-->O
There are few reasons why I support this statement .<-->N
First of all , the society will practice an unhealthy activity that will affect and harm their families .<-->O
Research stated that gamblers tend to be more violent to their spouses and would usually abuse their children .<-->O
Furthermore , these unfortunate children that have parents who are involved with gambling in general are more likely to have problems in school and have higher rate of suicide .<-->O
This is due to the over-loaded stresses that are given to them .<-->N
Moreover , gambling activities can destroy a person financial as the activities consume a lot of money and they can lose a large amount of money in a very short time .<-->O
In other word , it is very risky as everything depends wholly on luck .<-->O
It is even worst when the person is addicted because even though they have no money left they would find a way to get the money .<-->O
Some of them might even commit a crime by stealing money to fuel their gambling habits .<-->O
Thus , they will become violence to make sure that they can gamble no matter what are the consequences .<-->O
Gambling can also cause someone to lose interest to get involve with any other activities such as skipping work to gamble .<-->O
Thus they will have problems in having a good job or career .<-->O
They will also start to ignore their families and friends and isolate themselves from the society .<-->O
Finally , gambling activities will effect the gambler s health as they will get excited and stay up all night to gamble without any concern of their health .<-->O
The gamblers might not notice the symptoms such as sleeping problems , anxiety , stress , depression and unexplained anger .<-->O
These symptoms will occur when they are frustrated especially with the result of the gambling .<-->O
So it will affect the people around them emotionally and physically .<-->N
In conclusion , they are no doubt that gambling should be banned because this activity has a lot of negative effects not only to the person who is the gambler but all the people around them .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> Affirmative 1 : Problem gambling is a disease , not a choice .<-->N
For problem gamblers , gambling is a psychological addiction .<-->N
Studies have shown that the monetary rewards from gambling produce brain activity similar to that observed in cocaine addicts receiving an infusion of cocaine .<-->N
As a result , when problem gamblers do not win , they often become trapped in a cycle of chasing losses -LRB- i.e. , trying to recover the money that has already been lost -RRB- .<-->O
This results in them taking greater risks , with higher stakes , and sinking quickly and deeply into debt .<-->N
Once a gambler reaches this stage it is often too late .<-->N
The government often prohibits harmful products and prevents people from engaging in harmful behaviour .<-->O
The government should ban gambling .<-->N
Negative 1 : Drugs are physically and metabolically addictive in ways that gambling is not .<-->N
The vast majority of gamblers are not addicts but rather they gamble in a sensible and recreational manner .<-->O
Many gamblers enjoy the thrill of betting on a sporting event or participating in a card game .<-->O
The amount that they spend , and the enjoyment that they receive , is not dissimilar from going to the cinema , attending a concert , or eating out for dinner .<-->N
For many , gambling is a recreational pursuit , and a person s freedom to choose to gamble should not be restricted to prevent a small minority of people from making harmful choices .<-->O
Affirmative 2 : Gambling should not be thought of in the abstract .<-->N
In reality , poorer people are far more likely to gamble than anyone else .<-->O
The United States National Gambling Impact Commission has calculated that over 80 % of gamblers come from low income households .<-->N
Anecdotal evidence suggests the same is true in New Zealand .<-->N
Gambling exploits the most vulnerable member s of society -LRB- as these are the people most desperate for a windfall -RRB- .<-->O
This can have devastating effects on their families as these individuals do not have the discretionary income to sustain their gambling .<-->N
The impact on families is further exacerbated by increased likelihood that problem gamblers will become alcohol dependant .<-->O
Negative 2 : Casinos have methods to identify and help problem gamblers .<-->N
Casinos also allow gamblers to self-exclude themselves .<-->N
Because of the poor publicity that can result from problem gambling , modern casinos have an interest in minimising the problem .<-->O
There are also many easily accessible community groups who seek to help problem gamblers and their families .<-->O
As with alcohol , gambling can be harmful if it is abused .<-->N
But individuals must take some self responsibility and should be trusted to make their own decisions -LRB- and to seek help if necessary -RRB- .<-->O
Affirmative 3 : Casinos are commonly linked to other forms of crime -LRB- most often organised crime -RRB- .<-->O
For example , the Skycity casino in Auckland has been the subject of accusations , that it is frequently used for money laundering .<-->N
Overseas studies suggest that theft , violent crimes , and liquor violations also increase in the proximity of casinos .<-->N
Other socially frowned upon , although legal , behaviour also increases -LRB- for example , loan sharks and prostitutes are usually found in greater numbers near casinos -RRB- .<-->N
Negative 3 : Even if gambling was banned people would find a away around the ban .<-->N
In the past this might have meant back-room card games or word of mouth sports bookies .<-->N
However , now there are also hundreds of easily accessible internet casinos , hosted in other countries , that it would be very difficult to prevent people from accessing .<-->O
It is better to legalise and regulate gambling than to drive it underground .<-->O
Regulated casinos are more likely to have systems in place to identify problem gamblers and are more likely to contribute funds to the community to help deal with problem gambling .<-->O

Many more get enjoyment from gambling without problems why should these people suffer because a few others get addicted ?<-->O
The risks of gambling addiction are well known .<-->N
People can make a conscious choice to start gambling , and are aware of the risks of addiction .<-->N
Treatment programmes can address the problems of those who are addicted .<-->N
Gambling promotes unhealthy values .<-->N
It makes people concentrate of winning money .<-->N
This implies tha ... Gambling promotes unhealthy values .<-->N
It makes people concentrate of winning money .<-->N
This implies that they should value material goods above other things like friendships and families .<-->O
It also sends out the message that success should not necessarily be the result of merit and effort .<-->O
Instead , governments should promote values like thrift , hard work and self-reliance .<-->O
There is no evidence that gambling makes people not care about others .<-->N
People do not gamble because they expect to win lots of money .<-->N
Most gamble as a form of entertainment .<-->N
There are many areas of life where success is not the result of merit or hard work .<-->O
Someone born to well-off parents may get many advantages in life without merit or hard work .<-->O
There are therefore no grounds for thinking that gambling promotes undesirable values .<-->O
Casinos are often associated with criminal activity .<-->N
Drug dealers and prostitutes operate near casinos they know that there are a large number of potential clients in the area .<-->O
Casinos can therefore be devastating to neighbourhoods .<-->O
People committing crimes should be prosecuted .<-->N
The existence of criminals does not make nearby businesses -LRB- including casinos -RRB- immoral .<-->N
It is perverse to punish people who just want to gamble -LRB- and not take drugs or use prostitutes -RRB- by taking away their chance to do so .<-->O
The economic benefits of casinos are exaggerated .<-->N
They generally only create low-paid jobs for local people the casino companies usually bring in managers from elsewhere .<-->N
There is still considerable unemployment and poverty in places like Atlantic City .<-->O
The problems associated with casinos -LRB- e.g. crime , gambling addiction -RRB- outweigh the economic benefits .<-->O
In any case , an immoral industry is not justified by the fact that it creates employment .<-->O
Jobs could be created through many other industries that cause fewer moral and practical problems -LRB- e.g. theme parks -RRB- .<-->O
Far from harming neighbourhoods , casinos can revive areas .<-->N
They create jobs and cause money to be spent on transport infrastructure .<-->N
The jobs are not just in the casino itself .<-->N
More jobs are created in hotels and other parts of the tourism industry .<-->N
Casinos have helped to regenerate many places that previously had considerable poverty and social problems -LRB- e.g. Atlantic City in New Jersey -RRB- .<-->O
It is immoral for the state or charities to raise money by exploiting people s stupidity and greed .<-->O
Taxing gambling is a regressive tax -LRB- this means that the poor pay a greater proportion of their income in tax than the rich -RRB- .<-->O
This is because poor people are more likely to gamble .<-->O
Regressive taxation is deeply unfair .<-->O
Gambling is often used to raise money for the state or good causes .<-->N
Many governments tax gambling .<-->N
Some even run their own lotteries .<-->N
Charities use prize draws to raise funds .<-->N
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> I agree with the statement that gambling should be banned .<-->N
There are three reasons for this opinion .<-->N
There would be more criminal activity if society allowed gambling , gambling negatively affects family relations , and gambling could lead to health problems .<-->O
Gambling is often the cause of criminal activities .<-->N
Mafia members could use the money for illegal or dangerous purposes .<-->O
So , I recommend that we do not have gambling facilities .<-->N
Also , gamblers could start fighting each other or cause problems about money .<-->N
Gambling could affect family relations , because gamblers focus on gambling too much and they do not take care of their families .<-->O
Thus , gambling could be the cause of divorce or domestic violence .<-->N
For example , if a father gambles too much and does not come home until late at night , it could harm his relationship with his family .<-->O
Finally , gambling could have negative effect on health , because gambling too much could make people too excited and they would be unable to maintain good health .<-->O
For instance , gamblers might stay up late at night to gamble for long hours so they could easily catch a cold or become ill .<-->O
In conclusion , gambling should be banned because there would be more criminal activities if people allowed it , it would negatively affect family relations , and it could damage people s health .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> Internet gambling is booming as Americans continue to wager billions of dollars on online sports books , Web casinos and virtual poker rooms even though the U.S. Department of Justice considers such activities illegal .<-->O
Several U.S. lawmakers are trying to crack down on the industry by clarifying existing U.S. laws and making it easier to go after offenders .<-->O
One of those measures , the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act , seeks to curb online gambling by trying to cut off the money supply : the bill would outlaw the use of credit cards , checks or money transfers to settle wagers .<-->O
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Jim Leach -LRB- R-Iowa -RRB- .<-->N
The Wall Street Journal Online asked Rep. Leach and David Carruthers , chief executive of BetOnSports Plc , an online sports book and casino based in Costa Rica , to debate whether Internet gambling should be banned in the U.S. .<-->N
Their exchange , carried out over email , is below .<-->N
Rep. Leach writes : Casino gambling , as it is practiced in all Western democracies , has been allowed to exist only with comprehensive regulation .<-->N
Internet gambling lacks such oversight .<-->N
Offshore Internet gambling sites , which target the U.S. market and accept bets from Americans , operate in direct violation of U.S. law .<-->O
This is not theoretical or subject to interpretation .<-->N
When a site solicits and accepts wagers on sporting events and games of chance , these online casinos violate the Wire Act and the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act .<-->N
Gambling is one field where the efficiencies of the Internet are counterproductive for society .<-->N
When consumers deal with an offshore entity , they give their personal financial information to unknown individuals , who , by definition , are engaged in criminal activity .<-->N
Internet casinos introduce a gaming room in homes , offices and school dormitories with bettors who abdicate the comprehensive protections afforded by U.S. law .<-->N
Offshore Internet gambling sites sweep dollars out of the U.S. into largely unknown , often criminal hands .<-->N
The potential threat of identity theft and fraud is high for the individual bettor just as the risk posed to our national security from terror and criminal organizations that control such sites or used them for money laundering purposes is real .<-->O
Internet gambling 's characteristics are unique : Online players can gamble 24 hours a day from home ; children may play without sufficient age verification ; and betting with a credit card can undercut a player 's perception of the value of cash , leading to gambling addiction , bankruptcy and crime .<-->O
The illegal Internet gambling business is booming and the consequences of this unfettered illegal activity are profound .<-->O
Americans will send nearly $ 6 billion to unregulated , offshore online casinos this year , nearly half of the $ 12 billion bet world-wide on Internet gambling .<-->N
These sites evade rigorous U.S.-based regulations that control gaming by minors , problem gamblers , and ensure the integrity of the games .<-->O
But Internet gambling is more than a theoretical issue of technology confronting law .<-->N
Society is the family writ large , and it is the American family that is jeopardized by the lure of Internet gambling .<-->N
Problem gambling can lead to serious psychological and physical as well as financial harm .<-->O
Individuals who become `` hooked '' frequently lose their jobs , homes and marriage and sometimes even contemplate suicide .<-->O
Internet gambling is not alone in causing such consequences , but it facilitates and accentuates the challenges posed by problem gambling .<-->N
The problem with the current circumstance is that enforcement tools are so inadequate .<-->O
What the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act -LRB- H.R. 4411 -RRB- basically does is make it illegal to use a bank instrument such as a credit card or money transfer or check to settle an internet wager .<-->O
No approach to squelching Internet gaming will ever prove perfectly effective , but one that constrains the payment system has the highest chance of achieving credible results .<-->O
H.R. 4411 focuses on the gambling business , not the gambler .<-->N
It puts the principal enforcement burden on financial intermediaries such as banks .<-->N
The law stays generally static on what is illegal ; but enforcement is upgraded by making it more difficult for an Internet casino to operate .<-->O
Mr. Carruthers responds : It may surprise Rep. Leach to know that I share his concerns about problem gambling and underage gambling .<-->O
That is why I would like our business to be regulated by the U.S. government .<-->N
I run a multi-billion-dollar public company listed on the London Stock Exchange , and we operate with the highest standards of practice to protect consumers , restrict minor access and protect the vulnerable .<-->O
My company has controls in place that restrict access by minors and would cut off gambling from customers who exhibit excessive compulsive behavior .<-->O
Online gambling is the most transparent form of gambling there is -- every transaction is logged and every transaction is available for scrutiny .<-->O
I , and my peers at other major online operators , want regulation of our industry .<-->N
Regulation would standardize and strengthen our best practices and in addition provide taxable revenues to the U.S. government .<-->N
It is inconsistent to have comprehensive regulation of land-based casino gambling and to not have the same oversight of the Internet-gambling industry .<-->O
This is what we seek .<-->N
Precedents for regulation of our industry exist .<-->F
Online gambling is regulated in 64 countries , including the United Kingdom .<-->F
Gambling is a source of entertainment for millions of people around the world and has been for centuries .<-->F
Online , millions of people enjoy it every day .<-->F
We are asking to be regulated .<-->N
Prohibiting online gambling would be catastrophic .<-->N
Prohibiting the industry would have the exact opposite effect to what the congressman seeks .<-->N
Prohibition would not stop online gambling , it would send it underground and leave the vulnerable unprotected .<-->O
While Rep. Leach maintains that online gambling is illegal in the U.S. , the legal issues are not clear .<-->N
Rep. Leach is relying on an outdated , irrelevant law that is inapplicable and unenforceable for online gambling .<-->N
That is why we are looking for clear standards , regulations and licensing for what is an everyday entertainment medium enjoyed by millions .<-->N
Rep. Leach : Mr. Carruthers is correct that there is some imprecision in the Wire Act , which dates back to 1961 .<-->O
But there is little imprecision in the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1993 , which stipulates that it is `` unlawful for a person to sponsor , operate , or advertise ... any gambling scheme ... based on games in which amateur or professional athletes participate . ''<-->O
When he calls for `` regulation of our industry , '' he is really suggesting that gambling companies should be allowed to do legally what they are currently doing illegally .<-->O
He is also suggesting not only that the law of the U.S. -LRB- the above two referenced statutes -RRB- but similar laws that currently exist in all 50 states be overturned .<-->N
He suggests that prohibition would not stop online gambling , but `` send it underground and leave the vulnerable unprotected . ''<-->N
This is the case today .<-->N
The vulnerable are unprotected because companies that tap the American market violate our law and its protections .<-->O
No amount of regulation can address Web-based gaming 's particular intrusiveness and harm to the American home .<-->N
Internet gambling regulation can not work like traditional casino-based regulation .<-->N
Brick-and-mortar casinos have the means to keep kids and problem gamblers away .<-->N
But not an Internet casino .<-->N
The anonymity the Internet provides a gambler is unique and novel .<-->N
Regulation over the Internet would not have the effect of protecting underage or problem gamblers nor would it eliminate the money laundering problem or deal as comprehensively with the integrity of games .<-->O
Even if one concedes that a regulatory regime could attempt to address each of these things , the Internet is so pervasive and borderless that one country 's regulations are woefully insufficient .<-->O
Ultimately the result of regulating Internet gambling will be extending an industry which adds few advantages to the economy and many disadvantages to society .<-->N
It is no accident that supporters of the legislation I have introduced range from every major sporting organization -- the NFL , MLB , NHL , NBA , NCAA -- to the American Bankers Association to the Christian Coalition to the Episcopal , Presbyterian , Methodist , Baptist and Lutheran churches , to 48 of the 50 state attorneys general .<-->N
Mr. Carruthers : Gambling on the Internet is entertainment and a personal choice .<-->N
Why is the congressman trying to tell Americans what they can and can not do in the privacy of their own homes ?<-->N
Is n't he supposed to represent his constituents ?<-->N
According to the Wall Street Journal 's own poll on online gambling last month , 85 % of those polled believe Congress should not ban online gambling .<-->N
The fact that a small number of people gamble more than they should is not reason to prohibit the entertainment for every adult .<-->O
-LSB- Editor 's note : The poll Mr. Carruthers refers to was an informal online survey of WSJ.com readers ' opinions , and not a scientific sampling . -RSB-<-->N
Thinking that one can ban a form of entertainment on the Internet is ludicrous .<-->N
The Internet gives people access to the world and is a communications tool .<-->N
Ultimately , it is the individual in his or her own privacy who should be in control of their access to the Internet -- not any government .<-->N
There is no other institution that has more interest in preserving the integrity of sports than the online gambling industry .<-->N
Had the online gambling industry been in existence and been regulated , Pete Rose 's gambling problem , for example , would have been brought to the attention of authorities immediately .<-->O
My company currently maintains controls to protect the interest of our customers .<-->N
We utilize specific customer tracking controls that help customers assess and limit their own behavior , but also allow us to set limits for deposits and indicate a cooling off period for customers who may need it .<-->O
We train our customer relations employees to recognize excess or irregular behavior and address it immediately .<-->O
Regulation would standardize these best practices throughout the industry .<-->N
American consumers would then know which companies are licensed and which are not .<-->N
I would like to invite Rep. Leach and any of his colleagues to see our operations first-hand in Costa Rica .<-->N
This way , he can see directly the controls and practices we have in place .<-->N
We have found that once people are educated about our business , they are willing to work with us to address those social concerns that we all care about .<-->O
Rep. Leach : Entertainment is multi-dimensional , but gambling online is not the same as bowling .<-->N
No home , no office , no college dormitory should be a casino .<-->N
American law varies by state but generally makes no moral judgments on the wisdom of gambling .<-->O
The legislation I have introduced does not extend existing prohibitions on gambling ; it only provides an enforcement mechanism for laws on the books .<-->N
In a country of laws , upholding the law is fundamental .<-->N
In addition to protecting the rule of law , it is also fundamental for a society to protect the security of its citizens .<-->O
Here , it is relevant to note the testimony before Congress of Dennis Lormel , then chief of the FBI 's Financial Crimes Section : `` The Internet gambling and online capabilities have become a haven for money laundering activities .<-->N
We believe there is a huge potential for offshore sites being utilized to launder money , and there are examples of pending cases , particularly in our organized crime program , involving enterprises using these types of services as conduits for money laundering . ''<-->O
Likewise , in a formal report , the U.S. Department of State expressed a similar concern : `` The Internet gambling operations are , in essence , the functional equivalent of wholly unregulated offshore banks with the bettor accounts serving as bank accounts for account holders who are , in the virtual world , virtually anonymous .<-->O
For these reasons , Internet gambling operations are vulnerable to be used , not only for money laundering , but also criminal activities ranging from terrorist financing to tax evasion . ''<-->O
Mr. Carruthers 's invitation to visit the gambling operations of BetOnSports in Costa Rica may seem a generous gesture .<-->N
But for a congressman to accept it would be ethically dubious , if not illegal .<-->O
Mr. Carruthers : I take offense to the congressman 's unsubstantiated allegations about this industry and money laundering .<-->N
He talks about money laundering but does n't have any specific facts to back it up .<-->O
There have been absolutely no convictions of online gambling 's association with money laundering .<-->N
And , as a CEO of a multi-billion-dollar public company , it is clear that I follow very specific transparent reporting practices and governance procedures to run this company .<-->O
I have fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders and ethical responsibilities to my customers .<-->N
The congressman 's refusal to educate himself about the realities of our industry are disturbing .<-->N
Has he asked his constituents what they think about this kind of government invasion of their privacy and whether they want the government to ban online gambling ?<-->O
If he wo n't fund a poll to ask his constituents , then I will .<-->N
The fact is millions of Americans are now gambling online everyday .<-->N
They are enjoying this form of entertainment and doing it responsibly .<-->N
And if the congressman does not want to accept my invitation to visit our operations and see our effort first-hand , I suggest then that we get together in Washington .<-->O
I would like to meet him and tell him first hand all that we are doing to protect American citizens .<-->O
How could one possibly think of legislative action without knowing all the information ?<-->O
Mr. Carruthers adds : The fact is Americans account for 45 % of the consumers who bet online .<-->N
Overall , Americans wagered nearly $ 6 billion dollars online in 2005 , compared to $ 1.5 billion dollars in 2001 .<-->N
This is a thriving , legitimate and successful business that will not go away .<-->O
Trying to prohibit the online gaming industry is a futile exercise and waste of resources .<-->O
The constantly evolving structure of the Internet will make prohibition increasingly difficult , if not impossible .<-->O
Time could be much better spent establishing regulations to prevent underage gambling and protecting the vulnerable members of society from excessive and compulsive behavior .<-->O
These controls currently exist and the best operators use them .<-->N
Regulation and licensing would help standardize best practice across the board and allow the customer to differentiate the good operator from any bad operator .<-->O
There is a lot of hypocrisy in the effort to ban online gaming .<-->N
Some forms of online gaming are permitted -- state lotteries and horse racing , for example .<-->N
Regulation would bring clarity to efforts clouded with hypocrisy .<-->O
Regulation and licensing would set standards that demand businesses operate in the best interests of their customers , or they would not be licensed in the US .<-->O
The issue is : What are the most viable and effective ways to regulate a business that not only exists , but is growing ?<-->O
We have begun the process by working with the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution to spearhead the creation of an independent advisory council to bring together individuals from both sides of the argument in hopes of creating operating standards that could be acceptable to everyone .<-->O
Not only would regulation strengthen companies that wish to operate responsibly , licensing our companies would also bring billions of dollars of tax revenues to state and local budgets .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> Gambling should be abolished Gambling is the betting of money on an outcome that is wholly or largely random .<-->N
From ancient time , throwing a dice has been a form of gambling .<-->N
There is also gambling at established markets ; a cotton market is an example .<-->N
In modern time , gambling has extended into many fields .<-->N
For instance , speculation on a soccer game is nothing but gambling .<-->N
Gambling at horse races is very common and millions of money change hands in a day 's race ; and for every one gain there may be thousands of losers .<-->N
For example , the men and women populate at the storefronts ; when the results of a race are announced , there is no cheering .<-->N
Most of them silently drop their tickets to the floor or ripping them up ; a few unenthusiastically shuffle over to the payoff window .<-->N
It appears to be no fun at all .<-->N
Gambling maniac has spoiled many families and even affects a whole society .<-->N
Since gambling has been despised , no sensible man would indulge in it .<-->O
Gambling attracts people with little money who are desperate for a windfall ; people do it because a quick profit is expected .<-->O
Gambling may be defined as taking an artificial risk , hoping for excessive gain far beyond what the investment of time , money , or skill would justify .<-->O
When a man plays cards by way of gambling , he thinks he can make some quick and easy money .<-->N
Funfairs are gambling places .<-->N
People come to make some quick money .<-->F
Horse racing is a licensed gambling .<-->F
Thousands of people go to the races and bet their money on this horse or the other .<-->N
There are race addicts , who come and bet , without even realize that `` horse racing is carried out mainly for the delight and profit of fools , ruffians and thieves '' -LRB- George Gissing 236 -RRB- .<-->O
These are the people who can least afford to lose money .<-->O
They should be protected from the temptation to gamble because `` Gambling promises the poor what property performs for the rich something for nothing '' -LRB- Bernard Shaw -RRB- .<-->O
There are those who try and justify gambling by saying that all of life is a gamble .<-->O
They claim that the farmer who plants a crop is a gambler , business people who make investments in merchandise are undertaking a gamble , and persons who marry are entering into a relationship which is a gamble .<-->O
But the farmer , business persons , and marriage partners are not depending on chance .<-->N
They are using skill , energy , and knowledge to gain success .<-->O
No other person must suffer loss in order for these people to succeed .<-->O
In contrast , the gamblers ' success can only occur at the expense and suffering of others - someone else has to lose .<-->O
It is true that an element of risk exists even in legitimate undertakings ; but it is also true that farmers , business persons , and marriage partners do not normally cause others to suffer loss so that they can succeed .<-->O
They work hard to accomplish their goals .<-->N
Gambling is addictive .<-->N
Unlike drugs , gambling is not physically addictive but psychologically addictive .<-->N
Many people end up gambling to try to recover money they have already lost .<-->O
This is known as `` chasing losses '' .<-->N
It results in people betting more and more money ; most of which they `` will lose today , look forward to winning tomorrow , and if they win today , they can expect to lose tomorrow '' -LRB- Chico Marx -RRB- .<-->O
Internet gambling is even more dangerous .<-->N
Anyone can become addicted very easily - they do n't even need to leave their home .<-->O
This also means that they are gambling in private .<-->N
They may therefore be less reluctant to bet on very large sums they can not afford .<-->O
It is very hard to know the identity of an online gambler - there have been several cases of people -LRB- including children -RRB- using stolen credit cards to gamble online .<-->O
Gambling addicts often turn to crime to feed their addiction .<-->N
Addiction is highly damaging to families , since gamblers will spend whatever money they can on gambling .<-->O
People start to gamble without thinking that they will become addicted .<-->O
As with drugs , it is better to ban gambling to stop people getting started in the first place .<-->N
Gambling is often used to raise money for the state and for charity .<-->N
The major benefits of gambling usually come from profits and tax revenues from the casinos as well as possible price effects such as higher wages or housing prices in the local area .<-->O
Today , we see increasing acceptance of gambling .<-->N
The fund-raising through raffles , bingo , and even Las Vegas Nights keeps many churches from openly opposing to gambling ; the government can hardly call gambling a social menace because most states run lotteries .<-->O
It should also be recognized that many communities legalized casinos due to the poor economic conditions that were prevalent in the area and the lack of viable alternatives solution to boost their depressed economy .<-->O
Consequently , in some of the communities the casinos provided needed jobs , which reduced the unemployment rate that had been an intractable problem ; it also reduced the caseload of some social service agencies .<-->N
However , all of these do n't bear the weight of justification , because `` the view is very generally accepted is not a sufficient reason for accepting it as true '' -LRB- Tom Regan 688 -RRB- .<-->O
In fact , the economic benefits of casinos are often exaggerated .<-->N
The problems associated with casinos -LRB- e.g. crime , gambling addiction -RRB- outweigh the economic benefits .<-->O
In any case , an immoral industry is not justified by the fact that it creates employment .<-->O
Jobs could be created through many other industries that cause fewer moral and practical problems -LRB- e.g. theme parks -RRB- .<-->O
A major source of gambling revenues comes from the `` 10 percent of the population that gambles most heavily '' -LRB- Mustard -RRB- .<-->O
At least one in five compulsive gamblers file for bankruptcy after they have exhausted multiple credit cards and other lines of credit , often putting their families in jeopardy .<-->O
Lost productivity from sick days off for gambling is another cost borne by the local economy .<-->N
Between 21 and 36 percent of compulsive gamblers report losing a job because of their gambling habit , according to information from gambling treatment centers .<-->O
Casinos are often associated with criminal activity .<-->N
Drug dealers and prostitutes operate near casinos because they know that there are a large number of potential clients in the area .<-->O
Casinos can therefore be devastating to neighborhoods .<-->O
It is immoral for the state or charities to raise money by exploiting people 's stupidity and greed .<-->O
Taxing gambling is a regressive tax -LRB- this means that the poor pay a greater proportion of their income in tax than the rich -RRB- .<-->O
This is because poor people are more likely to gamble .<-->O
Regressive taxation is deeply unfair .<-->O

When it comes to making money , one has to draw a line between need and greed .<-->O
Gambling is something that blurs this line .<-->N
It tempts you to risk more in an attempt to win more and the cycle does not seem to end .<-->N
In case you lose money , you want to earn it back and in case you earn money , you are tempted to get more .<-->O
You get caught in this cycle and keep gambling for hours together .<-->N
And then you do it regularly .<-->F
You get addicted to it .<-->N
In the process , you may end up losing large amounts of money .<-->N
Even if you win , your greed to win more might never end .<-->O
The activity that started as a game of winning or losing money might take a bad turn and lead you to criminal activities .<-->O
Gambling may breed ill-practices that have adverse effects on your family and social life .<-->N
Perhaps , a good solution to prevent the ill-effects of gambling is to make it illegal .<-->N
Why Gambling Should Be Illegal Gambling is meant to serve as a recreation .<-->N
People engage in gambling activities to get rid of their problems , stress , and loneliness .<-->O
But most often , the contrary happens .<-->N
Gambling often turns out to be a thoughtless splurge of money and a waste of quality time .<-->N
It invites problems .<-->N
Gambling can lead people to crime .<-->N
Those addicted to gambling fail to think wisely before taking any decisions in life .<-->O
Their addiction forces them to risk huge amounts of money .<-->O
It may lead them to a stage where they can not stop themselves from betting money and valuables , in turn leading them to bankruptcy .<-->N
Those addicted to gambling are often seen giving up their jobs and careers , thus spoiling their lives .<-->N
Problem gamblers or compulsive gamblers as they can be called , feel compelled to bet money with the intent to win more and more .<-->O
Irrespective of whether they lose or win money , their addiction to gambling forces them to continue staking it .<-->N
It may land them into huge debts .<-->N
Lack of funds to repay the loans may leave them incapable of shouldering their responsibilities towards their family .<-->O
In this case , the family members either have to face hardships and economic problems , or they may decide to separate , sharing no responsibility of the money lost .<-->O
Gambling is so addictive , that it wo n't be wrong to compare it with drugs .<-->N
Similar to how substance abuse has devastating effects on a personal and social level , even gambling is detrimental to both these aspects of living .<-->O
Why not make it illegal ?<-->N
Though one may argue that gambling is only a means of recreation and that it should be taken as a form of entertainment , truth is that it is seldom taken that way .<-->O
Gamblers consider it to be a business , an investment , or a way to earn money .<-->N
They take irresponsible decisions about staking money and risk amounts they do n't even have .<-->O
This leads to huge debts they may never be able to repay .<-->O
The prohibition of gambling by law is an effective measure to discourage people from its damaging effects .<-->O
Money that could have been invested in better ways or put to better use is lost in gambling .<-->O
Money just changes hands between the gamblers and is never really put to good use .<-->O
It keeps circulating between those involved in gambling , and they keep switching between rich , richer , poor , and poorer .<-->N
Gambling can make the rich poor and the poor rich , within seconds ; that too , only out of luck .<-->O
It 's a fruitless activity actually .<-->O
But it is tempting to bet money , hoping for a bigger win every time .<-->N
The allurement is not easy to overcome .<-->N
And hence it 's best done by law .<-->N
Gambling leads people to borrow money and take secret loans for betting .<-->N
These practices can best be prevented through the use of rules .<-->N
Generally , people fear to do something that is illegal .<-->N
They prefer to remain away from something that is banned by law .<-->N
The same , on applying to gambling , can prevent or at least reduce the negative effects it has .<-->N
Hence , it should be made illegal .<-->N
Making gambling illegal can solve most of the problems associated with it .<-->O
It will keep a check on the prevalence of gambling practices .<-->N
Crime is best curbed through the use of law and order .<-->N
If addiction to gambling is entitled to punishment , gambling practices will become less prevalent or even stop .<-->O
Strict laws against gambling , and punishments or penalties to those caught , coupled with surveillance , can prevent the number of people indulging in gambling .<-->N
Many a time , law serves as the best stickler .<-->N

Yes : Michele Waslin , Senior Policy Analyst at the American Immigration Council 's Immigration Policy Center and former Director of Immigration Policy Research at the National Council of La Raza -LRB- NCLR -RRB- , in a Sep. 5 , 2003 WorldNetDaily article titled `` Davis to ` Legalize ' Illegal Aliens Today ?

We call on our new Governor and the members of the Legislature to work together for the common good of all Californians , and to craft appropriate legislation which both assures that proper security requirements are in place for all licensed drivers , and assists our immigrant workers and families in contributing to the prosperity of all in our State . ''<-->O
Dec. 1 , 2003 - Roger M. Mahony The Mexican American Legal Defence and Educational Fund -LRB- MALDEF -RRB- , in a Jan. 2004 presentation entitled `` Immigrant Access to State Driver s Licenses : A Tool Kit for Advocates , '' stated : `` Immigrant driver s license restrictions demonstrably do not deter illegal immigration , but they do cost lives .<-->N
State Departments of Motor Vehicles -LRB- DMVs -RRB- are charged with guaranteeing the safety of our roads and highways , but they neither have the resources to enforce , nor are they effective in enforcing , federal immigration policy ... While increasing our national security is critical , restricting driver licenses -LRB- DLs -RRB- is an inefficient way to enforce immigration laws and prevent terrorism ... Furthermore , press accounts since September 11 have called attention to the fact that the hijackers had obtained DLs when , in fact , the terrorists did not need U.S.-issued DLs to board the planes on September 11 ; they had foreign passports that allowed them to board .<-->O
In fact , denying driving licenses to large segments of the population makes everyone in the community less safe .<-->O
Restricting DLs results in unsafe roads , higher insurance rates , and overwhelmed court systems ... Restricting DLs results in the proliferation of false documents . ''<-->O
Jan. 2004 - Mexican American Legal Defence and Educational Fund -LRB- MALDEF -RRB- The Center for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology Policy , in an Dec. 17 , 2004 press release entitled `` Not Issuing Driver 's Licenses to Illegal Aliens Is Bad for National Security , '' offered : `` If 13 million people living within our borders ca n't drive , fly , travel on a train or bus , or otherwise participate in society without a driver 's license and they can not get a legitimate one , then the market will supply them an illegal fraudulent one ... On the other hand , if illegal aliens are allowed to get legitimate licenses upon thorough vetting of their identity , then the only ones who will be trying to get fraudulent documents will be terrorists or criminals ... Fourteen states currently allow driver 's licenses to be obtained without showing ` legal presence . '<-->O
These laws were enacted for public safety reasons -- to ensure that drivers meet some standard to drive and to lower insurance premiums by decreasing the pool of unlicensed and uninsured drivers ... The analogous arguments hold for national security -- the more we can encourage otherwise law abiding people within our borders to participate in the system the easier it will be to identify those that pose a true threat . ''<-->O
No : Arnold Schwarzenegger , 38th .<-->N
Governor of California , in a May 23 , 2006 speech retrieved from the Office of the Governor website regarding the upcoming visit of Mexican President Vicente Fox to California , offered the following remarks : `` I 'm against the driver 's license for undocumented immigrants ... until we can prove who the people are , we can not give driver 's licenses because of security problems that we have .<-->O
When we can prove that , when we can see who is that person , and then can do the background check , then we can go into that and say , ` Okay , now we can go and give a driver 's license . ' ''<-->N
May 23 , 2006 - Arnold Schwarzenegger Elaine Alquist , MA , California State Senator -LRB- D-San Jose -RRB- , introduced a state bill SB 976 , on Mar. 5 , 1993 , which in section 1 , subsection -LRB- d -RRB- mandated : `` The department shall not issue or renew a driver 's license or identification card to any person who does not establish proof that he or she is a citizen or a legal resident of the United States ... It is a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly assist in obtaining a driver 's license or identification card for any person who is not a citizen or legal resident of the United States under federal law . ''<-->N
-LSB- Editor 's note : This bill was signed into law by 36th Governor of California Pete Wilson on Oct. 4 , 1993 -RSB- Mar. 5 , 1993 - Elaine Alquist , MA SB 976 -LRB- 10 KB -RRB- Cass Ballenger , MBA , U.S. Representative -LRB- R-NC -RRB- , in a Sep. 17 , 2002 press release on his co-sponsored Drivers License Integrity Act , H.R. 5322 , argued : `` In too many cases a person 's immigration status is not even an issue in granting a license or ID .<-->O
Clearly , we must address that shortcoming , as it has direct bearing on our national security ... A driver 's license or state identification card is an essential tool , used by illegal aliens to solidify their presence here and to move about freely .<-->O
This is a clear threat to our safety and economic security . ''<-->O
Sep. 17 , 2002 - Cass Ballenger , MBA H.R. 5322 -LRB- 11 KB -RRB- The Federation for American Immigration Reform -LRB- FAIR -RRB- , in an Oct. 2005 website section titled `` Driver 's License Security , '' offered the following : `` In an increasingly security-conscious America , access to driver 's licenses by people in the country illegally poses serious risks and undermines U.S. immigration law .<-->O
Proponents of issuing driver s licenses to illegal aliens have argued that it would improve national security and road safety .<-->O
The security argument is spurious , because illegal aliens often use aliases and phony documents , so the alien s identity and residence is not established as a result of the driver s license process ... The argument about road safety relies on a faulty assumption that if illegal aliens are legally licensed to drive , they will all have accident insurance .<-->O
But even if a state requires automobile insurance as a condition of getting a license , that does not keep an illegal alien from canceling the policy the next day .<-->N
Illegal aliens generally are working in low-wage jobs and have difficulty affording insurance , and their cars are frequently older and more accident-prone .<-->N
Additionally , illegal aliens often are not able to read road alerts in English .<-->N
In many of the countries from which illegal aliens come , it is standard practice for motorists involved in accidents to flee the scene .<-->N
The combination of these factors adds up to the probability that , if more illegal aliens were encouraged to drive by issuing them driver s licenses , it would lead to more accidents caused by uninsured motorists and many would be hit and run . ''<-->O
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> Illegal immigrants should be able to KEEP THEIR LICENSE !!!!! I think `` immigrants '' should be able to keep their driver 's license because they have been working hard to be able to live in this country .<-->O
Plus they are discriminated against just because they are `` illegal '' and because they are not white !<-->O
Many `` illegal immigrants '' have worked very hard to be able to have their families live a good life .<-->O
The `` illegal immigrants '' that live here came here for a reason .<-->O
I am pretty sure that reason was n't to be discriminated against or to have things taken away from them .<-->O
These `` illegal immigrants , '' as everybody calls them , actually have to work harder then `` legal '' people .<-->N
The `` illegal immigrants '' work in oil fields and in other jobs that many `` legal '' people do not want to work in because it is too much work or it does n't pay enough .<-->O
You know the people that are `` legal '' have it easier , so even if the `` illegal immigrants '' are all deported , who will work in oil fields , clean offices and schools , or work in other jobs like that ?<-->O
I am pretty sure it wo n't be you , because it does n't pay enough .<-->O
`` Illegal immigrants '' have to work harder to get what `` legal '' people get .<-->N
So taking away their licenses wo n't make everything better .<-->N
At least `` illegal immigrants '' get and use licenses unlike other people who drive without a license .<-->O
If you think `` illegal immigrants '' drive illegally just because they are `` illegal , '' you make me laugh .<-->O
So I will do whatever it takes to make sure that they do not have their licenses taken away !<-->O
Are you kidding !?<-->N
Absolutely not !<-->N
Ever heard the phrase , `` driving is a privilage , not a right '' .<-->N
Arrest and deport is the only answer to this growing problem .<-->N
No US citizen should have to compete with illegals for anything .<-->N
Not food , housing , health care , schooling , JOBS - NOTHING !<-->N
Illegals have ZERO rights to anything in America and that includes driving a car on our roads .<-->N
They should n't be given more rights when they pay no taxes .<-->N
Illegal immigrants do n't pay taxes or even have Social Security ... These means they are hiking along for ALL the same privileges as honest tax-paying Americans , but with out the taxes .<-->O
The biggest issue is in insurance ... If you get in a car wreck with an illegal immigrant , your screwed ... He has no identification or insurance to pay for your car .<-->N
We should n't give equal right to people who are n't paying their fair share and did n't even come here legally .<-->O
It is the right thing to do .<-->N
While we might think it wrong , it is the right thing to do .<-->O
We must put aside all out differences and consider that this is the right humane thing to do .<-->O
Humanity must change its mentality and remember that those who broke the law are still humans and deserve another chance .<-->O
As a matter of fact they broke the law with the intention of making a better life .<-->O
It is because America has stood for equality and opportunity that so many are drawn to it and it is for that reason many would risk breaking the law to be part of America .<-->O
Consider it a privilege that so many want to be part of America .<-->O
At the end of it all , we will be making life better for friends , family , school mates , partners and our neighbors .<-->O
USA needs to do their job Illegals can not read or write English and therefore can not take a test or read road signs .<-->N
USA should not be accomodating spanish speaking or any other language by allowing them to take tests in their own language .<-->N
Additionally Illegals should be deported as they have now committed a crime by entering the USA illegally .<-->O
If Luis Guiterrez in Illinois wishes to be an advocate for Illegals , he should move to Mexico and take his stance there .<-->O
The only thing illegal immigrants should get is deported .<-->N
I do n't know why people advocate giving things to illegal immigrants , just get rid of them .<-->O
The immigration system needs reform , but in no way are we bound to respect people who decide to ignore our laws for their own benefit .<-->O
It does n't matter if you 're paying taxes and bills , you 're still breaking the law .<-->N
For some reason , it seems to me that people like to ignore the `` illegal '' part in `` illegal immigration '' .<-->O
Of course they should !!<-->N
First of all illegal immigrants should be able to get a drivers license .<-->O
A lot of people are saying that that illegal immigrants are criminals , that is one of the stupidest thing I 've ever heard .<-->N
I being living in California for 17 years and most of the criminals I seen on the news and in person were US citizens .<-->N
I think that if illegal immigrants have a criminal record they should n't but that 's not all immigrants , A lot work hard and they deserve a driving license .<-->O
No Way - Jose -LRB- pardon the pun -RRB- ILLEGAL means you are breaking the law , you are a criminal , albeit not a convicted one because in may areas you can not arrest or even detain an illegal immigrant .<-->O
THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST LAW THAT IS ENFORCED .<-->N
Why do the law abiding tax payers have to support these illegals .<-->N
We do the charitable thing and support our own criminals in our prisons .<-->O
You have to draw the line somewhere .<-->N
Ship them all out , like cargo , not passengers .<-->N
Drivers license for illegal immigrants ?<-->N
It 's surprising to me that this is even a valid question .<-->O
I already know a certain group will jump on my back for stating my opinion so for those I speak of say what you will , it matters not!OK , the simple answer ... Because they are illegally in the country !<-->O
What other countries tolerate illegal immigration like the U.S. Does ?<-->O
Maybe Britain , other than that none !<-->N
Before those of you from Mexico run your mouths , why do n't you educate yourselves on how your country treats illegal immigration then come and talk to me .<-->N
I 've noticed on this thread the worn out tired statement that Americans are lazy and illegals do the jobs Americans do n't want .<-->O
This has validity to an extremely small degree .<-->N
I 've been in the construction business for many years and witness first hand the FACTS !<-->N
Illegal immigrants take jobs from skilled quality workers on a large scale !<-->N
No , not because Americans do n't want to work but because Americans can not financially compete with a group of people who can afford to work for low wages because often times they have multiple families sharing the expense of one household .<-->O
I 've personally witnessed this scenario time and again so it 's pointless to try and deny this as it is as factual as it gets .<-->O
I can not blame people for pursuing a better life but I have .<-->O
A big problem with it when it 's at the expense of people who are in America legally .<-->N
Secondly , it sure seems to me that the immigrants from the Latin group want nothing to do with being American , it seems as though most want to come here and push America to conform to their ways !<-->O
So if they want to benefit from the society my ancestors built but do n't want to put forth any effort to be American then why the hell should they deserve an American drivers license ?<-->O
Of course they should !<-->N
Many of you do n't know why these people come to the US .<-->N
They live in very poor conditions and that is the only choice they have .<-->O
And to the people that think that you can just go to an office and get a valid SSN you are very wrong .<-->O
It takes many years to go through the process .<-->N
If illegal immigrants are driving on our roads we might as well grant them the privilege to drive .<-->O
If we granted them that privilege there would be less hit and run accidents and they would carry insurance .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ >> People in the western state of California who are in the United States illegally can now request a driver s license .<-->N
More than a million people are expected to seek the special license .<-->N
California is not the first American state with such a law , but it has the largest number of illegal immigrants .<-->N
Many people began to request licenses shortly after the new state law went into effect .<-->N
Many people stood in long lines .<-->N
Among them was Christian Alvarado .<-->N
It is so exciting .<-->N
For a long time -LRB- I have been -RRB- waiting for the license .<-->N
Mr. Alvarado entered the United States from El Salvador eight years ago without permission from the U.S. government .<-->N
Some call such people illegal immigrants .<-->N
Others call them undocumented immigrants .<-->N
Mr. Alvarado works as a gardener .<-->N
This is the first time he has been able to seek a driver s license in the U.S. .<-->N
He must prove his identity and show that he lives in California to start the process .<-->O
He must also take an eye test to show he can see well , and a written test on driving rules .<-->O
He must also take a driving test to show he can operate a motor vehicle .<-->N
If he is successful , he will get a driver s license .<-->N
Mr. Alvarado says he will then be able to drive without fear .<-->O
You are always afraid about the police .<-->N
-LRB- They -RRB- can stop you and take your car and you have to pay a lot of money to get back the car .<-->N
Police once caught Mr. Alvarado driving without a license .<-->N
He says he had to pay a fine of $ 800 .<-->F
Many immigrants in California drove without a license before the new law took effect .<-->F
Jaime Rodriguez is one of them .<-->F
He says he had to drive because of his job , which supports his family .<-->N
You live with fear sometimes , and you need to do it -LRB- drive -RRB- .<-->O
You need to live .<-->O
Yidara Pisano is employed as a caregiver of children .<-->N
She says with a license she can drive without fear of having her car taken away from her .<-->N
The law went into effect January 1 .<-->N
Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have requested licenses since then .<-->N
But some are worried that their personal information will be used to find them and deport them .<-->O
Armando Botello is a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles , or DMV .<-->N
He says people should not be afraid .<-->N
He says the California DMV generally does not share such information .<-->N
He says it will do so only if officials request information about someone being investigated for their possible role in a serious crime .<-->O
The new license is the same as licenses given to citizens except that it has the words Federal Limits Apply .<-->N
That means the license can not be used to travel on an airplane or enter a federal building .<-->F
Ana Garcia works at the Central American Resource Center .<-->N
She says some illegal immigrants fear those words will be used to abuse them .<-->O
There s just also another fear that , you know , they re going to be treated differently , they re going to be discriminated against or that , you know , or just a regular police officer can , you know , see that they re undocumented and then call immigration themselves .<-->O
Civil rights groups say police and others are not permitted to act against people who have the special license .<-->O
Dan Schnur is a political scientist at the University of Southern California .<-->N
He told VOA that the main argument against the new law is that it rewards illegal behavior .<-->O
But Professor Schnur says public opinion in California has changed .<-->N
He says young people have different feelings about undocumented immigrants than older Americans .<-->N
He says young , white Americans generally support immigration reform , including giving driver s licenses to illegal immigrants .<-->O
simply because they grew up in a much different type of society , a much more multicultural society , than their parents or their grandparents did .<-->O
Professor Schnur says he believes the changes in beliefs about illegal immigrants that have taken place in California will spread throughout the United States .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> A bill to create a limited purpose driver license for undocumented immigrants and other people lacking the usually required identification is awaiting a floor vote in the Hawaii House of Representatives .<-->O
Supporters say House Bill 1007 , which was introduced by Rep. Henry Aquino , would result in fewer unlicensed and uninsured drivers .<-->O
Paola Rodelas is one of those supporters after being the victim of an unlicensed , uninsured driver .<-->N
She was driving with her father on Interstate 5 in San Diego when a car swerved the side of her car .<-->N
Fortunately , no one had serious injuries , but it turned out that the driver of the other car was a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant .<-->N
Rodelas sympathized , because she used to be an undocumented immigrant .<-->N
She moved with her family from the Philippines when she was 2 , but didn t become a naturalized citizen until she was 16 , she said .<-->N
Like the teen who hit their car , she also had to work to help her family when she was a teenager .<-->N
Had I not gotten my citizenship and my driver s license , I likely would have made the choice to drive without a license , Rodelas said in written testimony for the bill .<-->O
The bill had been awaiting a hearing in conference committee , but House officials announced Monday they are willing to accept amendments attached when it passed the Senate .<-->N
A similar bill , the Safe and Responsible Driver s Act , was introduced last year but not passed .<-->N
The license would only be valid for driving in Hawaii and could not be used as federal ID for registering to vote or receiving public benefits .<-->O
Protecting All Drivers Approximately 3.1 percent of Hawaii s population can not show proof of lawful presence in the United States , according to the Hawaii Appleseed Center .<-->N
And a 2011 study by Pew Research found that 4.6 percent of Hawaii s labor force is made up of undocumented workers .<-->N
So far , 11 states , as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia , have enacted legislation that provides access to a driver s license regardless of immigration status , according to Phocused , a non-profit organization that advocates on behalf of low-income and underprivileged people .<-->N
Claudia Lara , who grew up on Maui , submitted written testimony in support of HB 1007 , saying that having a driver s license is vital to daily life , especially in rural areas on neighbor islands .<-->O
Regardless of someone s legal status we need to be sure that everyone on the road is safe and capable of driving .<-->O
Jenny Lee , Hawaii Appleseed Center When Lara was a child , her mother was undocumented , so her family depended on her mother s boyfriend for everyday tasks like driving to the grocery store , doctor s appointments and taking Lara and her sister to school , she said .<-->O
Lara s mother established legal residency and is now a licensed driver who now drives unlicensed people s children to school and picks up groceries for them , Lara said .<-->N
But when my mom isn t available to help , what else can our friends do , than be forced to drive untested , unlicensed , and uninsured on our roads ?<-->O
Lara said in her testimony .<-->N
What do they do when their children have emergencies and they can not take them to the hospital or pick up their medicine ?<-->N
Advocates of the bill say it won t only help Hawaii s immigrant population it will help protect all drivers .<-->O
They say that it would ensure that more people on the road are equipped with the skills to drive .<-->O
HB 1007 would establish limited-purpose instructional permits and provisional driver s licenses for teens , in addition to the limited-purpose driver s license .<-->N
More licensed drivers on the road could mean more insured drivers , Jenny Lee of the Hawaii Appleseed Center told Civil Beat .<-->O
Unlicensed drivers are almost five times more likely to be in a fatal crash than are validly licensed drivers , according to the AAA Foundation .<-->N
Reasons for Lacking ID Vary Besides people who are living undocumented in Hawaii , the bill would help anyone who might have trouble getting all the proper documentation for a driver s license , such as domestic violence survivors , elderly residents and U.S. citizens in poverty who lack proper identification , Lee said .<-->O
Regardless of someone s legal status we need to be sure that everyone on the road is safe and capable of driving , Lee said .<-->O
HB 1007 will improve public safety by ensuring all drivers are tested for driving skills and able to acquire motor vehicle insurance , the Hawaii Department of Transportation said in written testimony .<-->O
Had I not gotten my citizenship and my driver s license , I likely would have made the choice to drive without a license .<-->O
Paola Rodelas Galen Onouye , the licensing administrator for the city s Department of Customer Services , testified in support of HB 1007 , but he suggested that the bill should require that limited-purpose licenses have a unique design and color to distinguish them from current Hawaii driver s licenses .<-->O
Big Island Police Chief Harry Kubojiri opposed the bill , saying it was crafted to help people who have made a conscious effort to violate Federal laws .<-->N
We believe this measure will have the effect of inviting even more undocumented foreign nationals to our state in direct violation of Federal Law , Kubojiri said in written testimony .<-->O
But supporters say the bill would actually help law enforcement and emergency responders if more people have a form of identification .<-->O
Every time a police officer stops someone who has no identification , it requires additional manpower to determine the identity of an arrestee , said Khara Jabola Carolus , legislative coordinator for the Hawaii Coalition for Immigration Reform .<-->N
A driver s license increases the willingness of immigrant witnesses and victims to cooperate with law enforcement officers and assist in criminal investigations , said Carolus in written testimony .<-->O
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> After a new law went into effect in January , more than half of all new driver 's licenses issued in California this year have gone to people who are in the country illegally , the state said Friday .<-->N
The California Department of Motor Vehicles reported it has issued roughly 397,000 licenses to people who live in the country illegally .<-->N
A total of 759,000 licenses were issued in the first six months of the year .<-->N
The DMV did not immediately have licensing numbers for 2014 .<-->N
The new law initially generated huge interest , with long lines at DMV offices in January and February .<-->O
The DMV expects to see about one million more applicants over the next three years who are covered under the new law .<-->N
`` We hope that all of those people will be able to pass the testing and have the necessary documents to obtain '' a license , said DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez .<-->O
Supporters of the law say giving licenses to people regardless of their immigration status makes the roads safer for everyone .<-->N
New drivers say having a license means they can travel more freely for work or pleasure .<-->N
Some people had been driving without a license .<-->N
`` It 's great that people are taking advantage of this new law , '' said Jackelin Aguilar , community organizer for Placer People of Faith Together , an Auburn , California-based group that supports the new licenses .<-->N
`` It 's definitely a step forward for the families , and having identification is huge , '' Aguilar said .<-->N
Opponents say people who are in the country illegally should not be rewarded .<-->N
Roy Beck , president of NumbersUSA , which advocates for legal and limited immigration , chided California for making life easier for people in the country illegally , at the expense of citizens and legal residents .<-->O
`` There are now 400,000 more signals to people all over the world that working illegally in California is encouraged by the government itself , '' he said .<-->N
About 687,000 people have applied for the licenses issued to illegal immigrants .<-->N
Applicants must pass driving tests and show proof of residency and identity .<-->N
The new license is marked differently than those issued to other drivers in the state and is not considered a valid form of federal identification , for example , to board an airplane .<-->N
More than 1.1 million people who qualify for the new licenses took the written driver 's test between Jan. 2 and June 30 , and 436,000 have also taken a behind-the-wheel driving test .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> In Colorado , Oregon , and California , the granting of driver 's licenses to illegal aliens has generated controversy and raised national security concerns that have gone largely unreported .<-->O
Colorado : Over two months ago , an ID company , MorphoTrust , erroneously issued 524 standard Colorado driver 's licenses to illegal aliens .<-->N
Under federal law , driver 's licenses issued to illegal aliens are required to have a marking that indicates they are not to be used for federal purposes , but these did not .<-->N
MorphoTrust which produces IDs for 42 states has been trying to get the licenses back by offering $ 100 gift cards to those who return them .<-->N
I was able to confirm through a Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles -LRB- DMV -RRB- official that 189 licenses had remained unaccounted for , but the latest update is that 43 licenses are outstanding .<-->N
The federal REAL ID Act which put a number of recommendations from the 9/11 Commission into effect standardizes state driver 's licenses and seeks to prevent illegal aliens from boarding airplanes , entering government buildings or accessing nuclear power plants .<-->O
But illegal immigration advocates have pushed some states to offer special driver 's licenses just for illegal aliens that are not REAL ID compliant .<-->O
The movement is part of the effort to blur the distinction between law-abiding residents and foreigners who believe they are above the law .<-->O
The Colorado DMV tells me that they have gone door to door as part of the retrieval effort , which is commendable , but the question of what happens if all cards can not be located looms large .<-->N
Some have argued the error might allow the recipients to register to vote and/or get additional licenses in other states .<-->O
If people wishing to do harm to Americans have any of these licenses , they are not going to give them up willingly .<-->O
Oregon : After Oregon legislators moved forward with a plan to grant driver 's licenses to illegal aliens , a group opposed to the proposal gathered enough signatures to put the issue up to a public vote .<-->N
Polling suggests that nearly two-thirds of Oregon voters oppose the plan .<-->N
This , despite the fact that supporters have spent over 11 times as much money as opponents .<-->O
A big controversy erupted when the fact-checking group PolitiFact decided to look into claims made by radio host Lars Larson that the proposed licenses would allow illegal aliens to board airplanes .<-->O
PolitiFact determined that Larson is correct after speaking with a Transportation Security Administration -LRB- TSA -RRB- official .<-->N
The problem is that language on the ballot actually states that Measure 88 would not allow illegal aliens to board planes .<-->O
This language was written by the American Civil Liberties Union -LRB- ACLU -RRB- , which has not posted an explanation or apology on its website -LRB- and it remains unclear whether the error was by accident or by design -RRB- .<-->N
The TSA official has not explained exactly why the licenses would allow illegal aliens to board planes , but a couple of factors are likely at play .<-->O
First , the Department of Homeland Security -LRB- DHS -RRB- has repeatedly given compliance deadline extensions to at least 21 states and territories , extensions that were supposed to have expired on Oct. 10 , 2014 .<-->N
But states can reapply for the extensions -LRB- Massachusetts , Kentucky and Montana recently received extensions -RRB- .<-->N
Oregon also had an extension , but it is unclear whether the state has received yet another one .<-->N
Second , DHS has dragged its feet on enforcing the REAL ID Act and under their current plans , noncompliant IDs will prevent people from boarding airplanes `` no sooner than 2016 . ''<-->N
The REAL ID Act law was enacted in 2005 and supposed to take effect in 2008 .<-->N
It should also be noted that the proposed measure would instruct the Oregon Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division to accept foreign consular IDs as proof of an illegal alien 's identity .<-->O
These consular IDs are completely unverifiable by U.S. officials and have been considered a national security threat by the FBI .<-->O
California : One open-border group helped create driver 's licenses so dangerous to national security that DHS stopped their design from going forward .<-->O
The REAL ID Act allows states some freedom in how they differentiate between a regular driver 's license and ones reserved for illegal immigrants that are not valid for federal purposes .<-->O
Advocates of illegal immigration have been demanding that states make the licenses given to illegal aliens look almost identical to the licenses given to legal residents , even though it makes a security officer 's job more difficult .<-->O
California 's plan was to make the driver 's license for illegal aliens look identical , save for one tiny difference : the small , 6-point-font text on the card that reads `` DL '' -LRB- meaning `` Driver s License '' -RRB- would simply be switched to read `` DP '' -LRB- meaning `` Driving Privilege '' -RRB- .<-->O
The difference is nearly imperceptible as my mock-up illustrates .<-->N
That California would conclude the interests of illegal aliens are so important that it 's worth increasing the chances the TSA would miss the denotation is troubling .<-->O
All four passenger jets involved in the 9/11 attack were bound for California and many Californians lost their lives that day .<-->N
Just recently , DHS approved a more distinctive version of the driver 's license that reportedly will have the words `` FEDERAL LIMITS APPLY '' written on the front .<-->N
Some states orient the IDs vertically , which really helps to differentiate from regular licenses .<-->N
Pro-illegal immigration groups oppose these measures because they fear illegal aliens will be treated differently than those who are here legally .<-->O
Of course , illegal aliens are supposed to be treated differently they 're to be deported in accordance with federal law .<-->O
Unfortunately , many activist groups and politicians have concluded that helping illegal aliens hide their lawlessness is more important than preventing another 9/11 .<-->O
Congress should consider tightening up the REAL ID standards .<-->N
If problems like this continue , it would n't be surprising if voters in many states initiated referenda or legislation aimed at stopping the issuance of driver 's licenses to people in the country illegally .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> Illegal Immigrants Account for Over Half of California Driver s Licenses Issued in 2015 Fifty-two percent of all new driver s licenses issued in the state of California thus far this year have been awarded to illegal immigrants .<-->N
According to the Associated Press , the California Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed Friday that approximately 397,000 licenses had been issued to illegal immigrants in the first six months of 2015 after a law went into effect allowing the DMV to issue licenses to undocumented immigrant workers in the state .<-->N
In total , 759,000 licenses were issued by the DMV in the first half 2015 , a more than 174 percent increase over the 435,000 licenses handed out in the first six months of 2014 .<-->N
Officials estimate that 1 million more illegals to whom the law applies will become applicants for licenses over the next three years .<-->N
Assembly Bill 60 , which was passed in 2013 and went into effect in January , requires the DMV to issue an original driver s license to a person who is unable to submit satisfactory proof that the applicant s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law .<-->O
California Gov. Jerry Brown held two ceremonies to celebrate his signing of the law in 2013 during which he described the state as a dream .<-->O
In order to become an applicant for the licenses , illegal immigrants covered by the law must pass a driving test and prove their residency and identity .<-->O
Since the law took effect , 687,000 individuals have applied for the licenses , which are marked differently than those given to U.S. citizens in the state so that individuals who use them can not board airplanes or perform other tasks that require federal identification .<-->N
Between Jan. 2 and June 30 , more than 1.1 million illegals covered by the law took written driver s tests and 436,000 have also submitted to road driving tests .<-->N
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >> Drivers licenses for illegal immigrants now accepted as employment documents A change in guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services makes driver s licenses for illegals acceptable ID for employment , creating a new shortcut for illegal immigrants to get jobs .<-->O
Federal law prohibits employers from hiring illegal immigrants .<-->N
However , a recent change by USCIS requires employers to accept driver s privilege cards as proof of identity , even though the cards are uniquely granted to individuals with no legal presence in the country .<-->O
According to guidance USCIS issued in May , a driver privilege card issued by a state is an acceptable List B document for I-9 employment forms if it contains a photograph or identifying information such as name , date of birth , sex , height , color of eyes , and address .<-->O
Ten states issue some form of driver s license to illegal immigrants .<-->N
While the credentials are designated for driving purposes only , the updated federal guidance means the cards now qualify as documents for obtaining work .<-->N
In effect , what has happened here , is USCIS has created a shortcut for illegal immigrants to obtain employment .<-->N
Now all they need is work authorization , which can be obtained by a counterfeit birth certificate , Andrew Meehan , policy director for Keeping Identities Safe , told Vermont Watchdog .<-->N
Keeping Identities Safe , a nonpartisan crime-prevention group that specializes in secure IDs , claims states have issued nearly half a million driver s licenses to illegals .<-->N
Hundreds of thousands of applications are currently pending .<-->N
Meehan says the development has significant implications for America s labor force .<-->N
This could have a very real economic impact on the United States .<-->O
These are very subtle changes that are not being debated even in a proposed rule or even in Congress .<-->O
We re talking about what could potentially be a million people who may be looking for work using these licenses .<-->N
According to data from Keeping Identities Safe , the states with the most licenses in circulation are California -LRB- 341,000 -RRB- , Illinois -LRB- 95,991 -RRB- , Maryland -LRB- 38,013 -RRB- and Nevada -LRB- 23,066 -RRB- .<-->N
Vermont , which has issued more than 40,000 driver s privilege cards , offers its credential to citizens and undocumented immigrants alike , making it impossible to track how many licenses get issued to illegal immigrants .<-->O
Under federal law , employers who hire illegal aliens face criminal and civil fines , loss of business license and even jail time .<-->O
The new guidance from USCIS creates a dilemma for employers who on the one hand are prohibited from hiring illegals and on the other hand are required to accept documents uniquely issued to undocumented immigrants .<-->O
While employers must now accept driver s privilege cards , doing so does not necessarily expose them to prosecution should they hire an illegal alien , according to the USCIS guidance .<-->O
The fact that an employee presents or an employer accepts a driver privilege or authorization card that meets Form I-9 requirements as a List B identity document does not , in and of itself , support a conclusion that the employer had actual or constructive knowledge -LRB- i.e. knew or should have known -RRB- that an employee is not employment authorized , the guidance states .<-->O
Meehan said while the change does not necessarily put employers at risk of prosecution , it does expose them to nearly unstoppable fraud .<-->O
Since USCIS classifies driver s privilege cards as a List B document , job applicants who possess the cards must provide one additional document to employers a List C document to show authorization for work .<-->O
Meehan says the most common List C document is the birth certificate , which is among the easiest documents to counterfeit .<-->N
There are 6,000 different entities issuing over 9,000 different types of birth certificates across the United States .<-->N
Recognizing a counterfeit birth certificate from a legitimate birth certificate is almost impossible , he said .<-->N
So you have employers now who are going to be able to say , Well , I m not a fraudulent document examiner .<-->N
It was printed on what looked to be security paper .<-->N
I accepted it as proof of authorization to work in the United States .<-->F
Meehan said since USCIS , e-Verify and the Department of Labor don t have systems to confirm all those document sources , employers have no way to verify the birth certificate of any job applicant .<-->N
Moreover , he added that creating a counterfeit birth certificate is as easy as purchasing security paper at a local Staples and printing birth information on it .<-->N
Despite the blurred lines created by the new guidance , it s possible that employers can accept driver s privilege cards for I-9 forms and comply with federal law prohibiting the hiring of illegals .<-->O
Vermont issues driver s privilege cards to both citizens and illegals , meaning many of those credentials are tied to valid job applicants .<-->N
Moreover , some individuals without legal presence may obtain valid work authorization through other government channels .<-->N
However , Meehan said the ease with which illegals may obtain a driver s privilege card and a fake a birth certificate is certain to create a pathway to work for hundreds of thousands of ineligible applicants .<-->O
What we see is a pattern here to add legitimacy to these licenses .<-->N
Many states , Vermont included , when they pass legislation , they often include language that says , Listen , this is to be used for driving and nothing else .<-->N
You can t use it to obtain state benefits , firearms or employment , he said .<-->N
And yet , what USCIS has done is add a very real legitimacy to these licenses and allowed them to be used for something that they were never intended to be used for .<-->O
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ >> Illegal Immigrants Rush to Get Driver s Licenses in California LOS ANGELES Hundreds camped outside overnight to be among the first inside .<-->N
When the doors opened , the crowd rushed into the building .<-->F
This wasn t a Black Friday sale .<-->F
It was the first day California allowed immigrants in the state illegally to apply for a driver s license .<-->N
On Jan. 2 , the state s Department of Motor Vehicles began tackling a surge of such applicants , complying with a new law allowing those who prove they reside here to qualify for a driver s license regardless of immigration status .<-->O
In the first three days , 46,200 people applied .<-->N
Thousands braved long lines as walk-ins .<-->N
Others , like Wilian Monroy , a Guatemalan car mechanic in the U.S. for 14 years , had scheduled an appointment .<-->N
At a Los Angeles DMV office Tuesday , he clutched a folder containing his passport , utility bills and bank statements to prove his identity and California residency .<-->N
He had arrived at 11 a.m. for his 1 p.m. appointment .<-->N
It s a big day for me , said the 35-year-old .<-->F
Overseeing the line was DMV manager Kathy Myles-Daniels , who said her branch was the busiest I ve ever seen it .<-->N
Statewide , 1.4 million illegal immigrants are expected to apply for licenses over the next three years .<-->F
To prepare , the DMV has hired 900 additional staff , dispatched representatives to do outreach in immigrant communities and erected four new mega-sized branches .<-->N
In doing so , California joins nine other states , Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia in issuing licenses to undocumented immigrants .<-->N
Supporters say it promotes road safety ; critics say it legitimizes illegal immigrants .<-->N
Granting driver s licenses to illegal aliens is a further attempt ... to normalize the status of illegal aliens , said Ira Mehlman , media director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , a national group that lobbies against legalizing undocumented immigrants .<-->O
For decades , many states with large immigrant populations issued driver s licenses to foreigners regardless of their immigration status .<-->N
In California , undocumented residents could get licenses until 1994 , when debate over illegal immigration began to flare .<-->O
Other states began to crack down amid heightened security concerns after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .<-->O
About 40 % of the nation s foreign-born individuals now live in a state that offers licenses to residents regardless of status .<-->N
Currently , some states with large illegal-immigrant populations , like Texas and Arizona , don t issue licenses to undocumented residents , while Illinois , Maryland and Washington are among those that do .<-->O
Offering licenses has become a less polarizing issue in some states as law enforcement , the auto-insurance industry and policy makers in those states have expressed support .<-->O
The worst day is when you get in an accident and look up to see the other person drove off because they are undocumented and unlicensed , said Dan Dunmoyer , head of government and industry affairs at Farmers Insurance .<-->O
If people are driving to their jobs , because they have to , it s good for them and other motorists that they be tested , licensed and insured .<-->N
Across the country , driving without a license increases the chances an illegal immigrant will be cited , and if arrested , come to the attention of immigration authorities , which could trigger deportation proceedings .<-->O
California has the largest undocumented population in the nation , at 2.45 million .<-->N
Until now , those driving without a license at the least faced steep fines and vehicle seizure .<-->N
Mr. Monroy said he paid $ 1,346 two years ago to get his impounded car back .<-->N
Blanca Gonzalez , behind him in line , said she was fined $ 500 when she was pulled over recently and couldn t produce a license .<-->F
Latin American , Asian and African immigrants were among the hundreds who flocked to the Culver City branch to take the DMV s written exam , which is offered in multiple languages , on touch-screen monitors .<-->N
Ms. Gonzalez , a Mexican mother of three , said she was nervous because she had had little time to study .<-->O
Mr. Monroy said he had paid $ 55 for a three-hour prep course offered by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles .<-->N
The DMV said that statewide 64 % of those who took the test in Spanish failed on Jan. 2 , the only day for which it released data .<-->F
Overall in California , about half of all first-time test takers fail the written exam , the agency said .<-->N
Spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez said the DMV has encouraged immigrants to study , after noting that a large share of applicants in Nevada failed in the first few weeks after licenses were offered there last year .<-->N
Between 9 % and 15 % of cars on the road in California lack insurance , according to independent estimates , boosting premiums for those insured .<-->N
Supporters of the licensing law are optimistic the uninsured pool will shrink .<-->O
Unlicensed drivers for years have been able to buy insurance from niche players that charge them higher premiums .<-->N
Under another new California law , low-income undocumented immigrants will be eligible for state-administered low-cost auto insurance .<-->O
The annual premium for the liability-only insurance is $ 339 in San Francisco and $ 472 in Los Angeles .<-->N
We re ramping up capacity , said Chris Shultz , deputy commissioner of the California Department of Insurance .<-->F
The agency has launched a marketing campaign in immigrant communities .<-->N
New applicant Mr. Monroy rejoiced at hearing he had passed the written test then immediately joined another queue to schedule a driving test .<-->N
Thank God , I passed , said the mechanic , some seven hours after he had arrived at the office .<-->N
Ban Home work 1 .<-->F
French President Proposes Banning Homework Talk about courting the youth vote .<-->N
French President Fran ois Hollande has proposed banning homework as part of a series of policies designed to reform the French educational system .<-->N
`` Education is priority , '' Hollande said in a speech at Paris 's Sorbonne University .<-->N
`` An education program is , by definition , a societal program .<-->N
Work should be done at school , rather than at home . ''<-->O
The justification for this proposed ban ?<-->N
According to a statement from an official at the French Embassy , `` When it comes to homework , the President said it should be done during school hours rather than at home , in order to establish equal opportunities . ''<-->O
Homework favors the wealthy , Hollande argues , because they are more likely to have a good working environment at home , including parents with the time and energy to help them with their work .<-->O
Hollande 's education proposal is not limited to a homework ban .<-->N
According to the embassy , Hollande has also pledged to add 60,000 teaching jobs in the next five years .<-->N
He has also expressed support for extending the school week by establishing a model in which children would attend school for nine half days a week .<-->O
Schools would be able to decide if this is spread over four , five or even six days , in consultation with local authorities and parents .<-->O
French children typically go to school for 36 weeks out of the year .<-->N
The school day is roughly as long as an American workday , lasting from 8:00 to 4:00 or later .<-->N
However , in most schools the week is only four days , with Wednesdays off in addition to Saturday and Sunday .<-->N
Hollande 's proposals are not official yet ; they 're part of an ongoing national debate about reforming the education system , which is , according to the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment , ranked 21st in reading , 22nd in math and 27th in science among countries in the OECD -LRB- Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation -RRB- .<-->N
The United States ranks 17th , 31st , and 23rd in those respective categories .<-->N
French president pushing homework ban as part of ed reforms How do you think this would go over in the United States ?<-->N
French President Fran ois Hollande has said he will end homework as part of a series of reforms to overhaul the country s education system .<-->N
And the reason he wants to ban homework ?<-->N
He doesn t think it is fair that some kids get help from their parents at home while children who come from disadvantaged families don t. It s an issue that goes well beyond France , and has been part of the reason that some Americans oppose homework too .<-->O
Hollande s reform plans include increasing the number of teachers , moving the school week from four days to 4 1/2 days , overhauling the curriculum and taking steps to cut down on absenteeism .<-->O
Education is priority , Hollande was quoted as saying by France24.com at Paris s Sorbonne University last week .<-->N
An education program is , by definition , a societal program .<-->N
Work should be done at school , rather than at home , as a way to ensure that students who have no help at home are not disadvantaged .<-->O
Despite the four-day school week , elementary school children in France spend more hours a year in school than many other developed countries because students are there all day , starting at 8:30 a.m. and ending at 4:30 p.m. , with some kids staying even later .<-->N
It s not clear where the money to hire thousands more teachers will come from , but , the Associated Press reported , Education Minister Vincent Peillon will have to figure out how to implement the reforms .<-->O
One option is to shorten summer vacation , though , such a move isn t likely to be popular because it is practically sacrosanct in France .<-->O
Whether Hollande really gets all of this done is open to question .<-->N
But his homework position is not original ; some school districts in the United States did the same thing going back more than a century .<-->O
Early in the 1900s , the influential Ladies Home Journal magazine called homework barbarous , and school districts such as Los Angeles abolished it in kindergarten through eighth grade .<-->O
In fact , some educators said it caused tuberculosis , nervous conditions and heart disease in the young and that children were better off playing outside .<-->O
The American Child Health Association in the 1930s labeled homework and child labor as leading killers of children who contracted tuberculosis and heart disease .<-->O
Today people who oppose homework have different objections , among them , the research that suggests it doesn t really help young children learn .<-->O
The end of homework ?<-->N
Why some schools are banning homework Sep. 8 , 2014 at 6:44 AM A. Pawlowski TODAY contributor Fed up with the tension over homework , some schools are opting out altogether .<-->N
No-homework policies are popping up all over , including schools in the U.S. , where the shift to the Common Core curriculum is prompting educators to rethink how students spend their time .<-->N
Homework really is a black hole , said Etta Kralovec , an associate professor of teacher education at the University of Arizona South and co-author of The End of Homework : How Homework Disrupts Families , Overburdens Children , and Limits Learning .<-->O
I think teachers are going to be increasingly interested in having total control over student learning during the class day and not relying on homework as any kind of activity that s going to support student learning .<-->O
College de Saint-Ambroise , an elementary school in Quebec , is the latest school to ban homework , announcing this week that it would try the new policy for a year .<-->N
The decision came after officials found that it was becoming more and more difficult for children to devote time to all the assignments they were bringing home , Marie - ve Desrosiers , a spokeswoman with the Jonqui re School Board , told the CBC .<-->N
Kralovec called the ban on homework a movement , though she estimated just a small handful of schools in the U.S. have such policies .<-->O
Gaithersburg Elementary School in Rockville , Maryland , is one of them , eliminating the traditional concept of homework in 2012 .<-->N
The policy is still in place and working fine , Principal Stephanie Brant told TODAY Parents .<-->N
The school simply asks that students read 30 minutes each night .<-->N
We felt like with the shift to the Common Core curriculum , and our knowledge of how our students need to think differently we wanted their time to be spent in meaningful ways , Brant said .<-->O
We re constantly asking parents for feedback and everyone s really happy with it so far .<-->O
But it s really a culture shift .<-->N
It was a decision that was best for her community , Brant said , adding that she often gets phone calls from other principals inquiring how it s working out .<-->N
The VanDamme Academy , a private K-8 school in Aliso Viejo , California , has a similar policy , calling homework largely pointless .<-->N
The Buffalo Academy of Scholars , a private school in Buffalo , New York , touts that it has called a truce in the homework battle and promises that families can enjoy stress-free , homework-free evenings and more quality time together at home .<-->N
Some schools have taken yet another approach .<-->N
At Ridgewood High School in Norridge , Illinois , teachers do assign homework but it doesn t count towards a student s final grade .<-->N
Many schools in the U.S. have toyed with the idea of opting out of homework , but end up changing nothing because it is such a contentious issue among parents , Kralovec noted .<-->O
There s a huge philosophical divide between parents who want their kids to be very scheduled , very driven , and very ambitiously focused at school -- those parents want their kids to do homework , she said .<-->O
And then there are the parents who want a more child-centered life with their kids , who want their kids to be able to explore different aspects of themselves , who think their kids should have free time .<-->O
So what s the right amount of time to spend on homework ?<-->N
National PTA spokeswoman Heidi May pointed to the organization s 10 minute rule , which recommends kids spend about 10 minutes on homework per night for every year they re in school .<-->N
That would mean 10 minutes for a first-grader and an hour for a child in the sixth grade .<-->O
But many parents say their kids must spend much longer on their assignments .<-->N
Last year , a New York dad tried to do his eight-grader s homework for a week and it took him at least three hours on most nights .<-->N
More than 80 percent of respondents in a TODAY.com poll complained kids have too much homework .<-->N
For homework critics like Kralovec , who said research shows homework has little value at the elementary and middle school level , the issue is simple .<-->O
Kids are at school 7 or 8 hours a day , that s a full working day and why should they have to take work home ?<-->N
she asked .<-->N
Ban homework Jennifer Nelson Published 4:00 am , Friday , July 20 , 2007 ONE OF the best things about summer -- for kids and parents alike -- is not worrying about homework .<-->O
Kids have the relief of not doing homework and parents have the relief of not having to pester their kids to get it done .<-->O
But at the Sixth Street Prep School in Victorville -LRB- San Bernardino County -RRB- , every day is homework free since the principal banned homework .<-->N
That 's right .<-->N
Principal Linda Mikels , with the support of her teaching staff , has eliminated homework for the students of her K-5 elementary school .<-->N
At the same time , the teachers agreed to extend the school day by 45 minutes to give them more time to `` coach '' their students .<-->N
According to Mikels , she was persuaded by academic research that suggested that , for elementary students , the assignment of regular homework does not result in any measurable improvement in their achievement .<-->N
In addition , she heard regular complaints from teachers and parents about the burden of daily homework .<-->O
In January 2006 , she decided to pitch the idea to her teachers of extending the school day and eliminating daily homework .<-->N
`` The teachers were absolutely ecstatic about the idea , '' Mikels said , adding that the students and parents had the same reaction when they were told about the idea .<-->O
Although they initially started with just the fourth and fifth grades , teachers in the lower grades soon asked to be included in the new program , which now includes all grades .<-->N
Students are not assigned daily homework , with the exception of extra reading time .<-->N
What was the result of banning homework ?<-->N
Happy students , happy parents and happy teachers .<-->O
Christina Soto is a teacher at Sixth Street Prep , as well as a parent .<-->N
Her son , Christian , will be a sixth-grader this fall and they are both big fans of the program .<-->O
Speaking from a parent 's perspective , Soto says , `` I absolutely love it .<-->O
There is no more arguing about getting homework done .<-->N
It 's already done .<-->N
That just helps us when he gets home .<-->N
We have more time for family time . ''<-->N
Christian likes having more help from his teacher , rather than his parents : `` Sometimes my parents do n't know what they are asking for , so having a teacher there -- asking my teacher for help -- is real helpful . ''<-->O
While the happiness factor is important , Mikels was thrilled when the school experienced its strongest growth in academic achievement ever after abandoning daily homework .<-->O
A century ago , California prohibited homework in the elementary grades .<-->N
But as concerns have been raised about U.S. workers ' ability to compete in an increasingly complex global economy , the American education system has responded by loading on the homework .<-->O
As a result , while grownups spend a lot of time talking about their work-life balance , our kids are more overworked than ever , with less time for extracurricular activities or family time .<-->N
Some experts argue that homework is nothing more than busywork .<-->N
Alfie Kohn , the author of `` The Homework Myth , '' contends that there is absolutely no correlation between homework and student academic achievement , particularly for younger students .<-->O
`` Over the last quarter-century , the burden has increased most for the youngest children , for whom the evidence of positive effects is n't just dubious ; it 's nonexistent , '' he wrote in an article for Principal magazine earlier this year .<-->O
Most parents will say that their children have much more homework than they did when they were in elementary school .<-->N
A friend admitted to me that he ca n't remember studying until high school .<-->N
These days , homework starts in kindergarten .<-->N
My son 's best friend , who will start kindergarten in the fall , is dreading school .<-->O
As the youngest of three kids , he has experienced first hand the stress and chaos homework can create in a family .<-->O
Mikels says one of the greatest benefits of the program is that the students start their day on a positive note .<-->O
Gone is the stress of collecting homework and disciplining students who had nothing to turn in .<-->N
In its place is extra time for the teachers to gauge if the student has grasped the concept they are teaching .<-->N
`` To view the teacher as coach and increasing the coaching time is much more valuable than sending work home without the coach there to help them , '' says Mikels .<-->O
`` The bottom line is that excellent instruction does n't really require hours of homework . ''<-->O
While we all want our children do be academically successful , there is value to children having time to play , read and socialize .<-->O
My guess is that if a measure banning homework were put to California 's voters , it would be overwhelmingly approved .<-->N
School boards across the state should look at Sixth Street Prep 's experience and consider changing their own homework requirements .<-->O
As Kohn says , `` Surely anyone who believes that homework is beneficial should be willing to test that assumption by investigating the consequences of its absence . ''<-->O
Should schools ban homework ?<-->F

She is the author of `` The End of Homework , '' `` Schools That Do Too Much '' and `` Identity in Metamorphosis . ''<-->N
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .<-->N
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With a new school year starting , homework is front and center in many homes .<-->N
Parents worry if their kids are completing the assigned work while kids wonder why they have to work when really they prefer to play in the sun .<-->O
There 's good news for some families in Quebec .<-->N
The College de Saint-Ambroise , an elementary school in Quebec , has banned homework for kids in grade one through six for a year .<-->F
The Canadian media exploded with blogs , tweets and radio talk shows questioning the decision or applauding the action .<-->F
Attempts to ban homework are n't new .<-->F
In 2012 , President Francoise Hollande of France proposed banning homework for all primary and middle school students , which was roundly ridiculed by The Wall Street Journal .<-->N
In the same year , a school in Germany decided to actually do away with homework for students in grades five to nine .<-->N
Oddly , when schools decide to ban homework , it is big news , but we know little about what happens afterward .<-->O
What we do know is that Finland assigns little homework and its students have some of the highest test scores in the world .<-->O
Los Angeles Unified School District -- America 's second-largest school system -- took a different tact .<-->N
In 2011 , it set a policy that homework could not count for more than 10 % of a student 's grade .<-->N
The decision caused such an outrage that a 15-member panel was formed and subsequently changed the policy so that homework accounted for 20 % of a student 's grade .<-->O
This kind of intense debate about homework has a long history .<-->O
For example , in the 1920s , some physicians were concerned about the impact of homework on children 's health .<-->N
They argued that children need between six to seven hours a day of fresh air and sunshine .<-->O
In the 1930s , editor Edward Bok of the Ladies Home Journal also called for an end to the practice .<-->N
For the rest of the 20th century , different research reports were used to support or dismiss the practice , yet it persists despite the lack of clarity on its educational value .<-->O
What is clear is that parents and kids do n't live in the world of academic research ; they live in the real world where there are piles of homework on the kitchen table .<-->O
The experience of homework is very different depending on which side of the economic divide you sit .<-->N
The unequal distribution of educational resources means that some students go home to nannies , well-stocked home libraries , tutors , well-educated parents and high-speed Internet .<-->O
Others students go home to caring for siblings in crowded apartments and often-absent parents who barely make ends meet .<-->N
The issue of inequality was a main reason that the French President proposed banning homework .<-->N
What about parents ' educational hopes for their kids ?<-->N
Homework forces families to follow the state 's educational agenda .<-->N
Most parents are willing to turn their kids over to the state for the seven to nine hours of the school day for educational enrichment .<-->O
But then they want to build a rich family life with their kids , and homework can interfere with that .<-->O
For example , if parents want their children to be actively engaged with grandparents or church activities in the evening , those things would compete with homework time .<-->N
Who controls a child 's time has tremendous implications for the debate on homework .<-->O
Should children be in school nine hours only to come home to two hours of homework ?<-->N
Could the intense pressure on children to achieve academically have negative health impacts down the road , in addition to the increased childhood obesity we are seeing ?<-->O
When schools ratchet up the pressure for higher academic achievement , one of the first things to go is recess even as homework is piled on .<-->O
While scholars debate the value of homework -- and pundits , politicians and educators call for increased educational choices , greater standardization and accountability for schools -- many parents and students feel overwhelmed .<-->O
The pressure of longer school days and more homework do n't help matters .<-->N
Parents who want to connect personally in meaningful ways with their children after a long day at their job would do well to remember that they have a right to family time uninterrupted by homework .<-->O
They would do well to listen to what their kids have to say about the impact of homework on their lives .<-->N
Too much homework may not be a good thing , especially for younger children .<-->O
For families interested in clearing the kitchen table they can find support and advice from the growing Healthy Homework movement .<-->O
At the end of the day , it 's about how one wants to balance work , family , educational goals and happiness .<-->N

Homework should be banned By Ben Robinson , 15 September 2013 1.54 pm .<-->N
Teaching unions have demanded homework for primary school pupils be scrapped amid claims they face a spiralling workload .<-->N
Parents say children as young as six are being set up to an hour s work a night .<-->N
With the new term under way , online message forums have been inundated with mums and dads expressing concern about the workload .<-->O
Now unions are calling for a ban on homework in primary schools .<-->N
However , opponents have branded their calls ridiculous and pointed to studies linking homework with higher achievement .<-->N
Ian Toone , of Voice The Union , said : Some of these primary schools might think by setting homework they will raise standards but my view is that it can be counter-productive .<-->O
I would say homework for primary school pupils should not be necessary .<-->O
Primary school children spend enough time in school as it is .<-->N
If they are given more work in the evening it is going to tire them out and they won t be able to do other things .<-->N
They should have time to relax .<-->N
In 2012 Education Secretary Michael Gove scrapped Government guidelines on how many hours of homework should be set by primary and secondary schools .<-->N
But Mr Toone claims the Government should now go further and scrap all homework for primary school pupils , claiming it causes unnecessary stress to youngsters and disproportionately favours pupils from more privileged backgrounds .<-->O
His calls come just days after a lobby of nearly 130 education experts called for children to start school as late as the age of seven , mirroring the Scandinavian systems said to be among the best in the world .<-->O
But Chris McGovern , of lobby group the Campaign for Real Education , claimed many youngsters relish their homework .<-->N
He said : I don t think it should be banned , that would be ridiculous , but it needs to be decided by individual schools .<-->O
When I was a head teacher in London where the children were aged five to 13 we had a relaxed approach to homework , which meant by year six or seven they were doing seven homeworks a week .<-->N
We thought it was sufficient .<-->N
I don t think we want to overburden children but there are children who are desperate to find out more and learn more .<-->O
There are plenty of children who like to do homework such as reading a book .<-->O
It is a pleasure to them .<-->N
Mr McGovern added state primary schools should look to the independent sector where school days are extended so that pupils do their homework before they leave school for the evening .<-->O
His views were echoed by Conservative MSP Liz Smith , a former teacher , who said it would be a mistake to abolish homework at primary schools .<-->O
She said : Homework is valuable in instilling self-discipline which helps their learning in the classroom .<-->O
It s a worthwhile tool even for the youngest children .<-->N
I certainly would never ban it .<-->N
It s a wonderful way of engaging with parents during those early years .<-->O
However , Professor Cary Cooper , a psychology expert at Lancaster University , warned teachers should be very careful about piling too much on youngsters .<-->O
He said : At primary school level we are not just developing learning abilities but social skills , getting on with other people and creative skills .<-->O
If homework is just solid reading , writing and arithmetic and not about creative skills like drawing a picture of the family , it could create difficulties .<-->O
Six-year-olds can not cope with that much .<-->N
It is the scale of it .<-->N
If it is too much too young and it is not broad enough , it could be problematic for some kids .<-->O
A spokesman for schools regulator Ofsted said : Ofsted is not concerned with how a school gets to outstanding as long as it gets there .<-->O
We are not prescriptive when it comes to homework .<-->N
Eileen Prior , executive director of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council , said homework divides parents .<-->N
She said many feel it gives them a chance to find out what their child is doing at school while others find it an unwelcome intrusion into children s free time .<-->O
In her view , most parents want to help but many feel unable to because of work , other commitments or because they don t feel confident to do so .<-->O
She said : We encourage parent groups in schools to work with their schools on ways to help parents build their confidence through , for instance , family learning events .<-->O
Kristina Woolnough , of the National Parent Forum Scotland , added : Children should enjoy their learning .<-->O
If they are struggling or unhappy , parents should speak to the school as soon as possible .<-->O
Homework is a key part of the partnership between home and school .<-->N
It needs to be discussed and supported by both partners to be effective in helping children to learn .<-->O
In 2012 a study by the Institute of Education , Oxford and Birkbeck College , linked homework with higher achievement .<-->N
The spokesman added the regulator s handbook does contain advice that homework should be appropriate .<-->O
A Department for Education spokesperson said : Homework is an important part of a good education .<-->N
Schools should develop their own homework policies in consultation with staff , pupils , parents and governors .<-->N
Will Homework Ban Ease Student Stress ?<-->N
Alarmed by indicators of student stress like cheating and substance abuse , a handful of San Francisco Bay Area schools are reducing an education staple : homework .<-->O
Oak Knoll Elementary in Menlo Park has mostly banned homework except reading , special projects or catch-up work .<-->N
Palo Alto 's Addison Elementary and the Berryessa School District in San Jose are discussing the issue .<-->N
For two decades teachers have been under pressure to raise academic standards and test scores , but CBS News correspondent John Blackstone reports that many are now questioning the value of burying students in homework .<-->N
The changes have come as a University of Missouri study found high school students benefit tremendously from homework .<-->O
In middle school , the results were not as strong , but homework was still found to be beneficial .<-->O
But on the elementary school level , the same study found homework had no effect on students .<-->N
The principal at Oak Knoll Elementary says first-graders spend about six hours a day doing school work , and they should n't have to do more work when they go home .<-->N
Not all homework at Oak Knoll has been eliminated for example , third-graders will still practice their multiplication tables at home .<-->N
Critics say homework steals time that increasingly busy children need to play or spend with family .<-->O
Homework proponents argue that it teaches students to be more responsible and manage their time .<-->N
At Duke University , Harris Cooper tells CBS News his research has shown that homework does help learning .<-->N
`` All students can benefit from homework , but the amount and type that is done at each age level should be different , '' Cooper says .<-->N
Fueled by parent complaints , the too-much-homework issue has taken root primarily in wealthy communities with high-achieving schools .<-->O
Struggling schools are still trying to involve parents in their children 's education .<-->N
Some schools are trying to find a balance .<-->N
Ohlone Elementary School in Palo Alto assigns homework to the parents .<-->N
Oak Knoll principal David Ackerman says the majority of parents have been supportive of the change .<-->N
He says other districts have contacted him and are now rethinking their homework policies .<-->N
Swedish town to ban homework ?<-->N
A proposal to ban homework in one central Swedish town is causing a fiery debate .<-->O
Members of the city council of Hallstahammar discussed the advantages of abolishing homework in schools at a meeting Monday , the British newspaper The Independent reported .<-->N
Members of a Left Party called V nsterpartiet contend teachers should teach all necessary lessons in the classroom , and not have to assign students extra work .<-->O
`` Students shouldn t have to take home their work and burden their parents with it , '' Christina Aspenryd , chairman of Hallstahammar 's children and education board , told Swedish news site , The Local .<-->N
`` When the students come home they should be free to do what they like , '' Aspenryd added .<-->O
Aspenryd pointed out that students would still have the option to do school work at home , but teachers would not assign homework .<-->O
Another issue is working parents who may not have time to assist kids at home .<-->N
`` We are aware that children have very different situations at home , '' Aspenryd explained .<-->N
`` Some parents are not able to help their children .<-->N
It s better that all children get help in the classroom . ''<-->O
Sweden has a reputation for its liberal approach to education but Education Minister Jan Bj rklund of the Liberal People s Party slammed the idea , saying homework should not be an issue for town councils to determine .<-->O
If this proposal is passed , I will take the initiative to change school laws so that cities will not be able to butt in and affect this kind of pedagogical decision , Bj rklund said according to The Local , citing Swedish wire service TT News .<-->O
Aspenryd said the proposal will be explored further this fall , to determine what resources would be necessary to make changes .<-->O
`` We might need to make the school day a bit longer , for instance , '' she said .<-->O
China Weighs Ban On Homework ; Teachers , Students Argue Against Chinese officials hope to rein in teachers who assign too much homework , as the country 's Ministry of Education considers new rules that ban schools from requiring students to complete written tasks at home .<-->O
Citing undue stress on students , the ministry would also limit the number of exams students take .<-->O
The goal of relieving pressure on students was also cited in July , when China 's Education agency issued a ban on written homework for first and second graders during the summer vacation .<-->N
Readers may recall that last autumn , French President Francois Hollande declared his wish to ban homework , as well .<-->N
Chinese officials presented a draft version of a long-term education reform plan for public comment last week .<-->N
The plan calls for cutting homework , replacing it with visits to museums and libraries , and boosting `` students ' hands-on capabilities through handicrafts or farm work , '' the Xinhua state news agency reports .<-->N
The plan 's goals include `` raising the senior high school gross enrollment rate to 90 percent , and increasing the higher education gross enrollment rate to 40 percent , '' according to a press bulletin at the ministry 's website .<-->O
One rule would prohibit any unified exams for students in the third grade and younger .<-->N
Students in the fourth grade and above could not be required to take more than two exams per subject in each semester .<-->N
The plan would also require that `` exam scores and contest awards shall not be used as criteria for school admission in the compulsory education phase . ''<-->O
Another proposal targets extracurricular academic classes , which many Chinese parents rely on to help their kids get ahead .<-->N
`` Parents of one Shanghai second-grader said they have this year spent nearly 30,000 yuan -LRB- US$ 4,901 -RRB- on extra classes such as English and mathematics , '' reports the SINA news site .<-->N
In the fight over homework , it seems the teachers may have an unlikely ally : their students .<-->O
`` It 's not that much work , '' one girl tells The Shanghaiist , in a video that some of her classmates probably hope goes unseen .<-->N
`` Sometimes it takes just half an hour to 40 minutes . ''<-->N
`` It takes just 40 minutes to do the homework , '' another girl says .<-->N
`` If there 's more from my mom , then it takes me just a little over an hour . ''<-->O
That 's right Chinese parents sometimes assign homework of their own .<-->N
As another student explains , his parents require him to complete exercises that are separate from his school studies .<-->N
`` My parents just bought me some workbooks , '' he says .<-->N
`` They just want me to learn better and get into a good junior high school . ''<-->O
The push to cut homework has also met with resistance among educators , who say it would undermine their efforts to have students retain what they learn .<-->O
And teachers tell SINA that for issues like literacy , homework is crucial .<-->N
Others say homework is n't the real problem .<-->N
`` If homework or academic assignments are stopped , schools and parents will worry about the possible decline in enrollment rates , which remains the main assessment of education quality , '' elementary education director Wang Ming , of the National Education Development Research Center , tells China Daily .<-->O
`` If we want to have a real impact on easing the burden , the assessment and enrollment systems , which still heavily count on examination results , should be adjusted , '' he says .<-->O
In June , Xinhua reported four recent instances of Chinese students killing themselves after they received poor scores on college entrance exams .<-->N
And The Shanghaiist reports that in 2011 , three young girls `` allegedly killed themselves over stress related to school work . ''<-->N
The site also notes that China 's education officials have been urging cuts to homework burdens since 1988 , with few positive results .<-->N
All Homework Should Be Banned My phone lines lit up like a Christmas tree .<-->N
As the host of a three-hour mid-morning talk show on CJAD radio in Montreal , I am used to dealing with topics that spark an animated reaction .<-->O
However , I was not prepared this morning for the deluge of emotion when I suggested that all homework should be banned .<-->O
My proposal was simple enough : No more homework , not elementary school and not in high school .<-->O
Keep in mind that I am not talking about reading at home or working on a special project .<-->N
That would be fine .<-->N
I am talking about assignments that have to be done at home and handed in to a flustered teacher who hands them back days later when the material is long forgotten .<-->N
Does n't homework help students get better marks ?<-->O
One study after another , including the latest one from the Australian Institute of Family Studies , is proof that it does nothing of the kind .<-->N
Not only is homework unhelpful , it 's harmful .<-->N
For 30 minutes , one call after another proved that the idea of a ban struck a chord with parents .<-->N
One mother of a 7-year-old girl was practically in tears when she told me her daughter , who used to love school , now hates it .<-->N
Because she is forced to do 90 minutes of homework assignments every day !<-->N
No wonder she hates school .<-->N
She is seven , for heaven 's sake .<-->N
The child gets up at 7:30 in the morning .<-->N
She 's in school all day long .<-->N
The bus picks her up at 3:45 to take her home .<-->N
By the time she is dropped off , it 's nearly 5:00 .<-->N
That day is long enough .<-->N
She should not be forced to work for another hour and a half .<-->N
Give her time to be a child , to spend quality time with her family , to have fun with her mom without arguing day in and day out .<-->N
If she knows the work , there is no need to do more of it .<-->N
If she does not understand , there 's no point in having her repeat her mistakes Shocked at the prospect of doing away with something that is such a staple of virtually every school system across the continent , another parent called me to protest .<-->O
She said , `` What are you talking about ?<-->N
I mean ... we have to have homework .<-->N
Otherwise , the kids wo n't have structure and they will just come home and fool around . ''<-->O
That 's exactly what they should be doing .<-->N
They deal with structure from early in the morning until late in the afternoon .<-->N
That 's enough structure for an adult , much less a child .<-->O
It 's time to ` fess up about homework .<-->N
It is forced labor .<-->F
Unpaid forced labor .<-->N
Homework assignments provide precious little benefit and they cause unnecessary stress for the child and for the parent .<-->O
Good teachers can get the job done in class .<-->N
Those who ca n't just assign more homework .<-->N
Some schools are finally pondering the possibility of eliminating weekend or holiday homework assignments .<-->N
That 's too namby-pamby .<-->N
Not good enough .<-->N
It 's time to stop the addiction to homework cold turkey .<-->N
If a student wishes to review some of the work of the day on their own , great .<-->O
If the kids have to study for a test or exam -- no problem .<-->N
But those millions of hours of useless make-work homework assignments ?<-->N
They have caused misery enough .<-->N
Homework is cruel and unusual punishment .<-->N
Banning it will improve the life of students , parents and teachers in one fell swoop .<-->O
Reading at home or perhaps playing a musical instrument connected with school work , that 's fine , but the homework assignments have got to go .<-->N
What will these kids do with all their new-found spare time ?<-->N
They will relax ; they can have some fun ; they can play outside ; and spend time with their friends .<-->O
Letting kids be kids -- what a novel concept .<-->N
After hearing what parents were telling me , I want to help them get rid of homework .<-->O
We will start with Montreal .<-->N
If -- make that when -- we succeed , perhaps we will set the example for the rest of North America .<-->O
If you agree , tell your friends and neighbors .<-->N
If you do n't agree , you better get back to the kitchen table .<-->O
The homework is waiting .<-->N
Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed ?<-->N
1,188 people were executed in the US from 1977 through 2009 , primarily by means of lethal injection .<-->N
Most death penalty cases involve the execution of murderers although capital punishment can also be applied for treason , espionage , and other crimes .<-->O
Proponents of the death penalty say it is an important tool for preserving law and order , deters crime , and costs less than life imprisonment .<-->O
They argue that retribution or `` an eye for an eye '' honors the victim , helps console grieving families , and ensures that the perpetrators of heinous crimes never have an opportunity to cause future tragedy .<-->O
Opponents of capital punishment say it has no deterrent effect on crime , wrongly gives governments the power to take human life , and perpetuates social injustices by disproportionately targeting people of color -LRB- racist -RRB- and people who can not afford good attorneys -LRB- classist -RRB- .<-->O
They say lifetime jail sentences are a more severe and less expensive punishment than death .<-->O
PRO Death Penalty CON Death Penalty 1 .<-->N
Morality PRO : `` The crimes of rape , torture , treason , kidnapping , murder , larceny , and perjury pivot on a moral code that escapes apodictic -LSB- indisputably true -RSB- proof by expert testimony or otherwise .<-->O
But communities would plunge into anarchy if they could not act on moral assumptions less certain than that the sun will rise in the east and set in the west .<-->O
Abolitionists may contend that the death penalty is inherently immoral because governments should never take human life , no matter what the provocation .<-->O
But that is an article of faith , not of fact .<-->O
The death penalty honors human dignity by treating the defendant as a free moral actor able to control his own destiny for good or for ill ; it does not treat him as an animal with no moral sense . ''<-->O
Bruce Fein , JD Constitutional Lawyer and General Counsel to the Center for Law and Accountability `` Individual Rights and Responsibility - The Death Penalty , But Sparingly , '' www.aba.org June 17 , 2008 CON : `` Ultimately , the moral question surrounding capital punishment in America has less to do with whether those convicted of violent crime deserve to die than with whether state and federal governments deserve to kill those whom it has imprisoned .<-->O
The legacy of racial apartheid , racial bias , and ethnic discrimination is unavoidably evident in the administration of capital punishment in America .<-->O
Death sentences are imposed in a criminal justice system that treats you better if you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent .<-->O
This is an immoral condition that makes rejecting the death penalty on moral grounds not only defensible but necessary for those who refuse to accept unequal or unjust administration of punishment . ''<-->O

Constitutionality PRO : `` Simply because an execution method may result in pain , either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death , does not establish the sort of ` objectively intolerable risk of harm ' -LSB- quoting the opinion of the Court from Farmer v.

Kentucky 's decision to adhere to its protocol can not be viewed as probative of the wanton infliction of pain under the Eighth Amendment ... Throughout our history , whenever a method of execution has been challenged in this Court as cruel and unusual , the Court has rejected the challenge .<-->O
Our society has nonetheless steadily moved to more humane methods of carrying out capital punishment . ''<-->N

Roberts Apr. 16 , 2008 CON : `` Death is ... an unusually severe punishment , unusual in its pain , in its finality , and in its enormity ...

Deterrence PRO : `` Common sense , lately bolstered by statistics , tells us that the death penalty will deter murder ... People fear nothing more than death .<-->O
Therefore , nothing will deter a criminal more than the fear of death ... life in prison is less feared .<-->O
Murderers clearly prefer it to execution -- otherwise , they would not try to be sentenced to life in prison instead of death ... Therefore , a life sentence must be less deterrent than a death sentence .<-->O
And we must execute murderers as long as it is merely possible that their execution protects citizens from future murder . ''<-->O
Ernest Van Den Haag , PhD Late Professor of Jurisprudence at Fordham University `` For the Death Penalty , '' New York Times Oct. 17 , 1983 CON : '' -LSB- T -RSB- here is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than long terms of imprisonment .<-->O

Retribution PRO : `` Society is justly ordered when each person receives what is due to him .<-->N
Crime disturbs this just order , for the criminal takes from people their lives , peace , liberties , and worldly goods in order to give himself undeserved benefits .<-->O
Deserved punishment protects society morally by restoring this just order , making the wrongdoer pay a price equivalent to the harm he has done .<-->O
This is retribution , not to be confused with revenge , which is guided by a different motive .<-->O
In retribution the spur is the virtue of indignation , which answers injury with injury for public good ... Retribution is the primary purpose of just punishment as such ... -LSB- R -RSB- ehabilitation , protection , and deterrence have a lesser status in punishment than retribution . ''<-->O
J. Budziszewski , PhD Professor of Government and Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin `` Capital Punishment : The Case for Justice , '' OrthodoxyToday.org Aug. / Sep. 2004 CON : `` Retribution is just another word for revenge , and the desire for revenge is one of the lowest human emotions perhaps sometimes understandable , but not really a rational response to a critical situation .<-->O
To kill the person who has killed someone close to you is simply to continue the cycle of violence which ultimately destroys the avenger as well as the offender .<-->O
That this execution somehow give ` closure ' to a tragedy is a myth .<-->N
Expressing one s violence simply reinforces the desire to express it .<-->N
Just as expressing anger simply makes us more angry .<-->O
It does not drain away .<-->N
It contaminates the otherwise good will which any human being needs to progress in love and understanding . ''<-->O

Mistakes will be made in any system which relies upon human testimony for proof .<-->N
We should be vigilant to uncover and avoid such mistakes .<-->O
Our system of justice rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases .<-->O
However , the risk of making a mistake with the extraordinary due process applied in death penalty cases is very small , and there is no credible evidence to show that any innocent persons have been executed at least since the death penalty was reactivated in 1976 ...

In short , while others , like Governor Ryan in Illinois , have recognized the flaws in the death penalty , the Congress still just does n't get it .<-->O
This system is broken . ''<-->N

Physicians at Executions PRO : `` Accepting capital punishment in principle means accepting it in practice , whether by the hand of a physician or anyone else ... If one finds the practice too brutal , one must either reject it in principle or seek to mitigate its brutality .<-->O
If one chooses the latter option , then the participation of physicians seems more humane than delegating the deed to prison wardens , for by condoning the participation of untrained people who could inflict needless suffering that we physicians might have prevented , we are just as responsible as if we had inflicted the suffering ourselves .<-->O
The AMA -LSB- American Medical Association -RSB- position should be changed either to permit physician participation or to advocate the abolition of capital punishment .<-->O
The hypocritical attitude of ` My hands are clean let the spectacle proceed ' only leads to needless human suffering . ''<-->O
Bruce E. Ellerin , MD , JD Doctor of Oncology Radiation at Sierra Providence Health Network Response letter to the New England Journal of Medicine regarding an article titled `` When Law and Ethics Collide Why Physicians Participate in Executions , '' by Atul Gawande , MD July 6 , 2006 CON : `` The American Medical Association 's policy is clear and unambiguous ... requiring physicians to participate in executions violates their oath to protect lives and erodes public confidence in the medical profession .<-->O
A physician is a member of a profession dedicated to preserving life ... The use of a physician 's clinical skill and judgment for purposes other than promoting an individual 's health and welfare undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine first , do no harm .<-->O
The guidelines in the AMA Code of Medical Ethics address physician participation in executions involving lethal injection .<-->N
The ethical opinion explicitly prohibits selecting injection sites for executions by lethal injection , starting intravenous lines , prescribing , administering , or supervising the use of lethal drugs , monitoring vital signs , on site or remotely , and declaring death . ''<-->O
American Medical Association -LRB- AMA -RRB- `` AMA : Physician Participation in Lethal Injection Violates Medical Ethics , '' press release from the AMA website July 17 , 2006 PRO Death Penalty CON Death Penalty ----------------- Should Death Penalty be Allowed ?<-->N
As of January 1998 , amongst the 50 states in the USA , 38 states and the federal government have implemented death penalty laws .<-->N
Capital punishment , as it is legally called , is a lawfully imposed death as a punishment for crime .<-->O
Many countries in the world have provisions for a capital punishment in their legal system , while quite a few do not .<-->N
Consequently , the debate on whether this form of punishment must be allowed or not is an extremely complicated issue .<-->O
Moreover , it has created a sort of divide between countries and across cultures .<-->N
In this following Buzzle article , we will deal with the important issues regarding this subject .<-->O
Death Penalty?The Why and Why Not Some of the countries that are in favor of capital punishments are of the mindset that capital punishment is important to set an example for criminals .<-->O
Jeremy Bentham , an English jurist , philosopher , and legal and social reformer opined with regards to capital punishment in these words '' The punishment suffered by the offender presents to every one an example of what he himself will have to suffer if he is guilty of the same offense . ''<-->O
Another reason for backing a death penalty is that those who hurt or bring harm to others have to be punished .<-->O
In some cases , it is also a kind of retribution by those who take care of law and order on behalf of the victims .<-->N
Interestingly , the number of reasons why capital punishment should not be implemented outnumber the former .<-->N
The argument starts from the fact that killing a human being is unethical .<-->O
Another opinion is that capital punishment is not used with discretion , especially against the poor and racial , religious and ethnic minorities .<-->O
Further , if the criminal turns over a new leaf through rehabilitation , it could be good for the society .<-->O
If , God forbid , an innocent person is given the death penalty , it can be immensely tragic .<-->O
Finally , the Roman Catholic Church has touted it as not being ` pro life ' .<-->N
These are the arguments that are in connection with ` should capital punishment be allowed ' .<-->N
Judicial Decision Against Death Penalty One of the most known cases dealing with capital punishment is the Furman vs. Georgia , 408 US 153 -LRB- 1972 -RRB- .<-->N
This case was a path breaking example of one where the Supreme Court slashed the federal and state capital punishment laws , rendering them as capricious and arbitrary .<-->O
Ultimately , as a result of this judgment , around 600 prisoners who were given the death sentence had their sentence lifted .<-->N
Later , in the USA , the Supreme Court upheld new death penalty laws .<-->O
Even in this case , the judgment was given not because the penalty was considered unconstitutional , but because there were some glitches in the laws aiding the implementation of the penalty .<-->O
This judgment gave a new facet to the debate of should capital punishment be illegal .<-->O
With both facets of the issue being put forth in form of debates and arguments , there is yet no consensus on whether death penalty should be allowed or banned .<-->O
We leave you with this quote that aptly portrays what we need to say .<-->O
`` Justice will only be achieved when those who are not injured by crime feel as indignant as those who are . ''<-->O
~ King Solomon .<-->N
Read more at Buzzle : http://www.buzzle.com/articles/should-death-penalty-be-allowed.html ---------------- The Death Penalty Should Not Be Abolished With James Holmes ' impending sentencing , and Dzhokar Tsarnaev 's trial coming up , there has been a renewed interest in the capital punishment debate .<-->O
With so much opposition , it is important to look at the points of contention and understand why we should not get rid of the death penalty .<-->O
Many of the arguments used against the death penalty are fundamentally flawed ; for example , some people who oppose the death penalty cite religious reasons for abolishing it .<-->O
Regardless of the argument , religion has absolutely no place in our government or legal system .<-->N
We are a country founded on the separation of church and state , and despite how murky the waters are in a lot of areas concerning religion and law , we should be doing everything in our power to keep religion and religious ideals out of government if we expect to continue being a country with religious freedom and tolerance .<-->O
Then there is the argument that despite the lengthy and complex judicial process for seeking the death penalty , it is still not possible to guarantee that an innocent person will not be sentenced .<-->O
That might be true , but there are extensive appeals processes in place for exactly that reason .<-->O
It is also argued that the appeals process is a strain on taxpayers , costing more than just sentencing them to life without the possibility of parole , as well as a strain on the court system .<-->O
However , death penalty cases account for only 1 % of appellate court caseloads in both courts of last resort and intermediate appellate courts , so they are clearly not that great of a strain on the courts , nor on taxpayers .<-->O
While the death penalty should be maintained , it is important that stipulations be made on how it is implemented .<-->O
Many people wonder if victims and their families should have any say in whether or not prosecutors seek the death penalty .<-->O
In the Holmes case , Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler personally talked to 60 family members of the Aurora victims and his office as a whole reached out to about 800 relatives of the victims in order to help them make this decision .<-->N
It is my personal opinion that victims and those related to victims in any way should not have a say , because then you are dealing with vengeance , not justice .<-->O
Once that line is crossed , it is not fair to say that someone should be put to death because it is not decided by an unbiased , unrelated third party .<-->O
A related issue is whether or not the lawyers themselves should have a say .<-->N
Tsarnaev 's attorney is a well-known advocate against the death penalty .<-->O
It is now rumored that due to recent negotiations , the death penalty may not be sought in exchange for more information surrounding the bombings .<-->N
Attorneys should not be allowed a say in whether the death penalty is sought or not either , because while negotiations may happen in any case , it is not fair that one person who commits a heinous crime would not have the death penalty considered because his attorney is personally opposed to it , while other people will have the death penalty considered because their attorneys are doing their jobs and being unbiased in their work .<-->O
Involving either the attorney or a victim 's family in the death penalty decision both also completely undermine the judicial system and the processes put in place for settling matters such as these .<-->O
When push comes to shove , capital punishment is a touchy subject and there are many factors that work together when figuring out if it is right or not .<-->O
It seems that in the end , however , it is the only fair way to deal with certain criminals past the point of moral reason .<-->O
It is truly the only way to show that in this country , murder and terrorism will not be tolerated .<-->O
-------------- Capital Punishment -LRB- the death penalty -RRB- Essay .<-->N
Should be allowed or not ?<-->N
Topic : Without capital punishment -LRB- the death penalty -RRB- our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase .<-->O
Capital punishment in essential to control violence in society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion ?<-->O
To execute some of criminals will not make our lives more secure than before .<-->N
People are facing a number of crimes such as robbery and assault on the streets which are putting our lives into more risks .<-->N
Since it started to be debated by the lawmakers whether it is essential or not , capital punishment has ben removed from a large number of countries ' criminal codes in the last few decades .<-->O
United Nation takes the main role in Europe .<-->N
However , some countries such as Iran , China and a part of United States stil put capital punishment into practise .<-->N
In my opinion , there is no benefit of keeping death penalty as a punishment for people who is harmed .<-->O
As dying is one of the most common fears of people , it can be claimed that death penalty can be considered as an exemplery for the individuals who cause crimes of violence in the society .<-->O
However , I believe that people who have potential to cause such a big crime of violence that will en up with a death penalty will not be capable of directing their emotions and behaviours in the right way to make the right decisions unless they recieve psychotherapy or any other help .<-->O
Furthermore , there had not been a considerable decrease in the amount of crime of violence while death penalty was put into practise .<-->O
One the other hand , it can be argued that governments are doing these criminals a favor by putting them into jails and providing food and place to live instead of executing .<-->O
They also say that the economy of the nations are effected in the negative way .<-->N
Nowadays , most nations ' governemtns are complaining about the crowd of criminals and having difficulties to provide place for more .<-->O
However , supporting to execute some criminals in order to make room for more does not include a rational point of view .<-->O
Putting criminals into jails is already an effective way to punish them .<-->N
Depending on the ` severity ' -LRB- not sure this is the right word -RRB- of the crime , they might be sentenced to live there for the rest of their lives .<-->O
Not supporting capital punishment does mean to protect the criminals .<-->O
Moreover executing them wwill not make our lives more secure .<-->N
Our lives will still be secure as long as they are not in social life untill they are aware what they have done wrong .<-->O
Sometimes it not even enough .<-->N
------------------- Ten Reasons To Oppose the Death Penalty Over 1,000 state prisoners are on death row in America today .<-->N
A Justice Department official recently said that many of them are exhausting their appeals and that we may soon `` witness executions at a rate approaching the more than three per week that prevailed during the 1930 's . ''<-->N
On Capitol Hill , meanwhile , there is an effort to restore the death penalty as a punishment for certain Federal crimes .<-->O
A bill to accomplish this was approved by the Judiciary Committee in a 13-to-6 vote last year when conservatives lined up for the death penalty and liberals declaimed in vain against it .<-->O
Yet one need not be a certified liberal in order to oppose the death penalty .<-->O
Richard Viguerie , premier fundraiser of the New Right , is a firm opponent of capital punishment .<-->O
Some of the arguments against the death penalty are essentially conservative , and many others transcend ideology .<-->O
No one has to agree with all of the arguments in order to reach a decision .<-->N
As President Reagan has said in another context , doubt should always be resolved on the side of life .<-->O
Nor need one be `` soft on crime '' in order to oppose the death penalty .<-->O
Albert Camus , an opponent of capital punishment , said : `` We know enough to say that this or that major criminal deserves hard labor for life .<-->O
But we do n't know enough to decree that he be shorn of his future in other words , of the chance we all have of making amends . ''<-->N
But many liberals in our country , by their naive ideas about quick rehabilitation and by their support for judicial discretion in sentencing , have done much to create demand for the death penalty they abhor .<-->O
People are right to be alarmed when judges give light sentences for murder and other violent crimes .<-->O
It is reasonable for them to ask : `` Suppose some crazy judge lets him out , and members of my family are his next victims ? ''<-->N
The inconsistency of the judicial system leads many to support the death penalty .<-->O
There are signs that some liberals now understand the problem .<-->N
Senators Patrick Leahy -LRB- D. , Vt. -RRB- and Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , in opposing the death-penalty bill approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee , are suggesting as an alternative `` a real life sentence '' for murder and `` heinous crimes . ''<-->O
By this they mean a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole .<-->O
And if we adopt Chief Justice Warren Burger 's proposal about making prisons into `` factories with fences , '' perhaps murderers can pay for their prison room and board and also make financial restitution to families they have deprived of breadwinners .<-->O
With these alternatives in mind , let us consider 10 good reasons to oppose the death penalty .<-->O
There is no way to remedy the occasional mistake .<-->N
One of the witnesses against the death penalty before the Senate committee last year was Earl Charles , a man who spent over three years on a Georgia death row for murders he did not commit .<-->O
Another witness remarked that , had Mr. Charles faced a system `` where the legal apparatus was speedier and the death penalty had been carried out more expeditiously , we would now be talking about the late Mr. Charles and bemoaning our error . ''<-->O
What happens when the mistake is discovered after a man has been executed for a crime he did not commit ?<-->N
What do we say to his widow and children ?<-->N
Do we erect an apologetic tombstone over his grave ?<-->N
These are not idle questions .<-->N
A number of persons executed in the United States were later cleared by confessions of those who had actually committed the crimes .<-->O
In other cases , while no one else confessed , there was great doubt that the condemned were guilty .<-->O
Watt Espy , an Alabamian who has done intensive research on American executions , says that he has `` every reason to believe '' that 10 innocent men were executed in Alabama alone .<-->O
Mr. Espy cites names , dates and other specifics of the cases .<-->N
He adds that there are similar cases in virtually every state .<-->N
We might consider Charles Peguy 's words about the turn-of-the-century French case in which Capt. Alfred Dreyfus was wrongly convicted of treason : `` We said that a single injustice , a single crime , a single illegality , particularly if it is officially recorded , confirmed ... that a single crime shatters and is sufficient to shatter the whole social pact , the whole social contract , that a single legal crime , a single dishonorable act will bring about the loss of one 's honor , the dishonor of a whole people . ''<-->O
There is racial and economic discrimination in application of the death penalty .<-->O
This is an old complaint , but one that many believe has been remedied by court-mandated safeguards .<-->O
All five of the prisoners executed since 1977 one shot , one gassed and three electrocuted were white .<-->N
This looks like a morbid kind of affirmative action plan , making up for past discrimination against blacks .<-->O
But the five were not representative of the death-row population , except in being male .<-->N
About 99 percent of the death-row inmates are men .<-->N
Of the 1,058 prisoners on death row by Aug. 20,1982 , 42 percent were black , whereas about 12 percent of the United States population is black .<-->O
Those who receive the death penalty still tend to be poor , poorly educated and represented by public defenders or court-appointed lawyers .<-->O
They are not the wealthy murderers of Perry Mason or Agatha Christie fame .<-->N
Discriminatory application of the death penalty , besides being unjust to the condemned , suggests that some victims ' lives are worth more than others .<-->O
A study published in Crime & Delinquency -LRB- October 1980 -RRB- found that , of black persons in Florida who commit murder , `` those who kill whites are nearly 40 times more likely to be sentenced to death than those who kill blacks . ''<-->O
Even Walter Berns , an articulate proponent of the death penalty , told the Senate Judiciary Committee last year that capital punishment `` has traditionally been imposed in this country in a grossly discriminatory fashion '' and said that `` it remains to be seen whether this country can impose the death penalty without regard to race or class . ''<-->O
If it can not , he declared , then capital punishment `` will have to be invalidated on equal-protection grounds . ''<-->N
It is quite possible to be for the death penalty in theory -LRB- `` If this were a just world , I 'd be for it '' -RRB- , but against it in practice -LRB- `` It 's an unjust , crazy , mixed-up world , so I 'm against it '' -RRB- .<-->O
Application of the death penalty tends to be arbitrary and capricious ; for similar crimes , some are sentenced to death while others are not .<-->O
Initially two men were charged with the killing for which John Spenkelink was electrocuted in Florida in 1979 .<-->N
The second man turned state 's evidence and was freed ; he remarked : `` I did n't intend for John to take the rap .<-->N
It just worked out that way . ''<-->N
Soon after the Spenkelink execution , former San Francisco official Dan White received a prison sentence of seven years and eight months in prison for killing two people the Mayor of San Francisco and another city official .<-->N
Anyone who follows the news can point to similar disparities .<-->N
Would the outcome be much different if we decided for life or death by rolling dice or spinning a roulette wheel ?<-->N
The death penalty gives some of the worst offenders publicity that they do not deserve .<-->O
Gary Gilmore and Steven Judy received reams of publicity as they neared their dates with the grim reaper .<-->N
They had a chance to expound before a national audience their ideas about crime and punishment , God and country , and anything else that happened to cross their minds .<-->O
It is hard to imagine two men less deserving of a wide audience .<-->O
It can be argued , of course , that if executions become as widespread and frequent as proponents of the death penalty hope , the publicity for each murderer will decline .<-->O
That may be so , but each may still be a media celebrity on a statewide basis .<-->O
While the death penalty undoubtedly deters some would-be murderers , there is evidence that it encourages others especially the unstable who are attracted to media immortality like moths to a flame .<-->O
If instead of facing heady weeks before television cameras , they faced a lifetime of obscurity in prison , the path of violence might seem less glamorous to them .<-->O
The death penalty involves medical doctors , who are sworn to preserve life , in the act of killing .<-->O
This issue has been much discussed in recent years because several states have provided for execution by lethal injection .<-->N
In 1980 the American Medical Association , responding to this innovation , declared that a doctor should not participate in an execution .<-->N
But it added that a doctor may determine or certify death in any situation .<-->N
The A.M.A. evaded a major part of the ethical problem .<-->O
When doctors use their stethoscopes to indicate whether the electric chair has done its job , they are assisting the executioner .<-->N
Executions have a corrupting effect on the public .<-->N
Thomas Macaulay said of the Puritans that they `` hated bear-baiting , not because it gave pain to the bear , but because it gave pleasure to the spectators . ''<-->O
While wrong on the first point , they were right on the second .<-->O
There is something indecent in the rituals that surround executions and the excitement even the entertainment that they provide to the public .<-->O
There is the cat-and-mouse ritual of the appeals process , with prisoners sometimes led right up to the execution chamber and then given a stay of execution .<-->N
There are the last visits from family , the last dinner , the last walk , the last words .<-->N
Television cameras , which have fought their way into courtrooms and nearly everywhere else , may some day push their way right up to the execution chamber and give us all , in living color , the very last moments .<-->O
The death penalty can not be limited to the worst cases .<-->O
Many people who oppose capital punishment have second thoughts whenever a particularly brutal murder occurs .<-->O
When a Richard Speck or Charles Manson or Steven Judy emerges , there is a tendency to say , `` That one really deserves to die . ''<-->N
Disgust , anger and genuine fear support the second thoughts .<-->O
But it is impossible to write a death penalty law in such a way that it will apply only to the Specks and Mansons and Judys of this world .<-->O
And , given the ingenuity of the best lawyers money can buy , there is probably no way to apply it to the worst murderers who happen to be wealthy .<-->O
The death penalty , like every other form of violence , is extremely difficult to limit once the `` hard cases '' persuade society to let down the bars in order to solve a few specific problems .<-->O
A sentence intended for Charles Manson is passed instead on J.D. Gleaton , a semiliterate on South Carolina 's death row who had difficulty understanding his trial .<-->O
Later he said : `` I do n't know anything about the law that much and when they are up there speaking those big words , I do n't even know what they are saying . ''<-->O
Or Thomas Hays , under sentence of death in Oklahoma and described by a fellow inmate as `` nutty as a fruit cake . ''<-->N
Before his crime , Mr. Hays was committed to mental hospitals several times ; afterwards , he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic .<-->N
The death penalty is an expression of the absolute power of the state ; abolition of that penalty is a much - needed limit on government power .<-->O
What makes the state so pure that it has the right to take life ?<-->O
Look at the record of governments throughout history so often operating with deception , cruelty and greed , so often becoming masters of the citizens they are supposed to serve .<-->O
`` Forbidding a man 's execution , '' Camus said , `` would amount to proclaiming publicly that society and the state are not absolute values . ''<-->O
It would amount to saying that there are some things even the state may not do .<-->N
There is also the problem of the state 's involving innocent people in a premeditated killing .<-->O
`` I 'm personally opposed to killing and violence , '' said the prison warden who had to arrange Gary Gilmore 's execution , `` and having to do that is a difficult responsibility . ''<-->O
Too often , in killing and violence , the state compels people to act against their consciences .<-->N
And there is the point that government should not give bad example especially not to children .<-->O
Earl Charles , a veteran of several years on death row for crimes he did not commit , tried to explain this last year : `` Well , it is difficult for me to sit down and talk to my son about ` thou shalt not kill , ' when the state itself ... is saying , ` Well , yes , we can kill , under certain circumstances . ' ''<-->O
With great understatement , Mr. Charles added , `` That is difficult .<-->N
I mean , that is confusing to him . ''<-->O
There are strong religious reasons for many to oppose the death penalty .<-->O
Some find compelling the thought that Cain , the first murderer , was not executed but was marked with a special sign and made a wanderer upon the face of the earth .<-->O
Richard Viguerie developed his position on capital punishment by asking what Christ would say and do about it .<-->N
`` I believe that a strong case can be made , '' Mr. Viguerie wrote in a recent book , `` that Christ would oppose the killing of a human being as punishment for a crime . ''<-->O
This view is supported by the New Testament story about the woman who faced execution by stoning -LRB- John 8:7 , `` He that is without sin among you , let him cast the first stone '' -RRB- .<-->O
Former Senator Harold Hughes -LRB- D. , Iowa -RRB- , arguing against the death penalty in 1974 , declared : '' ` Thou shalt not kill ' is the shortest of the Ten Commandments , uncomplicated by qualification or exception ... It is as clear and awesomely commanding as the powerful thrust of chain lightning out of a dark summer sky . ''<-->O
Even the guilty have a right to life .<-->O
Leszek Syski is a Maryland antiabortion activist who says that he `` became convinced that the question of whether or not murderers deserve to die is the wrong one .<-->O
The real question is whether other humans have a right to kill them . ''<-->O
He concluded that they do not after conversations with an opponent of capital punishment who asked , `` Why do n't we torture prisoners ?<-->N
Torturing them is less than killing them . ''<-->N
Mr. Syski believes that `` torture is dehumanizing , but capital punishment is the essence of dehumanization . ''<-->N
Richard Viguerie reached his positions on abortion and capital punishment independently , but does see a connection between the two issues : `` To me , life is sacred , '' Mr. Viguerie says .<-->N
`` And I do n't believe I have a right to terminate someone else 's life either way by abortion or capital punishment . ''<-->O
Many others in the prolife movement have come to the same conclusion .<-->N
They do n't think they have a right to play God , and they do n't believe that the state encourages respect for life when it engages in premediated killing .<-->O
Camus was right : We know enough to say that some crimes require severe punishment .<-->O
We do not know enough to say when anyone should die .<-->O
---------------- Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed ?<-->N
Summary : Whether or not the death penalty should be allowed .<-->O
Some crimes are so culpable that death is the only suitable penalty .<-->O
I believe that the death penalty should be put into effect and if a human kills another human being , they should pay the crime .<-->O
If someone has enough nerve to take the lives of others , then they too should have their life taken from them .<-->O
Those are the people that simply do not deserve to live .<-->O
Life is our most precious possession .<-->N
this is exactly what Capital punishment does .<-->N
Capital punishment lets all murderers know that they will have to abandon their lives if they take the life of someone else .<-->O
More than 20,000 people are killed each year and to let the animals -LRB- you ca n't even call them humans -RRB- survive is unjust .<-->O
The stricter our state is with its punishment , the more people will know not to commit murders .<-->O
American citizens need to know that chastisements are proportionate and fair .<-->O
For each killing that occurs , 8 possible victims are spared .<-->N
We ca n't risk the chance that execution does not save the lives of potential victims .<-->N
Since the United States does not have an official religious code to interpret right from wrong , we have to depend on our criminal laws .<-->O
If the laws are not strict enough , as the Death Penalty is , it is too enticing for our criminals .<-->O
Therefore making it easier for criminals to kill .<-->N
Harsh , severe laws provide an important measure of society 's values and morals .<-->O
How can the government be `` soft on crime '' '' How can they let others kill innocent people ?<-->O
We have to enforce the Death penalty , because once again , life is the most precious thing one can receive .<-->O
------------ 5 Arguments For And Against The Death Penalty The existence of the death penalty in any society raises one underlying question : have we established our justice systems out of a desire for rehabilitation , or out of a desire for retribution ?<-->O
The lister has set out to examine both sides of the debate over the ethics and legality of capital punishment , especially in the US , and chooses neither side in any of the following entries .<-->O
They are not presented in any meaningful order What is the purpose of punishment ?<-->N
We take our lead from one major source , our parents and they no doubt took their lead from their own parents .<-->N
When your young child emulates what he just saw in a Rambo movie , you give him a stern lecture about what is real and what is not , what is acceptable in real life and what is not .<-->O
When your child tries some crazy acrobatic move off a piece of furniture and hurts himself , you might spank him to be sure that he remembers never to do it again .<-->O
So when the child grows up , breaks into a home , and steals electronics , he gets caught and goes to prison .<-->N
His time in prison is meant to deprive him of the freedom to go where he wants anywhere in the world , and to do what he wants when he wants .<-->O
This is the punishment , and most people do learn from it .<-->N
In general , no one wants to go back .<-->N
But if that child grows up and murders someone for their wallet or just for fun , and they are in turn put to death , they are taught precisely nothing , because they are no longer alive to learn from it .<-->O
We can not rehabilitate a person by killing him or her .<-->N
Nevertheless , if would-be criminals know undoubtedly that they will be put to death should they murder with premeditation , very many of them are much less inclined to commit murder .<-->O
Whether or not would-be criminals are wary of committing the worst crime is an important and probably impossible question to answer .<-->O
Murder still happens very frequently .<-->N
So some criminals disregard this warning for various reasons .<-->N
But the fact does remain that many criminals who ride the fence on committing murder ultimately decide to spare the victim s life .<-->O
In a larger sense , capital punishment is the ultimate warning against all crimes .<-->O
If the criminal knows that the justice system will not stop at putting him to death , then the system appears more draconian to him .<-->O
Hence , he is less inclined to break and enter .<-->O
He may have no intention of killing anyone in the process of robbing them , but is much more apprehensive about the possibility if he knows he will be executed .<-->O
Thus , there is a better chance that he will not break and enter in the first place .<-->O
If the foreknowledge of any punishment is meant to dissuade the criminal from committing the crime , why do people still murder others ?<-->O
The US had a 2012 murder rate of 4.8 victims per 100,000 meaning that nearly 15,000 people were victims of homicide that year .<-->N
Capital punishment does not appear to be doing its job ; it doesn t seem to be changing every criminal s mind about killing innocent people .<-->O
If it does not dissuade , then it serves no purpose .<-->N
The warning of life in prison without parole must equally dissuade criminals .<-->O
There are many victims of a single murder .<-->N
The criminal gets caught , tried , and convicted , and it is understood that the punishment will be severe .<-->O
But the person he has killed no longer has a part to play in this .<-->N
Unfortunately , the murderer has deprived his family and friends of a loved one .<-->N
Their grief begins with the murder .<-->N
It may not end with the murderer s execution , but the execution does engender a feeling of relief at no longer having to think about the ordeal a feeling which often fails to arise while the murderer still lives on .<-->O
A system in place for the purpose of granting justice can not do so for the surviving victims , unless the murderer himself is put to death It is strange that a nation would denounce the practice of murder by committing the very same act .<-->O
By doing so , we re essentially championing the right to life by taking it from others .<-->O
True as a whole , we are not murderers , and understandably refuse to be placed in the same category as someone like Ted Bundy .<-->O
But to many opponents of the death penalty , even Ted Bundy should have been given life without parole .<-->O
The fact that he murdered at least thirty people for the mere reason that he enjoyed doing it has no bearing on the hypocrisy , the flagrant dishonesty , of the declaration that such a person deserves to be killed because he had no right to kill .<-->O
If the goal of any punishment , as stated above , is to teach us those things we should not do , then the justice system should more adequately teach the criminality of killing by refusing to partake in it .<-->O
If you read about Bundy s life in prison , waiting nine years for his execution , you will see that the man exhausted every single legal point he and his lawyers could think of , all in an attempt to spare him execution .<-->O
He defended himself in prison interviews by blaming pornography for causing his uncontrollable teenage libido , and for causing him to think of women as objects and not humans .<-->N
He attempted to have his death sentence commuted to life without parole by explaining that it was all pornography s fault , and that had it never existed , he would have been a good person .<-->O
When that didn t work , he pretended to come clean and tell police where the bodies of unfound victims were , so that their families could have closure .<-->O
He never once admitted that he was a bad person , and just before his execution , he claimed that he hadn t done anything wrong .<-->O
It was obvious that he feared being put to death .<-->N
He did his best to avert it .<-->N
This means that he did not fear life in prison at least not as much as he feared capital punishment .<-->O
He had many opportunities to kill himself in his cell , but he did not .<-->N
He might have done it a month before his execution , when all hope for clemency was gone but he was afraid of death .<-->O
How many would-be murderers have turned away at the last second purely out of fear of the executioner s needle ?<-->N
In the end , though , death is always at least a little painful .<-->O
Perhaps the only truly peaceful way to go is while asleep but no one has ever come back to say that this didn t hurt .<-->O
If your heart stops while you sleep , it is certainly possible that your brain will recognize a problem and wake you up at the very moment when it is too late .<-->O
So what we can not help but let Nature do , we ought not to force on others for any reason .<-->O
If we do so , it might be fair to say that we law-abiding people , who embody the justice system , are guilty of equal cruelty towards criminals who commit murder .<-->O
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights , for one , dictates that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .<-->O
In the US , there are five legal methods of execution : lethal injection , electrocution , firing squad , hanging , and gassing .<-->N
These are all intended to be as painless as possible , but they all run the risk of accidents .<-->O
John Wayne Gacy , who was not afraid of death , was executed via lethal injection the most efficient , risk-free method .<-->O
Yet his death did not go as planned .<-->N
The sodium thiopental entered his bloodstream successfully and put him to sleep .<-->N
The pancuronium bromide was then administered successfully to paralyze his diaphragm .<-->N
This would cause asphyxiation if the next chemical , potassium chloride , were not immediately administered to stop the heart .<-->O
But the potassium chloride had congealed in its tube before Gacy was brought into the room .<-->N
He was unconscious and unable to breathe for several minutes while the last drug s tube was changed .<-->N
His death took eighteen minutes , instead of the usual seven .<-->N
And whether or not he was in great pain is impossible to determine It s true that cruelty should not be legally tolerated and the five methods listed above are very efficient in killing the condemned before he or she is able to feel it .<-->O
Granted , we are not able to ask the dead whether or not they felt their necks snap , or the chemicals burn inside them but modern American executions very rarely go awry .<-->O
It does happen , but the reported accidents since 1976 number about ten nationwide , out of 1,328 .<-->N
When the condemned is fastened into the electric chair , one of the conductors is strapped securely around the head with the bare metal flush against the shaved and wet scalp .<-->N
This permits the electricity to be conducted directly into the brain , shutting it off more quickly than the brain can register pain .<-->N
Hanging causes death by snapping the neck of the condemned around the second vertebrae instantly shutting off the brain s ability to communicate with the rest of the body , and causing the heart to stop within seconds .<-->O
The firing squad involves five men shooting the heart of the condemned with high-powered rifles .<-->N
The heart is completely destroyed and unconsciousness follows within seconds .<-->N
The gas chamber is now no longer forced on the condemned , because it frequently appeared to cause more pain than was expected or acceptable .<-->O
The gas is usually hydrogen cyanide , which inhibits mitochondrial respiration in every cell of the entire body , theoretically shutting off the brain like a light switch .<-->O
But it requires that the condemned breathe deeply .<-->N
Consider a pedophile who kills an infant girl by raping her .<-->N
There is an unwritten code of honor in prisons that virtually requires inmates to kill such offenders .<-->O
Probably half of America s prisoners were in some way abused as children , and harbor a seething hatred for those who abuse children .<-->O
The murdering pedophile is given the death penalty , but will probably spend ten years beforehand in prison .<-->O
He will most likely be housed in solitary confinement for his own protection , but there are frequently holes in such protection , and the inmates may find their way to him .<-->O
And if this happens , pedophiles are often gang-raped , castrated , beaten to death , stabbed , and sometimes even beheaded before guards who may deliberately ignore the scene can save them .<-->O
Most prisoners consider each other to be in the same predicament , and treat each other quite well in general .<-->O
But they are still in prison , and despair about their lack of freedom .<-->O
What is life like for Zacarias Moussaoui , the member of the September 11 hijacking teams who got caught a month before the attack ?<-->N
A single juror saved him from death .<-->N
He has , since 2006 , been incarcerated for twenty-three hours per day in a tiny concrete cell , with one hour of daily exercise in an empty concrete swimming pool ; he has no access to other inmates , and only rare contact with guards , who say nothing to him ; he can see nothing of the outside world except a tiny sliver of sky and his will be his life .<-->O
Capital punishment is an unnecessary threat .<-->N
The justice system basically attempts to mete out punishment that fits the crime .<-->O
Severe crimes result in imprisonment .<-->N
Petty larceny is not treated with the severity that is meted to grand theft auto , and the latter , consequently , receives more time in prison .<-->O
So if severe but non-lethal violence toward another is found deserving of life without parole , then why should premeditated homicide be given the very same punishment ?<-->O
This fact might induce a would-be criminal to go ahead and kill the victim he has already mugged and crippled .<-->O
Why would it matter , after all ?<-->N
His sentence could not get any worse .<-->N
If murder is the willful deprivation of a victim s right to life , then the justice system s willful deprivation of the criminal s right to the same is even if overly severe a punishment which fits the most severe crime that can be committed .<-->O
Without capital punishment , it could be argued that the justice system makes no provision in response to the crime of murder , and thus provides no justice for the victim .<-->O
----------------- Should the death penalty be abolished ?<-->N
Capital punishment is on the books in 37 states , and in the federal courts .<-->N
YES When the United States was founded more than two centuries ago , prisons were a rarity .<-->N
But capital punishment was commonplace in the 13 Colonies , as well as in England and across Europe .<-->N
Today , almost two thirds of the world 's countries , including virtually all of Europe , have abolished the death penalty .<-->N
It is time for the U.S. to follow this trend : The death penalty is a fundamentally flawed public policy that has outlived any usefulness it may have once had .<-->O
Since 1976 , at least 124 people have been freed from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged , proving that the system is prone to human error .<-->O
Furthermore , the death penalty discriminates on the basis of race , geography , and income level : Death sentences are more likely to be handed down when the murder victim is white .<-->O
Some states use the death penalty ; some do n't .<-->N
And people who can afford good lawyers generally do n't receive death sentences .<-->O
Because death penalty trials are lengthy and the appeals process is complex , the system is not only costly , but it can take years before executions are carried out .<-->O
Indeed , hundreds of the almost 3,400 people on death row in the U.S. have been there 20 years or longer and many are not even close to execution .<-->O
Fortunately , there is a sound alternative to capital punishment : life in prison without parole .<-->N
We can keep our communities safe and can join the international community by abandoning this medieval form of punishment .<-->N
It is time to abolish the death penalty .<-->O
David Elliot National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty NO Capital punishment is an extreme sanction that is properly reserved for the worst of the worst : serial killers like Ted Bundy and terrorists like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh .<-->O
Over the past decade , the murder rate has dropped dramatically .<-->N
Several recent academic studies show a clear deterrent effect from judicious use of the death penalty : For each actual execution , about 17 murders are prevented , the studies show .<-->O
Opponents claim that there are innocent people on death row .<-->O
While that may be true , the number of innocent people who have been executed is zero .<-->N
The reason is that in every state that allows capital punishment , murderers found guilty get a series of appeals that result in an average 12-year delay between sentence and execution .<-->N
Beyond that , DNA testing can now establish with virtual certainty in many cases whether someone is , in fact , the killer .<-->N
On the other hand , we can count in the hundreds the innocent victims who died because we allowed convicted murderers to get out of prison .<-->N
Some claim life without parole is an appropriate alternative to the death penalty .<-->O
But a key reason many killers agree to accept sentences of life without parole in plea deals is the specter of a death sentence .<-->O
If we can establish that a killer is absolutely guilty and has a track record that suggests he will seriously hurt or kill again , what do we say to his future victims if we allow him to live ?<-->O
The answer is that we need capital punishment for those rare cases in which the killer is beyond redemption .<-->O
Joshua Marquis District Attorney , Clatsop County , Oregon ------------- Death Penalty Persuasive Essay This assignment instructed students to write a persuasive essay which argues for a specific viewpoint or a specific action to be taken on a societal issue .<-->O
I argued for a specific stance to be taken on the issue of the death penalty .<-->O
The audience for this essay is the opinion section of the Sunday New York Times .<-->N
This publication has a wide readership .<-->N
The largest percentage of readers are between the ages of 35 and 44 , and the majority of readers have either a college degree or a graduate degree .<-->N
This essay argues for a question of value .<-->N
The death penalty is an issue that has the United States quite divided .<-->O
While there are many supporters of it , there is also a large amount of opposition .<-->N
Currently , there are thirty-three states in which the death penalty is legal and seventeen states that have abolished it -LRB- Death Penalty Information Center -RRB- .<-->N
I believe the death penalty should be legal throughout the nation .<-->O
There are many reasons as to why I believe the death penalty should be legalized in all states , including deterrence , retribution , and morality ; and because opposing arguments do not hold up , I will refute the ideas that the death penalty is unconstitutional , irrevocable mistakes are made , and that there is a disproportionality of race and income level .<-->O
The use of capital punishment greatly deters citizens from committing crimes such as murder .<-->O
Many people s greatest fear is death ; therefore if they know that death is a possible consequence for their actions , they are less likely to perform such actions .<-->O
Ernest van den Haag , a professor at Fordham University , wrote about the issue of deterrence : capital punishment is likely to deter more than other punishments because people fear death more than anything else .<-->O
They fear most death deliberately inflicted by law and scheduled by the courts .<-->O
Hence , the threat of the death penalty may deter some murderers who otherwise might not have been deterred .<-->O
And surely the death penalty is the only penalty that could deter prisoners already serving a life sentence and tempted to kill a guard , or offenders about to be arrested and facing a life sentence .<-->O
-LRB- Death Penalty Curricula for High School -RRB- van den Haag brings forth the argument that capital punishment is the strongest deterrent society has against murder , which has been proven in many studies .<-->O
Since society has the highest interest in preventing murder , it should use the strongest punishment available to deter murder -LRB- Death Penalty Curricula for High School -RRB- .<-->O
In a study conducted by Isaac Ehrlich in 1973 , it was found that for each execution of a criminal seven potential victim s lives were saved -LRB- Death Penalty Curricula for High School -RRB- .<-->N
This was due to other possible murderers being deterred from committing murder after realizing thatother criminals are executed for their crimes .<-->N
Ehrlich s argument was also backed up by studies following his that had similar results .<-->N
Capital punishment also acts as a deterrent for recidivism -LRB- the rate at which previously convicted criminals return to committing crimes after being released -RRB- ; if the criminal is executed he has no opportunity to commit crimes again .<-->O
Some may argue that there is not enough concrete evidence to use deterrence as an argument for the death penalty .<-->O
The reason some evidence may be inconclusive is that the death penalty often takes a while to be carried out ; some prisoners sit on death row for years before being executed .<-->O
This can influence the effectiveness of deterrence because punishments that are carried out swiftly are better examples to others .<-->O
Although the death penalty is already effective at deterring possible criminals , it would be even more effective if the legal process were carried out more quickly instead of having inmates on death row for years .<-->O
The death penalty also carries out retribution justly .<-->O
Deserved punishment protects society morally by restoring this just order , making the wrongdoer pay a price equivalent to the harm he has done .<-->O
-LRB- Budziszewski -RRB- .<-->N
When someone commits a crime it disturbs the order of society ; these crimes take away lives , peace , and liberties from society .<-->N
Giving the death penalty as a punishment simply restores order to society and adequately punishes the criminal for his wrongdoing .<-->O
Retribution also serves justice for murder victims and their families .<-->N
Some may see this as revenge , but this retribution is not motivated by malice , rather it is motivated by the need for justice and the principle of lex talionis -LRB- an eye for an eye -RRB- -LRB- Green -RRB- .<-->O
This lack of malice is proven in the simple definition of retribution : retribution is a state sponsored , rational response to criminality that is justified given that the state is the victim when a crime occurs -LRB- Justifications for Capital Punishment -RRB- .<-->O
The death penalty puts the scales of justice back in balance after they were unfairly tipped towards the criminal .<-->O
The morality of the death penalty has been hotly debated for many years .<-->O
Those opposed to the death penalty say that it is immoral for the government to take the life of a citizen under any circumstance .<-->O
This argument is refuted by Immanuel Kant who put forth the idea that , a society that is not willing to demand a life of somebody who has taken somebody else s life is simply immoral -LRB- ProCon.org -RRB- .<-->O
It is immoral to not properly punish a person who has committed such a horrendous crime .<-->O
The criminal is also executed humanely ; in no way is he subjected to torture or any form of cruelty .<-->O
All states that use the death penalty use lethal injection ; the days of subjecting a prisoner to hanging or the electric chair are long gone in the US .<-->O
Inmates are first given a large dose of an anesthetic so they do not feel any pain -LRB- Bosner -RRB- ; this proves that the process is made as humane as possible so the inmates do not physically suffer .<-->O
Although the issue of morality is very personal for many people , it is important to see the facts and realize that capital punishment does take morality into account and therefore is carried out in the best way possible .<-->O
The eighth amendment to the United States Constitution prevents cruel and unusual punishment .<-->N
Many opponents of capital punishment say that execution is cruel and unusual punishment and therefore violates the Constitution .<-->O
As was stated earlier , the recipient of the death penalty is treated humanely and is not tortured in any way , shape , or form .<-->O
After the anesthetic is administered the person feels no pain ; the only part of the process that could be considered painful is when the IV is inserted , but that is done in hospitals on a daily basis and no one is calling it unconstitutional .<-->O
The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the death penalty as constitutional in cases they have presided over .<-->O
In the case of Furman v. Georgia the court stated , The punishment of death is not cruel , within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution .<-->O
It implies there is something more inhuman and barbarous , than the mere extinguishment of life -LRB- Lowe -RRB- .<-->O
The Supreme Court has not found capital punishment to be unconstitutional , and therefore this argument for abolition is invalid .<-->O
Another argument put forth by death penalty abolitionists is the possibility of executing an innocent person .<-->O
Many people that argue this overestimate how often this happens , it is an extremely rare occurrence and has not happened since the death penalty was reintroduced in 1976 .<-->O
Steven D. Stewart , the Prosecuting Attorney for Clark County Indiana , very effectively refutes this argument : No system of justice can produce results which are 100 % certain all the time .<-->O
Mistakes will be made in any system which relies upon human testimony for proof .<-->N
We should be vigilant to uncover and avoid such mistakes .<-->O
Our system of justice rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases .<-->O
However , the risk of making a mistake with the extraordinary due process applied in death penalty cases is very small , and there is no credible evidence to show that any innocent persons have been executed at least since the death penalty was reactivated in 1976 The inevitability of a mistake should not serve as grounds to eliminate the death penalty any more than the risk of having a fatal wreck should make automobiles illegal -LRB- ProCon.org -RRB- Stewart points out that death penalty cases are held to a much higher standard .<-->O
Due process in these cases takes much longer so that the court can be absolutely sure that the person is guilty before sentencing him to execution .<-->O
This helps to eliminate any errors that could lead to executing the wrong person .<-->O
He also points out that although there is a small possibility for mistakes to be made , this does not mean capital punishment should be abolished .<-->O
If everything that had the potential for harmful mistakes were outlawed , society would be extremely crippled .<-->O
It is true that there is disproportionality when it comes to the races and classes that most frequently receive the death penalty .<-->O
It has been proven that minorities and those with lower income levels are overrepresented on death row .<-->N
This is not due to discrimination ; this is due to the higher rate at which these groups commit crime -LRB- ProCon.org -RRB- .<-->N
It has been argued that poverty breeds criminality ; if this is true then it makes sense that those at a lower income level would more frequently be sentenced to execution than those at higher income levels -LRB- ProCon.org -RRB- .<-->O
It has also been proven that minorities are disproportionately poor , and therefore they would also be more likely to receive the death penalty .<-->O
Ernest van den Haag said it best : Punishments are imposed on persons , not on economic groups .<-->N
Guilt is personal .<-->N
The only relevant question is : does the person to be executed deserve the punishment ?<-->N
Whether or not others deserved the same punishment , whatever the economic or racial group , have avoided execution is irrelevant .<-->O
-LRB- ProCon.org -RRB- It does not matter what race or economic status a person is , if he is guilty he must receive the appropriate punishment , which in some cases may be the death penalty .<-->O
Capital punishment can be a difficult topic to approach because people tend to have extreme views on it .<-->O
The death penalty is an asset to society ; it deters potential criminals as well as serves retribution to criminals , and is in no way immoral .<-->O
The arguments against the death penalty often do not hold up when examined more closely .<-->O
It is important that the nation is united on this issue , rather than having some states use capital punishment while others do not .<-->O
The death penalty can be an extremely useful tool in sentencing criminals that have committed some of the worst crimes known to society .<-->O
It is imperative that we begin to pass legislation making capital punishment legal throughout the United States so that justice can be served properly .<-->O
--------------------------------- Facts May 31st , 2013 There are many reasons the death penalty should be abolished .<-->O
It is a complex issue and it is difficult to point to any single fact or argument as the most important .<-->O
1 -RRB- Executions are carried out at staggering cost to taxpayers .<-->N
It costs far more to execute a person than to keep him or her in prison for life .<-->N
A 2011 study found that California has spent more than $ 4 billion on capital punishment since it was reinstated in 1978 and that death penalty trials are 20 times more expensive than trials seeking a sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole .<-->O
California currently spends $ 184 million on the death penalty each year and is on track to spend $ 1 billion in the next five years .<-->N
2 -RRB- There is no credible evidence that capital punishment deters crime .<-->N
Scientific studies have consistently failed to demonstrate that executions deter people from committing crime anymore than long prison sentences .<-->O
Moreover , states without the death penalty have much lower murder rates .<-->O
The South accounts for more than 80 % of US executions and has the highest regional murder rate .<-->N
3 -RRB- Innocent people have been convicted and executed .<-->N
The wrongful execution of an innocent person is an injustice that can never be rectified .<-->O
Since the reinstatement of the death penalty , more than 150 men and women have been released from Death Row nationally ... some only minutes away from execution .<-->N
Moreover , in the past two years evidence has come to light which indicates that four men may have been wrongfully EXECUTED in recent years for crimes they did not commit .<-->N
This error rate is simply appalling , and completely unacceptable , when we are talking about life and death .<-->O
4 -RRB- Race plays a role in determining who lives and who dies .<-->N
The race of the victim and the race of the defendant in capital cases are major factors in determining who is sentenced to die in this country .<-->N
In 1990 a report from the General Accounting Office concluded that `` in 82 percent of the studies -LSB- reviewed -RSB- , race of the victim was found to influence the likelihood of being charged with capital murder or receiving the death penalty , i.e. those who murdered whites were more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered blacks . ''<-->O
5 -RRB- The death penalty is applied at random .<-->N
Politics , quality of legal counsel and the jurisdiction where a crime is committed are more often the determining factors in a death penalty case than the facts of the crime itself .<-->O
The death penalty is a lethal lottery : of the 22,000 homicides committed every year approximately 100 people or less are sentenced to death .<-->O
6 -RRB- Capital punishment goes against almost every religion .<-->N
Although isolated passages of religious scripture have been quoted in support of the death penalty , almost all religious groups in the United States regard executions as immoral .<-->O
7 -RRB- The USA is keeping company with notorious human rights abusers .<-->N
The vast majority of countries in Western Europe , North America and South America more than 140 nations worldwide have abandoned capital punishment in law or in practice .<-->N
The United States remains in the same company as Iraq , Iran , North Korea , and China as one of the major advocates and users of capital punishment .<-->N
8 -RRB- Millions currently spent on the death penalty could be used to assist the families of murder victims .<-->O
Many family members who have lost love ones to murder feel that the death penalty will not heal their wounds nor will it end their pain ; the extended process prior to executions can prolong the agony experienced by the family .<-->O
Funds now being used for the costly process of executions could be used to help families put their lives back together through counseling , restitution , crime victim hotlines , and other services addressing their needs .<-->O
9 -RRB- Bad Lawyers are a Persistent Problem in Capital Cases Perhaps the most important factor in determining whether a defendant will receive the death penalty is the quality of the representation he or she is provided .<-->O
Almost all defendants in capital cases can not afford their own attorneys .<-->N
In many cases , the appointed attorneys are overworked , underpaid , or lacking the trial experience required for death penalty cases .<-->O
There have even been instances in which lawyers appointed to a death case were so inexperienced that they were completely unprepared for the sentencing phase of the trial .<-->O
Other appointed attorneys have slept through parts of the trial , or arrived at the court under the influence of alcohol .<-->O
10 -RRB- Life Without Parole is a Sensible Alternative to the Death Penalty In every state that retains the death penalty , jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole .<-->O
The sentence is cheaper to tax-payers and keeps violent offenders off the streets for good .<-->N
Unlike the death penalty , a sentence of Life Without Parole also allows mistakes to be corrected .<-->O
There are currently over 3,300 people in California who have received this alternative sentence , which also has a more limited appeals process last approximately 3 years .<-->N
According to the California Governor 's Office , only seven people sentenced to life without parole have been released since the state provided for this option in 1977 , and this occurred because they were able to prove their innocence .<-->O
university-education-should-be-free 1 .<-->N
How we could solve the riddle of higher education funding Education has long been seen as a principal source of economic mobility .<-->N
But for years now public education , and especially public higher education , has been under attack .<-->N
American states now spend one-fifth less per public college student on average than they did a decade ago .<-->N
In California , which once boasted a public higher education system that was the envy of the entire world , state funding per-student has been cut in half .<-->O
As a result , despite the fact that fees for tuition , room and board have been rising faster than inflation for the last 20 years , public universities in the US have been forced to make deep cuts in the programmes and services they provide to make up for this hole in their budgets .<-->O
Similar cuts have been made in the UK , where in the name of rebalancing the budget , the government seems determined to dismantle what has been an extraordinarily successful system of public-financed higher education and replace it with one modelled on the private debt-financed system of higher education that is already on the verge of collapse in the US .<-->O
Because neither the existing US nor the prior UK funding model seems to have much of a future in the current economic and political climate , what I propose is this : public higher education should be free at the point of entry .<-->O
Not means-tested , not cheap , not subsidised , but free .<-->N
For everybody .<-->N
Instead of cash up front , what would be required is a promise to pay a certain amount of one 's taxable income say 6 % for one 's prime earning years -LRB- 35-54 -RRB- to the university that provides one 's undergraduate degree .<-->O
These promises would then be stacked together for each university class or cohort -LRB- for example , the class of 2018 -RRB- , securitised , and sold to investors at home and abroad .<-->N
Through the securitisation process , investors would acquire an equity interest in the average income of the entire cohort .<-->O
Because average income moves with inflation , these securities would be largely risk-free , and therefore would be very attractive to investors .<-->O
Indeed , with a 6 % promise from every cohort member , the securities should sell now for at least enough to pay for the education of the entire cohort , thereby relieving the government of doing so and freeing up large amounts of resources to be redirected to primary and secondary education .<-->O
Some of these savings could even be returned to the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts .<-->N
The payments ultimately made by each individual student would bear a strong relation to what turned out to be the financial value of their university degree , something that does not necessarily happen now .<-->O
For those who earned more would pay more , and this would tie what one pays for one 's education more tightly to the economic value one receives .<-->O
Payments would be made along with tax payments and processed by the relevant government tax authority -LRB- the IRS in the US and the Inland Revenue in the UK -RRB- .<-->N
They would provide enforcement services against those who failed to pay , but given that payments due are tied to income received , failures to pay should be rare .<-->O
They should be far less than the default rate on student loans , which currently hovers around 7 % .<-->N
And unlike the current system for capping and forgiving student debts , no contribution from the public purse would be necessary to ensure that these payments were affordable for all , for affordability would be built into the very nature of the promise .<-->O
Look at what this does .<-->N
It satisfies the concerns of the left : everyone would be able to get a high quality higher education no matter what economic resources they or their families currently enjoy .<-->O
No longer would poor students have to choose between working long hours at menial low-wage jobs to finance their education , thereby jeopardising their ability to perform well in or even complete their courses , and taking on large debts they can not begin to pay .<-->O
Under my proposal , no one would be forced to pursue high-income occupations in which they were not really interested for fear of being otherwise unable to pay their education debts .<-->O
And most importantly , the securitisation process would offer the giant , insatiable , worldwide pool of private capital currently out there looking for a safe place to go a way to invest in the earning potential of the product of the nation 's public institutions of higher education .<-->O
Instead of merely being used to create economic weapons of mass destruction , the advanced techniques developed by the financial services industry would now be able to be used for a far more constructive purpose creating investment vehicles of mass education .<-->O

How The Government Could Make Public College Free For All Students Tuition at public colleges came to $ 62.6 billion in 2012 , according to the latest government data .<-->F
That s less than what the government already spends to subsidize the cost of college through grants , tax breaks , and work-study funds , which comes to about $ 69 billion .<-->F
It spends another $ 107.4 billion on student loans .<-->N
That means that with the money it already spends to make college affordable , the government could instead subsidize public college tuition , thereby making it free for all students .<-->O
This would not just mean anyone could attend a higher education institution without worrying about cost , but it could incentivize private ones to reduce their costs in order to compete with the free option .<-->O
It would also address the government s current patchwork attempts to make college affordable , which isn t working for many low - and middle-income families .<-->O
Tax-based aid is mostly delivered to wealthy families , not the ones in need .<-->O
Pell Grants , on the other hand , were cut in 2012 , which meant students got less aid or kicked out altogether , after already covering the smallest percentage of college costs since the program was created .<-->O
-LRB- House Republicans have had the program in their sights for even more cuts . -RRB-<-->N
The cost of college has been rising dramatically in recent years , with the price tag for attending a public four-year university climbing 27 percent and the cost of a private education rising by 13 .<-->N
At the same time , more and more students have been taking on debt to help finance their educations , with total debt now past the $ 1 trillion mark .<-->N
This puts the burden of rising costs on them , which can sometimes be heavy .<-->N
One in eight of those student borrowers is now in default .<-->N
There are other ways to address this growing problem .<-->N
One would be to allow student debtors in dire straits to discharge their debts in bankruptcy , something that is nearly impossible to do now .<-->O
Another , which could help stop the problem before it gets so bad , would be to automatically enroll children in college savings accounts at birth that get publicly matched , which would help families pay for college and would give low-income students better chances of enrolling .<-->O
President Obama has proposed a pay for performance system to help rein in costs , which would create a ratings system that measured college s performance and tie aid to how they perform , eventually incentivizing them to improve on metrics like graduation rates and the debt their graduates carry .<-->O
But the evidence from similar state-based efforts is mixed on how big of an impact it can have .<-->N
Should University Education be Free ?<-->F
In recent years , the government has sought to increase the amount students pay for studying at university .<-->F
In the UK , the government have phased out grants and introduced top-up fees .<-->N
With tuition fees and rising living costs , students could end up paying 50,000 for a three year degree , and leave university with significant debts .<-->N
Some argue this is a mistake .<-->O
Charging for university education will deter students and leave the UK with a shortfall of skilled labour and arguably this will damage the long term prospects of the UK economy .<-->O
Furthermore , charging for university will increase inequality of opportunity as students with low income parents will be more likely to be deterred from going to university .<-->O
Arguments for Free University Education 1 .<-->N
Positive externalities of higher education .<-->F
Generally , university education does offer some external benefits to society .<-->N
Higher education leads to a more educated and productive workforce .<-->N
Countries with high rates of university education generally have higher levels of innovation and productivity growth .<-->N
Therefore , there is a justification for the government subsidising higher education .<-->N
There is also a powerful argument that university education should be free to ensure equality of opportunity .<-->O
If students have to pay for university education , this may dissuade them .<-->N
In theory , students could take out loans or work part-time , but this may be sufficient to discourage students from studying and instead may enter the job market earlier .<-->O
Increased specialisation of work .<-->N
The global economy has forced countries , such as the UK to specialise in higher tech and higher value added products and services .<-->N
The UK s biggest export industries include pharmaceuticals , organic chemicals , optical and surgical instruments , and nuclear technology -LRB- see : what does the UK produce ? -RRB- .<-->N
Therefore , there is a greater need for skilled graduates who can contribute to these high-tech industries .<-->O
Arguments against free university education 1 .<-->N
Opportunity Cost .<-->N
If we spend billions on free university education there is an opportunity cost of higher taxes or less spending elsewhere .<-->O
Arguably , there is a greater social benefit from providing vocational training e.g. so people could become plumbers , electricians e.t.c. .<-->O
There is often a real shortage of these skills in an economy .<-->N
The UK commission for skills and education report significant skills shortages in the basic core generic skills such as literacy , numeracy and communication skills .<-->O
This skill shortages are prominent in industries like building , health care , plumbing , social care and construction .<-->O
Generally , the problem is not a shortage of graduates with art degrees , but lower level vocational skills .<-->N
-LRB- See : BBC skills shortage in the UK -RRB- Therefore , there is a case for charging for university , but greater public spending to tackle this lower level skill shortages .<-->N
Do we have too many graduates ?<-->N
In recent decades there has been a rapid rise in the number of graduates .<-->N
But , many graduates are leaving university to take jobs which don t require a degree .<-->F
A study by the ONS found that nearly 50 % of workers who left university in the past five years are doing jobs which don t require a degree .<-->N
-LRB- Telegraph link -RRB- Therefore , it is a mistake to continue to fund the public expansion of university education because the economy doesn t need more graduates as much as other skills .<-->O
Higher quality of education .<-->N
The rapid rise in university numbers means that greater pressure is being put on university resources .<-->N
Since the government is struggling to maintain public spending , let alone increase spending , there is a danger that university education and research may suffer , causing UK education to lag behind other countries .<-->O
If universities can charge students , it will help maintain standards , quality of teaching and the reputation of UK universities . .<-->N
Makes people value education more .<-->N
If people have to pay to go to university , you could argue that they would value the education more .<-->O
If higher education is free , it may encourage students to take an easy three years of relaxation .<-->O
Signalling function of higher education .<-->F
Arguably , higher education acts as a signal to employers that graduates have greater capacity .<-->F
As a consequence , people who gain a degree , end up with a relatively higher salary .<-->N
Therefore , if they financially gain from studying at university , it is perhaps fair they pay part of the cost .<-->O
This is especially important for middle-class families , who send a higher proportion of people to higher education .<-->N
Another issue is whether we need 50 % of 18 year olds to go to university .<-->N
The increase in student numbers is a significant contributory factor to the increased financial pressures on universities .<-->N
Rather than encouraging students to automatically go to university -LRB- as some schools do -RRB- , it would be better to encourage more students to take vocational training and avoid three years of academic study .<-->O
If less went to university , it would mean the cost per student would be relatively lower .<-->O
Another issues is how do you charge students for going to university .<-->N
If students leave university with large debts , this has negative consequences .<-->N
But , if we finance university education through a graduate tax paid when graduates get a decent income then it may be less of a disincentive .<-->N
Should college be free ?<-->N
Should college education be free , or should university students be required to pay tuition fees ?<-->N
Some countries have free education from kindergarten to university , while students in other countries have to pay at every step of the way .<-->N
This essay will look at some of the reasons for this difference at university level .<-->O
Free third level education has several advantages .<-->N
First of all , everyone can attend , so the gap between rich and poor students decreases as poorer students have more opportunity .<-->O
The economy also benefits from the increased pool of highly educated labor .<-->N
An educated workforce attracts employers and foreign investment .<-->N
Socially , a more educated population should have more choices regarding nutrition , jobs and lifestyle .<-->N
An additional point is that university fees only contribute a small proportion of the university budget .<-->N
However , some people are opposed to free education .<-->N
First of all , through their taxes , poor families subsidize rich students who can easily afford to pay fees .<-->O
A second point is that spending government money on free education is often not possible or desirable when a country needs hospitals , roads , and primary or secondary schools .<-->O
A third point is that a university education is a choice , not a requirement .<-->N
People who finish college with advanced qualifications are going to earn large salaries and can easily afford to pay back loans .<-->O
Furthermore , when people get something for free , they often do not value it .<-->N
If college is free , many students will go there just because they can not think of anything else to do .<-->O
In conclusion , free third level education is not always a good thing .<-->N
Governments need to think carefully about their policies and ensure that they are using their resources to help all the people in the country equitably .<-->O
Responses to Should college be free ?<-->N
Education is widely regarded as a key factor in the economic and social development of a country , but there are different attitudes about whether students should pay or not .<-->O
Some regard education as a basic right , which should therefore be provided free , while others think the individual student should have to shoulder some of the costs of his or her education .<-->O
This essay will examine some of the arguments for and against free education at third level .<-->O
There are several reasons why university education in particular should be paid for by the students who receive it .<-->N
First of all , a university is a choice , not a requirement .<-->N
Nobody is forced to attend third level , and those who do are hoping to enter very well paid jobs .<-->N
Students entering professions such as engineering or medicine will be well able to repay loans or the cost of tuition .<-->O
A second point is that if students from rich families are receiving free university education from the state , they are increasing the load on the university and ministry of education and reducing the resources available for poorer students .<-->O
Furthermore , when people pay for something , they often value it more .<-->N
Students who get free education may enroll purely because they don t want to work or because they can t think of anything better to do , and this can lead to poor motivation and poor study habits .<-->O
However , there are sound economic and social reasons for making third level education free to all .<-->N
In the first place , a modern country needs highly skilled graduates of all kinds , rather than just high school leavers .<-->O
For many families , the high cost of tuition would discourage participation in third level education .<-->O
An important point is that the contribution of fees to the budget of any good university or college is relatively small , since almost all colleges rely on large amounts of government or philanthropic funding .<-->O
The money from fees may represent only a small part of the college budget .<-->N
A third point is that third level education is not purely vocational .<-->N
Students at college are not just being given technical skills desired by employers , but are questioning , analyzing , synthesizing and creating new knowledge , and this will be a tremendous resource to the society as a whole .<-->O
In conclusion , to allow as many people as possible to develop to their full potential and to develop the country , we need to make third level education available to all .<-->O
Restricting access to the elite will have detrimental effects on the society and the economy .<-->O
` Education should be free to everyone , at every level ' If today was the day you decided to go and gaze at the beautiful architecture of Westminster Abbey or hear Big Ben gong the hour , you ll have been in for a surprise .<-->O
Photo-snapping wasn t the only reason people were flocking to these sites in Westminster thousands of students were marching there to call on the government to change their education policies .<-->N
Clifford Fleming , Co-chair of the Young Greens , was at the march ; he told me : The Green Party believe everyone should have the opportunity to study further , no matter what their background .<-->O
Today we 'll be marching for free education , to abolish tuition fees , to fight the cuts in the education sector , and to challenge the marketisation of education .<-->O
Free education ?<-->N
Oh , but we can t afford that , I hear you mutter that s why the coalition scrapped the education maintenance allowance -LRB- EMA -RRB- and tripled university fees since coming into power four years ago .<-->N
I mean , what with the banking crisis and all the issues in the Eurozone , how is any government going to cover the cost of their nation s learning ?<-->O
Well actually , Germany seems to be doing it pretty well ; they recently scrapped fees for both national and international students ; it 's not simple , but it s not impossible after all .<-->O
Today 's demonstration , inspired by successes in other countries , was organised by The National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts , The Young Greens , and The Students Assembly Against Austerity .<-->N
NUS president , Toni Pearce , controversially pulled her support earlier this month , saying the march posed an unacceptable level of risk to members .<-->O
Beth Redmond , from the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts , explained why the march was necessary : Education is a public good , it benefits everyone in society , and , therefore , I believe it should be paid for by those who are most able to .<-->O
The state of your parent s bank account should not hinder your access to education .<-->N
Kirsty Haigh , NUS Scotland 's Vice President Communities also commented : We have come out because we firmly believe in free education ; we believe it should be accessible to everyone at every level .<-->O
`` We are lucky that in Scotland we have free education for undergraduate students , but we think that s not good enough , we think it should be for all students , at every level , no matter if you ve been through the system once or twice . ''<-->O
Personally , the atmosphere on the demo was for the most part fantastic ; striding side by side with thousands of students , workers , and pensioners .<-->N
Placards jostled above heads , with statements such as Free education , tax the rich , Books not bombs , Education is a right not a privilege , and This would never have happened at Hogwarts printed on them .<-->O
We chanted a variety of songs , such as No ifs , no buts , no education cuts , Biology and English lit , did not cause the deficit and What do we want ?<-->N
Free education !<-->N
When do we want it ?<-->N
Now ! .<-->N
You bet we want it now .<-->N
Ezra Schwalger-Jackson , from London Met , is paying just under 9,000 a year to study biomedical science .<-->N
She told me at the march : I can t pay my rent and I can t work because I m studying full time I m stuck .<-->N
`` I m also here because of people like single mums and families from -LSB- disadvantaged backgrounds -RSB- who can t afford education there are so many intelligent people out there who simply can not afford to be educated .<-->O
Callum Cant , from the University of Warwick , brought over 200 students to the demo .<-->N
He said : I was the first year paying the new fees and I m about to graduate with the full weight of 44,000 worth of debt .<-->N
The enthusiasm among students for this cause is palpable .<-->N
Students will come out in the streets if they think they can change something and today is about proving that they can .<-->O
This isn t just a demo ; this is a movement which will grow from this point onwards .<-->O
The march was going pretty peacefully until protesters tore down barriers at Parliament Square .<-->O
Dancing and chanting broke out on the grass .<-->N
Even though the music created was amazing -LRB- I think someone actually fashioned a makeshift drum -RRB- , it did mar the reputation of the protests ; surely if we say we re going to be peaceful , we should keep up our end of the deal ?<-->O
As I left , watching as protesters began to huddle around a speaker on a platform , I asked Tom Hymas , a human sciences student at Oxford , how he thought the day went .<-->N
He told me : I think the march was a success ; loads of people came down .<-->O
I think we made the point we wanted to .<-->N
Whether it will have any effect , we don t know but it s a starting point from which we can take more action towards changing the government s policy .<-->O
Germany and Quebec successfully introduced free education after mass protests changed their governments attitudes .<-->O
After the fees were tripled , we lost our faith and momentum .<-->N
But , hopefully , today will be the start of students showing the people in Westminster we are willing to fight for what we believe in .<-->O
Should college be free for everyone ?<-->N
If college is so necessary -LRB- college grads and higher have just a 3.3 % jobless rate -RRB- and so expensive -LRB- published tuition has more than doubled in real terms since 1980 -RRB- and student debt is so out-of-control -LRB- it now stands at $ 1.2 trillion -RRB- , then why not make college free for everyone ?<-->O
Why not make taxpayers pick up the cost for this important public good ?<-->N
It s an idea that pops up every now and then .<-->N
But expect lots more talk if Tennessee makes good on a proposal to offer two years of community college or technical school free for all students with a high school diploma or equivalency degree .<-->O
But government should think twice before creating a public option for higher education .<-->N
First , strong evidence that student outcomes will improve is lacking .<-->O
As AEI s Andrew Kelly points out , retention and completion rates at California s community colleges which have the nation s lowest published tuition and are free to many because of Pell grants were above the national average but below those at some schools with tuition several times higher .<-->N
Second , Tennessee s focus is misplaced .<-->N
The problem isn t how much students have to pay .<-->N
It s how much education costs .<-->N
As economist and college president Howard Bowen described the inflationary dynamic : colleges raise and then spend all the money can .<-->N
And why not ?<-->N
Students are at an information disadvantage .<-->N
They equate higher prices with higher quality and are unable to accurately gauge the value of specific institutions or programs .<-->O
Third , the adverse though unintended side effects could be quite large .<-->O
Significantly reducing costs and increasing value will require more cost-benefit transparency for students , as well as unbundling what colleges do .<-->O
We need to rethink the delivery of knowledge and credentials , explains AEI s Daniel K. Lautzenheiser , with reforms such as massive open online courses and competency-based education .<-->O
And these disruptive innovations are best generated by outside competitors who might be crowded by a public option .<-->O
It s also worth noting a 2004 New York Fed study that found a high-subsidy , low-tuition policies have disincentive effects on students study time and adversely affect human capital accumulation .<-->N
Finally , why exactly should taxpayers subsidize the higher education of kids who can afford it and will reap huge lifetime gains from more schooling ?<-->O
They shouldn t .<-->N
While the Tennessee proposal is correct in signalling the importance of increasing education levels , it distracts from more fundamental reform .<-->O
Why All Public Higher Education Should Be Free In his book The Price of Civilization , Jeffrey Sachs argues that the cost of making all public higher education free in America would be between fifteen and thirty billion dollars .<-->N
While this may sound like a large sum , it could actually save money .<-->O
First of all , the government is currently spending billions of dollars on for-profit schools and other colleges and universities that have very low graduation rates .<-->N
In fact , what is going on in the state of California is that as students get priced out of the University of California , they either drop out or go to community colleges .<-->N
Meanwhile as community colleges are defunded , they are forced to cut their enrollments and raise their fees , and the result is that students end up going to high-cost for-profit schools that have a very low graduate rate .<-->O
In other words , in the current system , everyone pays more , and we produce fewer graduates .<-->N
Currently , only 30 % of Americans who start college or university end up graduating , and this represents a huge waste of time and money .<-->N
If students did not have to work while in school , the graduation rate would improve drastically , and students at universities could graduate in four years instead of six or more years .<-->O
In fact , the biggest reason why students drop out of higher education is that they can not afford the high cost of tuition .<-->O
Not only is higher education seen as a key to economic advancement , but if all 18-24 year olds were in college , we would reduce the unemployment rate by 2 million people , and fewer people would be in need of governmental assistance .<-->O
Moreover , a federal program to fund higher education would relieve states of having to fund these institutions , which would free up money for other needed services .<-->O
While the US has a free K-12 public education , its failure to fund higher education means that America 's economy is unable to compete with other developed nations that have free universities .<-->O
Furthermore , by removing the need for students to go into debt , the government would allow graduates to be more productive , and they would have more money to spend , which in turn would act as a stimulus for the economy .<-->O
Of course , there are reasons beyond economics to provide free higher education .<-->N
Not only do we need a more educated workforce , but we also need more educated citizens .<-->O
It is also important to point out that people with higher education degrees report a higher level of health and happiness .<-->O
In fact , societies with a high rate of degree attainment have lower crime rates and higher rates of social welfare .<-->O
While President Obama has endorsed the need for the U.S. to increase the number of citizens with higher education degrees , he has done very little to support this process .<-->O
Not only do we need to push our politicians to support free universal higher education , but we have to show the voting populace that a federal program would help to alleviate the incredible expense that postsecondary education now costs middle-class families .<-->O
Along with funding higher education , the federal government could also rein in costs by setting realistic caps on tuition increases .<-->N
Moreover , by improving access and affordability , the government could improve the quality of instruction by forcing schools to concentrate their spending on research and instruction .<-->O
The federal government could also take on the task of rating and ranking colleges so that we are no longer dependent on US News & World Report , which has a corrosive influence on institutions of higher education .<-->O
Instead of schools spending money on lavish amenities , universities and colleges could be motivated to concentrate their resources on reducing class size and hiring more full-time faculty .<-->O
While few people would now reject the idea of compulsory K-12 education , it is now time to make college universal and free .<-->O
Four Reasons Why University Education Should Be Free Observations and analyses in this essay are those of the author , and are not to be attributed to the service provider or to any institution .<-->N
Four reasons why tuition should be free 1 .<-->N
Canada has committed itself in a legally-binding international treaty to abolishing university tuition fees .<-->N
Canada signed and in 1976 ratified -LRB- thereby giving it the force of law in Canada -RRB- the United Nations International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .<-->N
In this treaty the contracting parties commit themselves to `` the progressive introduction of free education '' at the post-secondary level , in conformity with their promise that `` Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all '' -LRB- Article 13.2 .<-->O
c -RRB- .<-->N
This treaty also requires that , with respect to social , economic and cultural rights , including education , the signatories do not practise `` discrimination of any kind as to ... national or social origin '' -LRB- Article 2.2 -RRB- .<-->O
In the thirty-seven years since Canada has ratified this covenant , not only has free post-secondary education not been progressively introduced in Canada as the treaty requires , but the cost of post-secondary studies has increased dramatically in relation to the rate of inflation .<-->O
During the same period , most Canadian universities introduced discrimination on the basis of national origin by charging international students higher fees than Canadian students .<-->N
As Canada 's refusal to comply with its legal obligations under the Kyoto Accord on greenhouse gas emissions has vividly illustrated , there regrettably exists no legal mechanism to force `` rogue states '' to obey international laws that they have adopted .<-->O
Young people should not have to bear a debt of tens of thousands of dollars upon graduation .<-->N
The majority of graduating students in Canada -LRB- about 60 % -RRB- have had to borrow money to pay for their studies and begin their working lives with onerous debts .<-->N
Their debts upon graduation are on average close to $ 28,000 before interest payments , and typically $ 10,000 more including interest .<-->O
In Newfoundland and Labrador and in Nova Scotia , the average student debt on graduation is about $ 35,000 , while in Quebec , with its lower tuition fees before 2012 , it has been about $ 15,000 .<-->N
* These debts must be borne by a generation of graduates for whom finding suitable , long-term employment is not always an easy task -LRB- hence the title of the Globe and Mail article cited at the bottom of this page : `` Debt-ridden and unemployed '' -RRB- .<-->O
Canada is one of the richest countries in the world , and can afford post-secondary education for its young people as easily as -LRB- or , in many cases , more easily than -RRB- other countries that do not have tuition fees .<-->O
In many countries of the world -LRB- for example Argentina , Ecuador , France , Sweden , Finland -RRB- , some of which are significantly poorer than Canada , there are no tuition fees or only small registration fees for citizens attending public universities .<-->N
It is reasonable to ask whether it is more helpful to the population of Canada to spend tax revenues paid by Canadian citizens on free post-secondary education , or to spend tens of billions of dollars on a war machine that does little or nothing for Canadians , such as the $ 28 billion -LRB- according to the Rideau Institute -RRB- on the failed invasion of Afghanistan , and on the deaths of all the Afghans and Canadians this war has killed .<-->O
Or , to cite other examples , does it help Canadians more to spend $ 35 billion on new warships and as much again on new warplanes , when Canada has not had to defend itself against an invasion for two centuries and when no one is threatening to invade the country ?<-->O
It is also reasonable to ask if universities could not themselves ensure that their internal spending choices give priority to academic programme expenses over , for example , promotional and management expenses .<-->O
In short , the claim that Canadian governments and universities `` just can not afford '' free tuition is groundless .<-->O
With regard to qualifications for employment , one or more university degrees are today the equivalent of a high school diploma forty years ago .<-->N
There are many careers requiring today one or more university degrees that previously did not : those of elementary school teachers , nurses , accountants , information specialists , etc. .<-->N
Therefore the proportion of the age group graduating from university today is even higher than the proportion graduating from high school forty years ago , yet no one suggested forty years ago that students should have to pay for their high school studies .<-->O
According to certain governments in Canada , 70 % of new jobs require post-secondary education , and half of Canada 's university graduates return to university to obtain a second degree in the hope of finding decent employment .<-->O
* In summary , it is clear that today post-secondary studies fall within the range of levels that citizens are expected to attain as part of their basic education , and that they are a constituent element of education as a fundamental human right that should be provided to young people without charge by the community as a whole .<-->O
The 2012 student movement in Quebec and the tuition debate The 2012 movement of students and their supporters against tuition fee increases in Quebec has brought the issue of the cost of post-secondary studies to the forefront of public debate in Canada .<-->O
Often this debate centres on the question of accessibility .<-->N
Do high tuition fees make it more difficult for young people to acquire an education ?<-->N
Detractors of the student movement argue that this is not the case .<-->N
They cite the fact , for example , that although Quebec now has the lowest tuition fees in the country , it does not have a higher participation rate in post-secondary studies than certain other provinces where these studies are more expensive .<-->O
However such reasoning wrongly assumes that there are not other factors , of a historical and social nature , that could account for the slightly lower rate of participation in Quebec than in some -LRB- but not all -RRB- other provinces , and it does not consider the very real possibility that an increase in tuition fees will lead to an even lower rate in Quebec .<-->O
Opponents of the Quebec student movement also claim that the participation rate of less wealthy students is no different in high tuition fee jurisidictions than in Quebec .<-->O
Since it is in fact impossible to determine by appealing to statistics the exact relationship between tuition fee levels and accessibility , I do not in this article base my arguments for free post-secondary education on the matter of accessibility , except to point out the obvious fact that it easier for a young person from a rich family than a young person from a poor family to pay for an expensive education , Why have tuition fees ?<-->O
The strongest argument in favour of tuition fees is that university graduates have subststantially higher incomes than non-university graduates .<-->N
They should not therefore expect their studies to be totally subsidized from general tax revenue to which non-graduates as well as well as graduates must contribute .<-->O
This argument could be applied to any level of education , since high school graduates have on average higher incomes than those who have completed only elementary school .<-->O
The argument raises two questions .<-->N
The first is : from the perspective of the well-being of society as a whole , should education be considered a privately purchased consumer product or a public good provided to all qualified members of society by the community ?<-->O
The second , closely related question -LRB- closely related because there is already a social consensus that , with respect to elementary and secondary education , the answer to the first question is `` a public good '' and not `` a consumer product '' -RRB- is this : in today 's society , given the educational requirements needed for the functioning of the society 's organizations and institutions , what is the highest level of study that should reasonably be considered to fall within the range of levels that citizens are expected to attain as part of their basic education ?<-->O
These two questions can in fact be reduced to one : is the post-secondary education of a significant portion of the citizenry sufficiently important for the functioning of society today to be considered a public and not a private good ?<-->O
In these remarks I argue that it is .<-->N
An even less convincing argument for costly university tuition is that students and graduates do not value their studies unless they are expensive .<-->O
Defending the tuition fee increases in Quebec , the provost at that time of Concordia University was quoted in the Montreal Gazette -LRB- March 8 , 2012 -RRB- as saying : `` I seriously worry that by offering things cheaply you inadvertently create the idea they have little worth .<-->O
It is vital for people to value the education they receive . ''<-->N
This line of reasoning appears to confirm , unintentionally , of course , Karl Marx 's concept of what is now called the `` commodification '' of human relations , the idea that capitalism contaminates every aspect of human life by reducing it to its monetary exchange value .<-->O
However most people still believe that many things in life , indeed the most important and valued things like love , respect , honesty , and the like , can not be purchased and that their value can not be measured in dollars and cents .<-->O
This can be said as well for public services provided by the whole community for the benefit of all its members .<-->N
Concerning the last point , one argument for tuition fees I have heard from a university administrator is that `` in the end , someone has to foot the bill , '' and that in Canada today , provincial governments pay about 80 % of this bill and students only 20 % .<-->N
It is not obvious , this administrator continued , `` that taxpayers should simply pick up the remaining 20 % . ''<-->O
-LRB- Parenthetically , I might note that the student fee component of a university 's income is sometimes incorrectly formulated with the claim that students pay only 20 % of the cost of their education .<-->O
However the 20 % figure is calculated as a proportion of the total budget , whereas a not insignificant portion of a university 's budget is allocated to many activities not involving the instruction of students , such as faculty research , staff travel , advertising and `` celebration of accomplishments '' , expansion of non-teaching administrative positions , high levels of senior executive remuneration and perquisites , etc. -RRB- .<-->O
In fact , in many Canadian universities today governments contribute to less than half of their costs , and in Ontario , for example , officials speak not of `` public universities '' but of `` publicly-assisted '' universities .<-->N
Saying that everything has a cost is of course true of any public service , whether it is CBC radio , streets and highways , garbage collection , snow-clearing , food safety protection , medical care , the police , high school education , etc. .<-->O
I would rephrase the question so as to ask not who is the someone who should pay , but what sectors of human activity should be funded by the collectivity because they serve the collective good or constitute protection against collective risk ?<-->O
Public universities should be free Public education should be free .<-->O
If it is n't free , it is n't public education .<-->N
This should not be a controversial assertion .<-->N
This should be common sense .<-->N
But Americans have forgotten what the `` public '' in `` public education '' actually means -LRB- or used to mean -RRB- .<-->O
The problem is that the word no longer has anything to refer to : This country 's public universities have been radically transformed .<-->N
The change has happened so slowly and so gradually bit by bit , cut by cut over half a century that it can be seen really only in retrospect .<-->O
But with just a small amount of historical perspective , the change is dramatic : public universities that once charged themselves to open their doors to all who could benefit by attending that were , by definition , the public property of the entire state have become something entirely different .<-->O
What we still call public universities would be more accurately described as state-controlled private universities corporate entities that think and behave like businesses .<-->O
Whereas there once was a public mission to educate the republic 's citizens , there is now the goal of satisfying the educational needs of the market , aided by PR departments that brand degrees as commodities and build consumer interest , always with an eye to the bottom line .<-->O
And while public universities once sought to advance the industry of the state as a whole , with an eye to the common good , shortfalls in public funding have led to universities ' treating their research capacity as a source of primary fundraising , developing new technologies and products for the private sector , explicitly to raise the money they need to operate .<-->O
Conflicts of interest are now commonplace .<-->N
Should public universities be free ?<-->N
Only because our public universities have been so fundamentally privatized over the last 40 years does the sentence `` Public universities should be free '' even make sense .<-->O
Of course they should be free !<-->N
If an education is available only to those who can afford it if an education is a commodity to be purchased in the marketplace in what sense can it really be called public ?<-->O
Let there be light In the early 1960s , California formulated a master plan for higher education a single name for a set of interlocking policies developed by University of California president Clark Kerr .<-->N
The idea was that any Californian who wanted a postsecondary education would have a place to go in the state 's three-tiered system .<-->N
Students could go to a community college for free , and from there they could transfer to a California State University or a University of California where no tuition was charged , only course fees that were intended to be nominal .<-->O
New universities were swiftly planned and built to meet the dramatic increase in demand expected from baby boomers and the state 's growing population ; as more and more citizens aspired to higher education , California opened more and more classrooms and universities to give them that opportunity .<-->O
The master plan was not a blank check , but it was a commitment : any Californian who wanted a postsecondary education could get one .<-->O
Today that is simply not true .<-->N
For one thing , institutions like the University of California have not grown to meet the rising demand ; year by year , bit by bit , as the state 's population has continued to grow , a larger percentage of California students have been turned away or replaced by out-of-state students -LRB- who pay much higher tuition -RRB- .<-->O
In fact , university officials are quite explicit about the fact that they are admitting more out-of-state and international students -LRB- and fewer Californians -RRB- in order to raise money .<-->O
Historically , about 10 percent of the U.C. 's student population was from out of state , but that number has more than doubled since the 2008 financial crisis .<-->N
-LRB- In Michigan , which has been hit even harder than California , out-of-state enrollment in the University of Michigan system is closer to 40 percent . -RRB-<-->N
Most important , as tuition steadily rises to the level of comparable private universities , the word `` public '' comes to mean less and less .<-->O
Indeed , when Mark Yudof was appointed president of the University of California in 2008 , he was known as an advocate of what he had called in 2002 the hybrid university : an institution that retained some of the characteristics of a public university but would draw the bulk of its revenue from student tuition .<-->N
Yudof 's vision of the `` public '' university would have been unrecognizable to the architects of the master plan : instead of providing the tools for the state 's citizens to better themselves , state universities are to survive by thinking like a business , selling their product for as much as the market will bear .<-->O
From the point of view of higher-education consumers which are what its students have effectively become the claim that the U.C. system is public rings increasingly false with every passing year .<-->O
For my parents , by contrast , distinction between public and private was very clear .<-->O
Both baby boomers and the first in their families to get college degrees , they went to public universities because they were affordable and private universities were not .<-->N
By that definition , are there any public universities left ?<-->N
Schools that are at least partially funded and controlled by elected officials , usually at the state level , are nominally public , and the broad range of universities that are not owned by the government from nonprofit corporations like Harvard to explicitly for-profit corporations like the University of Phoenix or Udacity truly inhabit the private sector .<-->O
But if the price tag is the same , if the product is the same and if the experience is the same , what difference does a university 's tax status make ?<-->N
A university that thinks and behaves like a private-sector corporation charging its consumers what the market will bear , cutting costs wherever it can and using competition with its peers as its measure of success is a public university in name only .<-->O
Open roads and toll roads A better way to compare public and private would be to consider the difference between public roads and toll roads .<-->O
Some toll roads are owned and operated by state governments and some by the private sector .<-->N
But does the driver care who owns the road ?<-->N
I doubt it ; the important thing is whether the road is free and open to all or whether it can be used only by those who can afford to drive on it .<-->O
The same is true of public and private universities : A university is public only if those who need to use it can do so .<-->O
In this sense , it seems to me that the malaise that afflicts our public universities is not really about about dollars and cents .<-->O
If this country can build the world 's largest military and fight open-ended wars in multiple theaters across the globe , it can find a way to pay for public education , as it once did in living memory .<-->N
But doing so has ceased to be a real priority .<-->N
Affordable public education is no longer something we expect , demand or take for granted ; to argue that public education should be free makes you sound like an absurd and unrealistic utopian .<-->O
Meanwhile , we take it for granted that roads should be free to drive on , a toll road here or there not withstanding .<-->O
You provide the car and the gas ; the state provides the road .<-->N
This used to be how we thought about our public universities , before they became exorbitant toll roads .<-->O
If you had the grades and the ambition , there was a classroom open to you .<-->N
But if every road were a toll road , no one would expect to drive for free .<-->O
If every road were a toll road , the very idea that the government would build and maintain a massive system of roads and highways and then let anyone use it -LRB- for free ! -RRB-<-->O
would seem fantastical , ridiculous , even perverse .<-->O
People expecting the right to drive anywhere they pleased , for free , would be branded utopian , socialist and deluded , soft-hearted liberals demanding a free lunch .<-->O
That 's the world we live in when it comes to highways .<-->N
When the roads that drive our economy and make modern life possible get too crowded or too congested , we expect the state to build new roads .<-->O
When the old roads wear out , they are repaved .<-->N
When a tree or a landslide obstructs a thoroughfare , the state clears the way .<-->N
When there are not enough classrooms , on the other hand , the state no longer builds new universities ; it simply charges more .<-->N
For most of the 20th century , when the overwhelming majority of this country 's public universities were built , it was simply common sense that a growing college-age population had to be matched by a growing system of accessible higher education , something that as everyone agreed only the government could provide and that only the government did provide .<-->O
They were explicitly chartered to bring a college degree within the reach of as many citizens as possible and to advance the greater good by disseminating knowledge as widely as possible .<-->O
Without that common sense , that bipartisan consensus , our public universities would never have been built in the first place .<-->O
And judged by that original standard , there are few , if any , public universities left .<-->N
Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free How to Decrease Cost and Increase Quality at American Universities Description Universities tend to be judged by the test scores of their incoming students and not on what students actually learn once they attend these institutions .<-->N
While shared tests and surveys have been developed , most schools refuse to publish the results .<-->N
Instead , they allow such publications as U.S. News & World Report to define educational quality .<-->O
In order to raise their status in these rankings , institutions pour money into new facilities and extracurricular activities while underfunding their educational programs .<-->N
In Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free , Robert Samuels argues that many institutions of higher education squander funds and mislead the public about such things as average class size , faculty-to-student ratios , number of faculty with PhDs , and other indicators of educational quality .<-->O
Parents and students seem to have little knowledge of how colleges and universities have been restructured over the past thirty years .<-->O
Samuels shows how research universities have begun to function as giant investment banks or hedge funds that spend money on athletics and administration while increasing tuition costs and actually lowering the quality of undergraduate education .<-->O
In order to fight higher costs and lower quality , Samuels suggests , universities must reallocate these misused funds and concentrate on their core mission of instruction and related research .<-->N
Throughout the book , Samuels argues that the future of our economy and democracy rests on our ability to train students to be thoughtful participants in the production and analysis of knowledge .<-->O
If leading universities serve only to grant credentials and prestige , our society will suffer irrevocable harm .<-->O
Presenting the problem of how universities make and spend money , Samuels provides solutions to make these important institutions less expensive and more vital .<-->O
By using current resources in a more effective manner , we could even , he contends , make all public higher education free .<-->O
Praise `` Samuels 's argument is a persuasive and informative introduction to the higher education industry . ''<-->O
Publishers Weekly `` Adding his voice to a growing chorus of critiques of the state of higher education , Samuels , a prolific blogger on the subject of higher education , seeks to convince his readers of the disconnect between the cost of tuition and the quality of instruction and , furthermore , that a high-quality combination of research and instruction could be maintained without the need for tuition at all .<-->O
He explains how a large portion of tuition dollars go toward administration costs , research , noneducational programs -LRB- e.g. , athletics , recreational extras , etc. , and technology . -RRB-<-->N
Samuels also points out that many universities are making risky investments and borrowing large sums to fund construction of new facilities that do not necessarily enhance learning and to increase compensation to already highly paid faculty and administrators .<-->O
He argues that if current government funding to higher education were used more effectively , public institutions could be tuition free .<-->O
Samuels presents a thought-provoking case for reform , and his book will appeal to anyone concerned with the current and/or future state of higher education in the United States . ''<-->O
Library Journal `` The important message of Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free is that the solutions to current problems of higher education can not be achieved ... until institutional priorities change . ''<-->N
Academe `` Bracing and incisive , Samuels offers that rare call to arms that speaks simultaneously to faculty , students , parents , and administrators . ''<-->N
Marc Bousquet , author of How the University Works `` In this important and timely book , Samuels makes a powerful case for fundamental reforms in higher education that are critical not only for the future of the American university but also for the future of our nation and the world at large .

Making All Public Higher Education Free 10 .<-->F
Educating Students for a Multicultural Democracy Notes Works Cited Index 11 .<-->N
Do the Math : Free Public Higher Education Should be Considered The notion of free public higher education might elicit scoffs upon initial suggestion , but given the soaring student loan debts , the idea is one that begs further investigation .<-->O
Student loan debt hit the $ 1 trillion mark last year , helping it retain its place as the fastest growing consumer debt , and what 's more , about 11.5 percent of student loan balances are more than 90 days delinquent or in default , according to a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .<-->N
Research on the true costs of making all public higher education free in the U.S. , such as that detailed in a working paper from the Campaign for the Future of Higher Education , points to the fact that while demand might rise if public higher ed were free , the cost of providing it actually is smaller than many would think .<-->O
Consider the math .<-->N
In 2009-10 , the average cost of tuition , room and board for undergraduates at public four-year institutions was $ 14,870 , and $ 7,629 for two-year public colleges .<-->F
When you multiply the number of students in each segment by the average total cost , it amounts to a price tag of $ 127 billion for free public higher ed .<-->N
But consider this : that same year , the federal government spent $ 35 billion on Pell grants and $ 104 billion on student loans , with states spending at least $ 10 billion on financial aid for universities and colleges and another $ 80 billion for direct support of higher education , the research shows .<-->O
As Bob Samuels , lecturer at UCLA and President of University of California 's American Federation of Teachers , points out in `` Making All Public Higher Education Free '' : By eliminating the need for student loans , the federal government would also save billions of dollars due to the current cost of non-payment , servicing , subsidization , and defaults that could be directly applied to providing free public higher education .<-->O
Compounding the problem is the fact that instead of directly funding public higher education to cover the costs , the government has relied on tax deductions and credits to individual students .<-->N
While the system has provided a bevy of subsidies to upper-middle-class and wealthy families , it leaves lower-income students scrambling for massive loans .<-->N
The tax subsidies , breaks and credits also add up in terms of lost revenue for the federal government .<-->N
In 2010 alone , nearly $ 40 billion in tax revenue that could have gone to higher education was lost , the research shows .<-->N
State governments also lose billions of dollars in tax revenue each year due to the 529 College Savings Plans , due to wealthy families having figured out that they can use them as all-purpose tax shelters .<-->N
So as states lose revenue and are forced to cut higher ed budgets , the rich are able to shield more of their earnings using this mechanism .<-->O
The bottom line is fairly simple , yet one that must be examined thoroughly and critically -- if state and federal funding already being spent , and lost , on higher education were re-appropriated , the possibility of making public higher education free for millions of Americans becomes a distinct reality .<-->O
Debate on the rise of the internet , does it do more harm or good ?<-->N
This is the third debate between myself and @politiwhat .<-->N
Make sure you check out @politiwhat s side of the debate here to see what he has to say : http://politiwhatblog.tumblr.com/ If you want to get involved check out @political_ppl on twitter I d be delighted to hear from you .<-->O
Let s begin .<-->N
Does the internet do more harm than good ?<-->N
Absolutely not .<-->N
I believe it does more good than harm .<-->O
The internet is the most powerful tool society has ever experienced .<-->O
I agree that embracing the power of the internet is difficult for some .<-->O
This is mainly due to individualism .<-->N
The internet is something different to each individual .<-->N
I believe it is up to the individual what they make of the internet .<-->N
I do accept the fact that some people misuse it and in a rare minority of cases it may bring harm to an individual s life .<-->O
But good readers we must look at the bigger picture .<-->O
When used properly which it is by the 99 % then the possibilities are endless .<-->N
I will be discussing two main points today : 1 .<-->N
The champions people s rights - particularly the freedom of speech 2 .<-->O
How the internet has led to the spread of new ideas and information .<-->N
So to my first point , our constitution recognises and declares that people living in Ireland have certain fundamental personal rights .<-->O
One of these is the freedom of speech .<-->N
This continues onto the internet in the form of something known as the freedom of expression .<-->N
Before the rise of the internet people still had the right but they had no medium whatsoever to express their opinions on a large scale .<-->O
People were left without a voice .<-->N
Fundamentally the internet champions people s rights .<-->N
It gives them a medium to express their views and opinions .<-->O
Would I be talking to you right now my good readers if it weren t for the internet ?<-->O
Many different individuals from all different parts of society expressing different views is good for democracy .<-->N
The freedom of expression can be used as a political tool .<-->N
This puts pressure on members of government which adds to the democratic structure of society .<-->N
The internet promotes equality .<-->N
It shows us through digital means that we have an equal voice when compared to those in power .<-->N
The internet has broken down barriers which previously existed between political figures and society .<-->N
Now here s the issue which I have highlighted - not everybody in society will agree on certain topics online .<-->O
But I see no harm in lively debate .<-->O
A mixture of views is great as it gives a better conclusion of a matter .<-->O
I also accept - there will be people that abuse the freedom of speech on the internet .<-->O
The most recent example of this would be ISIS Yes , we agree that they brought harm to the internet by posting racist videos online .<-->O
However , good will always prevail .<-->N
When ISIS moved online it became a global matter .<-->N
It united the internet .<-->N
We saw the great side of the internet - the one which promotes rights , the one which saves lives .<-->N
I believe that when defeating flawed views the only civilized way to do so is through meaningful discussion and debate .<-->O
The internet and the freedom of speech combined promotes activism .<-->N
Something which when used within the boundaries can be hugely beneficial .<-->N
For example Edwards Snowden s Wikileaks campaign .<-->N
Would that ever have happened if he ran outside and started screaming , the US government is spying on you and invading your privacy !<-->N
Certainly not .<-->N
Edward used the internet as a platform to bring down a corrupt part of society .<-->N
So to my second point - the spread of knowledge as a result of the web .<-->N
The internet is the best possible source of information you will ever find .<-->O
But information does more than aforementioned .<-->N
Similar to when Guttenburg invented the printing press ideas are spreading like wild fire as a result of the internet .<-->O
The internet has led to the spread of knowledge and information from country to country .<-->N
It has been at the forefront of globalization .<-->N
It has led to the Age of Information or The Enlightenment 2.0 .<-->N
In the developing world the old proverb is certainly active educate one person then you are educating the village .<-->N
As the developing world become more educated it breaks down boundaries and leads to a more equal world .<-->N
A new landscape of political and societal change has been brought about as a result of the internet .<-->N
We all have equal access to knowledge on the internet .<-->N
No one is given preference or bias .<-->O
The term global village when used to describe the world we live in has become very accurate as a result of the internet .<-->O
We have become more and more interdependent in all aspects .<-->N
Online political social movements have become increasingly common since the internet .<-->N
Most notably the Arab revolutions against dictatorships and the protests against multi national companies for fair wages for workers .<-->O
The internet is pro-democracy .<-->N
It has led to the democratization of many countries .<-->N
Such changes must be positive .<-->N
Inspiring bloggers and activists on the internet have spread such good ideologies and morals throughout the world that surely the internet does more good than harm .<-->O
In conclusion , I accept the flaws of the internet but believe it brings about much more good than harm .<-->O
The advantages far outweigh the disadvantages and for this reason I believe my arguments are justified .<-->O
Thanks for reading .<-->N

-------------------- The Internet May Be Causing More Harm to Your Children Than You Think By Leslie Davis It used to be that your teens would go online only to research an assignment or play a game .<-->N
These days , your teens are practically attached to their computers , checking Facebook , adding music to their iPods and streaming YouTube clips .<-->N
Even if they have friends over , it 's not uncommon to see all of them huddled around the computer doing something online .<-->N
You 've probably heard that increased Internet use is associated with poor eating habits , lessened physical activity and behavioral issues .<-->N
A new study published in the journal Injury Prevention shows that Internet addiction can also lead teens to cause themselves harm through pulling their own hair or hitting , pinching or burning themselves .<-->N
A survey of more than 1,600 teenagers in China found that teens who were moderately addicted to the Internet were 2.4 times more likely to have self-injured themselves in the past six months than those with normal Internet habits .<-->N
Teens who were severely addicted to the Internet were nearly five times as likely to injure themselves .<-->O
Though self-injurious behavior can be attributed to many different factors , such as depression , stressful life events or family problems , the study found that Internet addiction on its own can lead to teens harming themselves .<-->O
Recognizing Signs of Internet Addiction An Internet addiction is classified the same as other addictions , such as those to drugs , alcohol or gambling .<-->N
If your teen simply goes on the Internet frequently , it is unlikely you have anything to worry about .<-->O
But if your teen is exhibiting any of the following signs of an Internet addiction , you may want to take action : Excessive time spent devoted to using the Internet Depression , moodiness or nervousness when not online Fantasizing about or being preoccupied with being online A change in sleeping patterns or habits Sudden weight loss or weight gain Lying about time spent on the Internet or denying use Neglecting family , friends or activities they used to enjoy Using the Internet to avoid problems Internet addicts can also experience physical symptoms such as dry eyes , backaches , migraine headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome .<-->O
What to Do if Your Teen Has an Internet Addiction If you are concerned that your teen does have an Internet addiction , especially if they are causing self-harm , there are some things you can do : Limit time spent online .<-->O
With unlimited access to the Internet 24 hours a day , stopping an addiction is nearly impossible .<-->O
Set limits on the amount of time your teen is allowed to go online .<-->N
If necessary , log them on and off the computer so that you make sure the time limits are followed .<-->O
Take the computer out of their rooms .<-->N
If your teen has a computer in their bedroom , it 's easy for them to get online when you 're not around .<-->N
Move the computer to a shared room so that you can see how much time they are spending online and better monitor their habits .<-->O
Ask them about it .<-->N
Though there 's a good chance your teen will deny having an Internet addiction , and may not even be aware they have one , ask them about it .<-->O
Find out why they are going online and what their Internet habits are to help determine if there is an addiction to be broken .<-->N
Get them help .<-->N
Much like any other addiction , an Internet addiction likely requires professional treatment .<-->O
Therapy can help your teen address the addiction , any underlying issues causing the addiction and issues related to self-injury .<-->O
If outpatient therapy is not enough to break your teen 's addiction , you may want to seek help through a residential treatment center or therapeutic boarding school , where your teen will have a supportive environment in which to break their addiction and learn healthy coping mechanisms .<-->O
Do n't think that your teen 's Internet addiction will just go away on its own .<-->O
With the increasing use of the Internet in every facet of life , your teen will need to learn to have a healthy relationship with the computer .<-->O
And if an Internet addiction is causing your teen to injure themselves , taking steps now can help them better learn to manage any stress or anxiety that is causing them to do so .<-->O
------------ 6 Ways Social Media Is Doing More Harm Than Good In the next 10 years , social media as we know will go the way of the 8-track tape , disposable camera , and fax machine .<-->O
And I ca n't say that I 'm sad .<-->N
It 's not that I do n't enjoy interacting with online friends -- or that businesses have n't made a valiant effort to listen to their customers online .<-->O
But here 's the thing : Every morning , my eyes pop open with the thought , `` I need to post . ''<-->O
Not I need to eat , call home , pray -- but post .<-->O
The experts tell me it has to be done no later than 8:00 Eastern time , preferably earlier .<-->N
My second thought is , `` Post what ?<-->N
What words of wisdom do I have today ? ''<-->N
If I come up short , then I hope my wise friends are up earlier and have written a spectacular post that day that I can `` share . ''<-->O
Then of course , there are the related tasks : writing weekly blogs and guest blogs , doing BlogTalkRadio interviews , planning online book tours , participating in affiliate book launches , responding to reporters ' questions online , catching up with what 's trending on Twitter , retweeting my friends ' tweets , circling over to LinkedIn to check messages and my group discussions , responding to all the `` Like '' requests , sharing some fascinating article from HuffPost , HBR , or Forbes with a witty lead-in on Google Plus , then checking Facebook notifications to see who said what about whom .<-->O
Do I really have this kind of time ?<-->O
But if I disappear from this scene for a couple of weeks , people start emailing to ask if I 've died .<-->N
So I keep posting , sharing , tweeting , and liking .<-->N
But it has to stop .<-->N
It 's stressful .<-->N
People have become tired of being connected 24/7 , of being expected to be available to respond to an email at a sporting event on Friday night , at commenting on an angry post on Sunday morning , at arranging a conference call while sitting in the dentist office at 7:30 a.m. getting a cavity filled , at retweeting the boss 's PR messages during the holidays .<-->O
It reduces productivity .<-->N
Spending an hour a day on social media amounts to nine weeks a year !<-->F
Nine weeks !<-->N
That 's enough to complete a couple of college courses .<-->N
Some people spend twice that amount of time on social media .<-->N
Think what they could create , build , give , or learn with that time .<-->N
It costs money -- and it going to start costing much more as sites find new ways to monetize .<-->N
All the social media sites started out free to users .<-->N
Now that users have been enticed and hooked , Facebook has started to monetize its business pages .<-->F
LinkedIn also has an upgraded plan .<-->N
Before long , all will be charging except for the very basic features .<-->O
In addition to the monetization by the social media sites -LRB- who can blame them ; every business needs to make money -RRB- , many individuals and businesses now even hire marketing teams to `` participate '' for them online .<-->O
That is , the marketing team posts and responds for them online and becomes their online `` presence '' -- another cost of social media .<-->N
This is not to mention those sites that even extort money from businesses to remove bad reviews from complaining customers -LRB- sometimes even up to $ 100k ! -RRB-<-->O
without allowing the business to respond to the complainer .<-->N
It has become noise and clutter , not communication .<-->N
Individuals and small businesses used to say that the internet and social media leveled the playing field -- that they could occasionally toss in a mention about their product or service on their personal pages or blog and no one would mind .<-->O
But now , everyone uses social media for that purpose .<-->N
Every day , you get messages about free webinars , free teleseminars , free BlogTalkRadio shows , free reports , free white papers , and free downloadable ebooks .<-->O
People beg you to take their giveaways .<-->N
It 's all noise and clutter .<-->N
It reduces creativity .<-->N
Thinking creatively with all the social media noise around you is the equivalent of writing a dissertation in the middle of speeding traffic on a super highway .<-->N
You may get the stimulation of new ideas , but executing them becomes another matter .<-->N
It 's no longer real .<-->N
Do you really have 87,000 `` followers '' on Twitter who respond when you suggest they take action ?<-->N
Do you even have 500 close `` connections '' on LinkedIn who would take your call tomorrow ?<-->O
How many of your 18,237 `` friends '' on Facebook would recognize your name if they saw it on a billboard ?<-->N
Do n't get me wrong : I 'm a social person .<-->N
It 's just that social media is fast evolving into a cacophony that drowns out communication and drains productivity .<-->O
What 's your take on the situation ?<-->N

The Internet Brings More Harm Than Good Internet users beware !<-->F
How many hours do you spend in the internet each day ?<-->F
The internet is a network connecting computers around the world .<-->F
The creation of the World Wide Web and the Web browsers gave the ordinary people easy ways of getting around the internet - young or old , boy or girl , student or professional , working or unemployed and .<-->F
husband or wife .<-->N
Some people believe that the internet is useful in everyday life .<-->N
In a busy world , people use internet for their business transactions , for research and for shopping .<-->N
But the following reasons show the arguments that the use of the internet brings more harm than good .<-->O
First , the quality of information online can not always be relied upon .<-->N
The information has not gone through the same checks as the newspaper articles , books or factual television programming .<-->N
There is a higher risk that some facts or quotations from a particular source in an article are false .<-->O
A blog or other online content can be easily created or uploaded as well as deleted .<-->O
If people base their opinions on the information they find online , they could be basing their opinion on false information .<-->O
Second , the internet is a threat to privacy .<-->N
The temptations for criminals to gain private information becomes greater .<-->N
Hackers can hide their true location when engaging in illegal activities online .<-->O
When people start to post information online , it is almost impossible to erase and with the proliferation of social networks posting personal information online is becoming second nature , this is a dangerous precedent .<-->O
Personal information can be looked into and copied for illegal purposes .<-->N
Third , the internet has allowed a large amount of criminal , offensive or discriminatory information to be accessed .<-->O
Researches and studies have shown that terrorists have utilized the use of the internet to the detriment of the society .<-->N
Some psychologists believed that there is a causal link between internet porn and rise in sex offenses .<-->N
Likewise , reports have shown the rise images of child pornography on the internet and more pedophiles have been arrested with a lot of lewd photos or images The opponents might say that the internet gives more benefits than harm .<-->O
They believed that internet is useful because it provides them with information news and latest developments around the world .<-->N
Access to information can be faster and convenient , yet , it can not deny the fact that there are abuses in the use of the internet .<-->O
People can fabricate information and the public has no way of knowing which one is false and which one is accurate .<-->O
Accessiblity to the internet opens the opportunity for the commission of crimes and for evil to triumph .<-->O
In conclusion , people may not be aware of the harmful effects of the use of internet .<-->O
The false information may be adopted without realizing that it can not be relied upon .<-->N
No person is guaranteed of privacy when using the internet because some website stores information that it gathers from the users .<-->N
Internet , likewise , leads to the commission of criminal acts and offensive and discriminatory behaviours like pornography and other sex offenses .<-->O

The Internet Is Doing You More Harm Than Good Imagine it s the year 1800 and you wanted to share a political idea with the public .<-->N
How would you do so ?<-->N
You would gather enough funds to publish a pamphlet that you would distribute in social clubs or other gathering centers .<-->O
You would only be able to do this if you were of means or had financial backing .<-->N
Things are different today .<-->N
With a basic internet connection that can be obtained for free or at trivial cost , you can use one of many online platforms such as WordPress , Twitter , Tumblr , and Facebook to publish ideas and thoughts .<-->O
While the cost of publishing a second pamphlet is near the same as the first , the cost of publishing a second blog post or Twitter update is zero .<-->N
The internet has solved the cost barrier to idea distribution where a larger percentage of the population can share ideas that has the potential to reach people throughout the world .<-->N
This ability , upon closer inspection , is actually causing us harm .<-->O
We would all better off limiting our internet usage than expanding it further .<-->O
An Unlimited Potential Supply Of Information Because the cost of sharing is zero , we now have a drastically increased supply of information that is being shared .<-->N
Someone today who would have never published a pamphlet in the past now has published 1,000 Facebook status updates , 10,000 Twitter updates , and 50 Tumblr entries .<-->N
He even wrote one Tumblr post about how stupid horses are that went viral among horse riders and got him receiving 250 comments in one day .<-->N
Such a diatribe against horses would not have been published in the past by someone who didn t know horses , but now there is a mechanism for creating , finding , and sharing such inconsequential content that can emotionally affect those who read them .<-->O
The content you read now has moved from being primarily intellectual from the time of the Gutenberg press to primarily emotional .<-->O
In the past , it was just too expensive to publish something with the intent to piss someone off or to gather lulz .<-->O
Like with the first viral article in history -LRB- Martin Luther s 95 Theses -RRB- , you went through the hurdle and cost of publishing to educate or effect change .<-->N
Only with the the beginnings of yellow journalism in the late 19th century did you start to see a shift towards more emotional offerings that would enrich publishers and advertisers at the expense of public discourse .<-->O
Fast forward to today .<-->N
We re bombarded with poorly written and braindead pieces of content that are engineered to go viral for the sake of virality , not to educate and improve the individual or society .<-->O
Thousands of media outlets , professional bloggers , and vacuous attention whores and dumping an unfathomable amount of content onto the internet every day , playing the numbers game in the hopes that they will get clicks .<-->O
There used to be a dearth of reading material for humans but now there is too much , and we are wasting time on content that we shouldn t just to be entertained , just to feel a little emotional rush that we may not be getting through our normal lives .<-->O
Consider that people now purposefully read content they hate just to stir their emotions .<-->O
They do this as part of their daily routine .<-->N
Enter The Validation Machine The scenario I painted gets even worse when you add to it the validation machine that the internet offers .<-->N
If you published 5,000 copies of a pamphlet , how would you know that your message reached the masses ?<-->N
You would receive letters and individuals would make a call to your dwelling or office to discuss what you wrote .<-->N
But today , the response can be instant and massive .<-->N
A witty tweet you publish right now can have replies coming in within seconds .<-->O
A basic photo you upload on Facebook or Instagram can have likes pouring it from your admirers .<-->N
A blog post you wrote can have comments and shares within an hour or two .<-->N
You can even check traffic to your blog live with Google Analytics , as it happens .<-->N
Since it s never certain how your content will be received , every time you hit Submit you pull the handle on the slot machine .<-->O
Will this tweet hit the jackpot and get more than 100 retweets , maybe even from someone famous ?<-->O
Will this blog post receive more than 50,000 page views ?<-->N
For human beings , this sort of randomized personal validation rivals the strength of any narcotic drug .<-->N
You begin sharing not to share information , but to receive attention .<-->N
In other words , if we were no longer allowed to know how our content was received -LRB- in effect throwing it from airplanes onto the masses below -RRB- , the amount of internet content shared would plummet .<-->O
User-generated content would fade .<-->O
Even people who share silly comments on blogs do so in the hopes of getting replies and upvotes .<-->O
There is also the addiction to sharing itself , which rivals the addiction to receiving attention .<-->N
It used to be the case that you would read an article , think about it , and then move on with your day .<-->O
But now , before your brain has even processed the contents , you re blasting it on your social networks .<-->N
Raise your hand if you ve shared something you haven t completely read .<-->N
My hand is up .<-->N
We monitor how often our share was re-shared in the hopes that our social worth goes up , all from a mediocre article that was likely a list post with images or animated gifs .<-->O
We peruse the internet not to find information we need , but to share information we think others will like so that we feel good about ourselves .<-->O
The internet has become a machine to fill gaps in your ego and self-esteem so that you receive the emotional benefits of validation .<-->O
This occurs through compulsive checking of responses to your content and shares in the hope of receiving a neurotransmitter release in your brain so that you can transcend the feeling of living life like a standard issue modern sheep , something the majority of human beings will never escape .<-->O
Any emotional response you receive gives you both purpose and distraction to your stale and monotonous life .<-->O
How I Responded To My Growing Internet Addiction At the start of this year , when I had a temporary lull in work , I found myself engaged in a loop of checking email , Twitter , Facebook , blogs , and so on .<-->N
Even though it had been less than an hour since I last checked my email , I checked it again , and again , hoping for something new .<-->N
I dropped a tweet and checked five minutes later to see if there was a response .<-->N
I engaged this behavior without thought .<-->N
More severely , I had trouble stopping .<-->O
Hours of my day would go by without accomplishing anything but this validation loop .<-->N
I like to think of myself as a productive individual who has put out a decent amount of work , so I wondered if I couldn t stop myself from this addiction , how could my little brother ?<-->O
How can young guys coming up in life resist it ?<-->N
I don t think they can , because Twitter , Facebook , and sites like it are engineered like drugs .<-->O
When you log into Twitter , the first thing you see is a metric of your worth -LRB- number of followers -RRB- , which you hope to see increase .<-->O
You are also prompted with a box that urges you to share not an intellectual or useful piece of information , but crap .<-->N
You share crap and then read other people s crap , retweeting the crap you think your followers will like .<-->O
Once your crap is retweeted and replied , you receive a fleeting shot of dopamine .<-->N
But that dies down quickly so you need to check for more content .<-->O
You stumble on an article that enrages you , even though it s similar to the crap you shared last week , and then share that too .<-->O
It s a neverending cycle of sharing crap and reading crap that other people are sharing directly to you , hoping that you will spread their crap far and wide .<-->N
In Instagram the race is to share crappy photos .<-->N
On Facebook the race is to share both crappy photos and thoughts -LRB- double crap ! -RRB- .<-->F
More than 99 % of blog postings on the internet are crap .<-->N
Even in my Twitter feed , where I followed less than 100 men , I was being exposed to mostly mediocre content that was re-hashed crap .<-->O
Everyone is sharing crap to get personal validation , so when I noticed the other month that I had shared 11,000 tweets of crap , I felt ashamed .<-->O
By far , most of the tweets I shared were news stories meant to emotionally arouse men , offering them little in the way of personal development , because such development is hard and takes years , but getting a soma boost from reading about the latest feminist antics is sweet like candy and requires nothing but a few minutes of your time .<-->O
I can only imagine how tired our brains get because of the roller coaster we put it through when browsing through the internet .<-->O
When you look at the tremendous popularity of Vine and Buzzfeed , which use facile images , videos , and ideas to entertain its audiences , you can see how the internet is nothing more than interactive television .<-->O
For those of you who used it in its early days , when it was just mostly text , I m sure you will agree with me that the internet has turned into something grotesque .<-->O
Only through strenuous amounts of self-control and constant vigilance can you escape its negative effects to use it as it was intended a tool for knowledge , education , and communication not a means of feeling important or better about yourself .<-->O
I have challenged myself to exhibit self-control by making some changes .<-->N
I only check my email once a day , just like I would check postal mail once a day .<-->O
If I have to read an old email or send a new one , I do not look at the fresh emails waiting for me .<-->N
I will share value through my blog that I believe helps human beings .<-->O
I will avoid publishing emotional clickbait that feeds my ego or wanting to be popular .<-->O
I will not anger men unnecessarily .<-->O
I will use Twitter and Facebook as functional tools to promote my work , not as a way to get instant attention that releases brain neurotransmitters .<-->N
I will not go hunting for content .<-->O
Instead , I will use RSS feeds to only read a small list of trusted blogs .<-->N
I will resist articles that are being widely shared , because its value will most likely lie in the emotional than the intellectual .<-->O
A truly intellectual piece should by its nature not appeal to a larger audience .<-->O
I will not use the internet on my smartphone unless it s looking up directions or language translations .<-->N
I uninstalled apps like Twitter , Facebook , and Gmail .<-->N
Through these changes , I can now admit that the internet had become like a surrogate friend to me , smoothing out the natural lows of life with instant validation at essentially free cost .<-->O
I often found myself in between tasks for the day , wanting an emotional burst before continuing .<-->N
Instead of reaching out to be validated by the internet , I now sit silently and let my brain go where it wants , until it s internally motivated to tackle the next task .<-->N
Since doing this , my thoughts have more clear and ideas for articles such as this one has been more forthcoming .<-->N
I look around at people staring like zombies into their phones and realize how they are in a race to absorb as much information as possible in the hope of receiving emotional stimulation from digesting someone else s work instead of accomplishing their own goals instead .<-->O
I have no doubt that validation-seeking has caused me a lot of harm in terms of ideas or articles I could have come up with if I just sat still and held whatever discomfort I may have been feeling .<-->O
Twitter Was The Worst Of My Addictions Twitter was especially damaging to me .<-->N
There are several reasons : When I was thinking alone , and stumbled upon a good idea , I preferred to disrupt my thinking , share the 140-character condensed version on Twitter , and then keep checking for responses .<-->O
In effect , it was a thinking stopper .<-->N
Writing a blog post is hard , but constructing a tweet is easy , and you can get as many soma hits to your brain from new notifications as you would from a carefully thought-out blog post .<-->O
I estimate that I have not written at least 75 posts because of sharing crap on Twitter .<-->N
The content treadmill never ends .<-->N
It takes me about 20 minutes a day to read all the blogs I subscribe to .<-->N
The number of new content from my favorite sources are finite , like reading a newspaper , but on Twitter , you can sink hours following connections , conversations , entertaining beefs , and so on .<-->O
You can drop a tweet and check back two minutes later and then drop a reply that requires further checking .<-->N
It was both addicting and neverending .<-->N
Now when I read an article I like , I think about it for a minute or two .<-->O
If I have an interesting thought , I keep it going and ask myself if I can expand it into a proper article .<-->O
I ve nearly completely stopped sharing things on social networks .<-->N
The withdrawal from doing this was modest , only lasting a few days .<-->N
It was easier to kick than I thought it would be .<-->O
One important thing I must state is that the quality of my life has not gone down because of these changes .<-->O
I don t feel like I m missing out , because the information I got from Twitter did not offer solutions to specific problems I had .<-->O
Instead , it was entertainment , extra information that kept me distracted .<-->N
The truths I ve realized in life were not from reading a thousand articles on the same topic , but experiencing life on my own , taking risks , and then thinking about the resulting experiences .<-->N
Are You Addicted To The Internet ?<-->N
The best way to know if you have an internet addiction is to imagine how difficult it would be for you to limit social networking , email , and smartphone usage .<-->O
The harder it is , the more likely you have a problem of using the internet not as an informational tool but as a distractor and mood regulator of life .<-->O
I used to think that the internet was better than television in that it offered more mental rewards , but with the direction it has taken in the past 10 years , especially with the development of smartphone apps , I can no longer say that sharing or viewing items on Instagram , Facebook , or Twitter , and then checking obsessively for replies is better than watching a television comedy show .<-->O
Both require the lowest of brain function , but at least in the comedy you can encounter a joke to use on your friends to make them laugh .<-->O
If you look at the faces of people who are on their smartphones , mindlessly scrolling through Facebook , you ll see that it s as empty and hollow as those watching television .<-->O
If your approach to the internet is balanced , your usage should decrease as you start to solve the problems in your life .<-->O
If you are reading blogs for game advice , and your game starts getting sharper , you should be reading less game blogs .<-->O
If you understand the damage that a certain ideology is doing on society , like feminism , you should be reading less articles about feminism as time goes on .<-->O
Only when you establish a new goal , such as studying a language , should your internet usage temporarily rise to aid you .<-->N
But to constantly use it every day , regardless of what knowledge you already have on certain topics , what information you immediately need , or what your future goals are , means you are treating the internet not as a tool , but as a lifestyle , trading it in for real life instead .<-->O
Most of the population is not going to exhibit control in their internet usage by only reading select resources while not attention whoring on social networking , so it appears that we may have arrived at the point where , for the average person , the internet will cause them greater harm than being a couch potato .<-->O
It s time we all be more thoughtful about how we incorporate the internet into our daily routines , and make sure it doesn t take over our lives completely .<-->O

The internet can be seen as the most popular technology in the modern life .<-->O
Its facilities are applied for many aspects of life such as studying and working .<-->N
This essay will discuss why the Internet brings more harm than good .<-->O
The major reason supporting for this issue is that effect of using computer on health probems .<-->N
People usually use the Internet and they spend more time on sitting computers .<-->N
As a result , they can get eyes problems or pain back .<-->O
In addition , with Internet addicts , they can get mental problems because of abusing using the Internet .<-->N
In some countries , serisous cases caused by using computer for a long time has been happened .<-->N
For example , in Korea , a man died after playing games for 5 hours .<-->N
Another important reason is that Internet can bring the risk of insecurity .<-->O
In the modern life , poeple tend to use many security programes to protect their information .<-->O
It means that they must prepare for preventing unexpected trespass .<-->N
However , they still are attacked by someone through internet security faults .<-->N
Consequently , people can get personal troubles such as losing their control even or their important information is stolen .<-->O
These are some reasons supporting for this issue .<-->N

The first reason is that the Internet bring many advantages for people because of its convenience and popularity .<-->O
Through the internet , people can do many works in short time .<-->N
To illustrate , instead of going to supermarket , they can buy stuffs in the online market from anywhere .<-->F
This leads to saving time and helping people having more time to do other works .<-->N
In additon , one of the reason is that the Internet has many potential in studying , working or business .<-->N
For example , in many companies , they usually have online marketting projecst to promote their products because , people nowaday usually use the internet to read news or shopping .<-->N
So , advertisement in online market can become a good market performance .<-->N
Also , through the internet , students can gain more knowledge beside what they study from their school .<-->N
To conclude , the internet can bring harm but people can not deny that the internet is the most important achievements in 21 century .<-->O
The internet is usefel or not , that depend on the way peple using it .<-->N

Whatever you think , I assure you , it is not harmful .<-->O
I repeat the Internet is not harmful .<-->N
Many a times I hear that the Internet should never have existed .<-->N
What has it done ?<-->N

`` The Internet has done more harm than good to teenagers . ''<-->N
What are your views on this issue ?<-->N
Posted by Thanasis Nowadays , technological development and innovations render our life more comfortable and easier.The Internet is a remarkable example of this development.Its usage results in both comfort and dangers to teenagers ' life .<-->O
Fisrt of all , the Internet has faciliated the communication among people , which is much more accessible than before.In particular , thousands of messages are delivered instantly to people anywhere in the world by using e-mail which is free and fast.Secondly a wide variety of information is available on the Net.There are various topics about which someone can be informed.What is more , an abundance of services is provided on web ; such as e-banking , hotel reservations , job searching , online ticket buying , online shopping and legal software downloading .<-->O
On the other hand , a teenager will come across many threats when using the Web.In other words , there is the possibility of personal information theft , like name , address and banking details.Moreover many dangers are involved when teenagers log in social networks and meet on unknown persons , since they can be harmful and their intentions unknown.There are also communication problems due to the Internet misuse.Teenagers become passive , while obstancles are posed to the communication between the memebers of a family.Teenagers tend to decrease the number of their friends and acquaintances .<-->O
Scientists believe that teenagers are trying to solve their problems in an online world which makes them distant , isolated and lonely.Finally , radiation is emitted by the computer 's screen which is harmful to eyes .<-->O
In conclusion , it seems that there is no absolute answer to the question of whether the world wide web has done more harm than good to teenagers.In my opinion , a teenager should be permitted to use the Internet under terms in order to be offered only the benefits.Controlled and careful surfing prom Internet does more good than harm Posted by Albert The internet is a techological invention of the twentieth century that has truly changed human lives in many aspects .<-->O
Nowadays , distance has been shortened and communication improved thanks to this technological tool .<-->N
Those who are in favour of the use the internet point out many adventages .<-->N
To begin with , a great a mount of information is available with just one clik .<-->O
That is to say , Internet allows the world to be in contact with the latest current news .<-->N
Another adventatge is that virtual communication has been enhanced .<-->N
No matter where some one lives , he can be in touch with people from wherever they would live .<-->O
Futhermore , the use of Internet has made shopping easier .<-->N
There are many sites on the internet to shop without leaving the house or the working place .<-->N
On the other head , there is a growing body of criticism to using the internet .<-->N
Many opponents advocate that as personal information is available on it , the life of an internet user can be at risk .<-->N
Another disadventage is that there is always the possibility of being deceived by the sites selling products .<-->N
They can be of a lower quality or ever not arrive at costomers addresses at all , in spite of being paid in advance .<-->N
All things considered , it is true to say tat the Internet brings many benefits to people 's lives such as enhancing communication or allowing people to obtain products with no effort .<-->O
On the other hand , further consideration of the topic shows that it has many drawbacks like de posibility of being tricked .<-->O

Obama s plan to regulate the Internet would do more harm than good President Obama s call this week to regulate the Internet as a public utility is like pushing to replace the engine of a car that runs perfectly well .<-->O
The U.S. data sector including wired and wireless broadband is the envy of the world , administering a powerful boost to consumer welfare , generating high-paying jobs and encouraging tens of billions of dollars in corporate investment .<-->O
Indeed , the prices of data-related goods and services have dropped by almost 20 percent since 2007 .<-->N
Putting the Federal Communications Commission in charge of regulating broadband rates and micromanaging Web services , as the president proposes , would slow innovation and raise costs .<-->O
It would be bad news for the economy .<-->N
It would also be a serious misstep for the Democratic Party , marking a retreat from market-based , pro-competition policies pioneered by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s .<-->O
The issue here is how best to ensure an open Internet , in which big and small companies alike have unfettered access to customers .<-->O
After the courts threw out the old open Internet rules in January , virtually all concerned parties agreed the United States needed strong regulations to prevent blocking or discrimination online , to require real transparency for network-management policies by Internet service providers and to ban paid prioritization that could divide the Internet into fast-lane haves and slow-lane have-nots .<-->O
The debate is over the best policy road to take in enacting these rules .<-->O
One path using Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 would allow the FCC to enact strong rules and penalize Internet service providers who impede anyone s access to the bounty of the Web , while preserving the freedom to innovate and deploy new technologies .<-->O
The other road which relies on Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 would resuscitate decades-old public-utility regulations and enable the FCC -LRB- and a new layer of state agencies -RRB- to regulate prices and micromanage Internet services .<-->N
This is the road back in time that the president endorsed .<-->N
Each year , the Progressive Policy Institute -LRB- PPI -RRB- prepares an Investment Heroes report identifying the companies that are investing the most in the United States .<-->N
In 2013 , the telecom and cable industry led the list with $ 46 billion in investment .<-->N
Compare that with Europe , where Title II-style regulations have suffocated broadband innovation and investment .<-->N
Indeed , even the president admitted in his announcement that network investment remained strong under the current rules .<-->N
This is not an industry that needs a new approach and especially not a policy prescription borrowed from the failed monopoly-style regulations of the past .<-->N
A PPI analysis of government statistics shows that the data sector has been the main force driving gains in consumer welfare since 2007 .<-->N
Consumption of data-related goods and services per person has risen by 48 ?<-->N
percent since the recession started seven years ago .<-->N
By comparison , the real per capita consumption of all other goods and services is up by only 0.9 percent over the same stretch .<-->N
The number of computer and mathematical workers has risen by 35 percent since October 2007 .<-->F
These are high-paying jobs .<-->N
If Title II were the only way to enact strong open Internet rules and protect consumers , I would be the first to support it .<-->O
However , the more reliable Section 706 approach , suggested as a possible source of regulatory power by the court that struck down the last set of open Internet rules , provides ample authority to pass effective , market-based rules that give us the best of both worlds strong consumer protections within a pro-market framework .<-->O
Indeed , many experts believe Section 706 provides a stronger foundation to restrict anti-competitive paid prioritization deals because Title II expressly allows for whatever counts as reasonable discrimination among utility services and customers .<-->O
Meanwhile , Title II goes far beyond simple open Internet protections and could impose thousands of obsolete or harmful rules and regulations on the entire Internet ecosystem -LRB- not just broadband companies , but potentially application and content firms as well -RRB- .<-->O
The president suggests these destructive rules could simply be waved away using the FCC s power to forbear from applying its own rules .<-->O
But that s fool s gold .<-->N
Forbearance proceedings are lengthy and complex with uncertain outcomes , and they would provide yet another forum for special interests to litigate their pet issues .<-->O
The unpredictability and chaos of extended forbearance cases could do as much damage to investment and the Internet economy as Title II itself .<-->O
Title II could turn out to be a tremendous drag politically for the Democratic Party as well .<-->O
Putting the government in charge of Internet service will just make the Democrats the scapegoat when anything goes wrong .<-->O
That s not a good way to avoid a repeat of the 2014 election .<-->N
For economic , policy and political reasons , Title II is the wrong road for the FCC and the wrong road for our country .<-->N
The FCC would be wise to exercise its independent policymaking authority and ignore the president s backward-looking misstep .<-->O
------------------------ 10 .<-->N
Here are a few reasons why the internet might now be so good : 1 .<-->O
The quality of information online can not always be relied upon .<-->N
Threat to privacy .<-->F
Allowed a large amount of criminal activity , offensive and discriminatory information to be easily accessed .<-->O
Also , personally I feel like whenever I have gone online to put fears to rest about something , it generally gets worse after reading other peoples responses !<-->O
What do you think ?<-->N
Does the internet do more harm then good ?<-->N
The internet brings more good than harm in spite of its obvious problems .<-->O
`` The quality of information online can not always be replied upon '' : though this is absolutely true , there are reliable sources of information that are available online for free .<-->O
News sources such as BBC and CNN are available online as well as reputable organizations such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and various college websites .<-->O
In the field of early childhood education alone , there are dozens of websites that are reliable and helpful , including Harvard 's series on `` The Young Child . ''<-->N
The problem with site reliability online is that users do n't know how to decide if a site is reliable or not .<-->O
For example , as a bit of a hypochondriac , I have used WebMD to self-diagnose colds or sinus infections only to decide ten minutes later that I have all the symptoms of cancer .<-->N
Though WebMD is not exactly unreliable , it is used in ways it 's not intended to be .<-->O
Doctors should diagnose , not websites .<-->N
`` Threat to Privacy '' : again , I see this as more the user 's fault than the internet 's fault .<-->O
Anyone with a Facebook account should consider their posts public regardless of their privacy settings .<-->O
Social media is designed to be read by people , so using Facebook or Twitter as an online private journal is asking for trouble .<-->O
I do think there are legitimate privacy issues related to identity theft and online shopping , but top organizations like Amazon and eBay do their best to protect customers , and I am not concerned about their practices .<-->O
Crime , Discrimination , and Offensive Material : Online predators are an obvious problem .<-->N
The anonymity of the internet makes it easier for predators to take on identities that are appealing to teenagers and children .<-->N
However , the internet helps more people than it harms .<-->N
Overwhelmingly , children and teenagers use the internet to connect to others their own age and most are aware of basic internet safety in relation to predators .<-->O
Discrimination is a huge problem .<-->N
The comments section of news sites are safe havens for some of the craziest racists and misogynists out there .<-->N
This problem is easily solved , though , by not allowing comments or by moderators promptly removing offensive material .<-->O
There has also been enormous backlash against YouTube and Twitter comments that makes me hopeful about the future of internet communication .<-->O
Offensive Material : This is tricky because the concept of what is offensive is n't clear , and it varies from person to person .<-->O
Some people find pornography offensive , others do n't .<-->N
There are some things , such as child pornography , that are clearly illegal and offensive , but these are already targeted by law enforcement .<-->O
I think the larger issue is the ease of access to inappropriate material by people who are n't ready for it : children .<-->O
An 11-year-old with a phone can access porn through a Google search .<-->N
A kid with Netflix can choose to watch Breaking Bad instead of The Magic School Bus .<-->N
It 's scary how accessible adult material is to kids .<-->N
Ideally , we would have kid-specific products so that they ca n't access inappropriate shows or photos .<-->O
Imagine if there was an iPad for kids that automatically blocked adult sites and search words !<-->N
It would be great !<-->N
But while I 'm waiting for this to exist , I want to point out that this is also an issue of parents failing to monitor what their kids are exposed to , and also an issue of punishing kids for discovering inappropriate material instead of explaining what the material is and why it is not okay .<-->O
If parents took a bigger role in demystifying violence and porn and explaining how it is different from reality , I think kids would be less fascinated by it .<-->O
Even though the internet has made offensive and frivolous things more accessible , it has also made informational and emotional support more accessible .<-->O
Websites like ScarletTeen and Planned Parenthood can educate teenagers on sexuality far better than some sex ed programs in schools , sites like Tumblr and Twitter can spread current events faster than most news publications , and social media has helped many people who are socially awkward reach out to people in a way that is comfortable for them .<-->O
In the grand scheme of things , the internet is a powerful tool for good more than it is a tool for causing harm .<-->O
Even though it has made bullying easier and privacy harder to control , I would argue that these problems already existed but the internet just made them easier , and as these problems grow serious , the internet is even better at stopping them than it is at perpetuating them .<-->O
The internet is a huge source of information and social networking that is accessible , at least in the US , to all income levels , age levels , and cultures and most importantly , it has created conversations between people who may have never met in real life !<-->O
Driving age increase to 18 and curfew for new drivers mooted Passing a driving test and getting a licence is a rite of passage for many teenagers .<-->F
But they may have to wait an extra year if the government implements changes being proposed .<-->F
A report commissioned by the government recommends that probationary licences are in future issued from the age of 18 .<-->F
Currently a provisional driving licence for a car can be applied for three months before the applicant turns 17 ; a provisional licence for a motorcycle or moped can be applied for three months before they turn 16 .<-->N
The proposals suggest a 12-month `` learner stage '' during which drivers would have to clock up 100 hours of daytime driving practice under supervision , and 20 hours at night .<-->N
A curfew would see the roads clear of newly qualified drivers between 10pm and 5am unless they were carrying a passenger aged over 30 and they would be banned from travelling with anyone younger than that if they themselves are not yet 30 .<-->O
Currently , a provisional licence-holder , no matter their age , has to be accompanied by a driver over 21 who has held a full licence for at least three years .<-->O
More than 20 % of deaths on Britain 's roads in 2011 involved drivers aged 17-24 and about 10 % of novice drivers are caught committing an offence within their probationary period .<-->N
Young male drivers aged 17-20 are seven times more at risk of a road accident than the average male driver ; between the hours of 2am and 5am that risk is 17 times higher , according to research from the Centre for Transport Studies .<-->N
A Department for Transport spokesman said : `` Young drivers drive around 5 % of all the miles driven in Britain , but are involved in about 20 % of the crashes where someone is killed or seriously injured . ''<-->O
Motoring organisations welcomed the proposals .<-->N
Stephen Glaister , director of the RAC Foundation , said : `` Young people are four times more likely to die in a road accident than as a result of drink or drugs .<-->N
`` Yet , as a society we seem to turn a blind eye to the carnage .<-->O
If this was any other area of public health there would be an outcry .<-->N
`` Circumstances conspire against young drivers .<-->N
Their youth and lack of experience create a deadly mix which means one in five will have an accident within the first six months of passing their test . ''<-->O
The proposals are part of a government commissioned report from the Transport Research Laboratory which will inform a green paper to be released later this year --------------------- 2 .<-->N
Teen Driving Age Should Be Raised , Says Auto Safety Group CHICAGO Taking aim at a longstanding rite of passage for 16-year-olds , an influential auto safety group is calling on states to raise the age for getting a driver 's license to 17 or even 18 .<-->N
Adrian Lund , president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , a research group funded by the auto insurance industry , acknowledged the idea is `` a tough sell , '' but noted that car crashes are the leading cause of death among teenagers .<-->O
`` The bottom line is that when we look at the research , raising the driving age saves lives , '' Lund said .<-->N
He plans to present the proposal Tuesday at the annual conference of the Governors Highway Safety Association in Scottsdale , Ariz. .<-->N
Not surprisingly , a lot of teens hate the idea .<-->O
`` I would really be upset because I 've waited SO long to drive , '' said Diamante White , a 16-year-old in Reading , Pa. , who got her permit in July .<-->O
She said learning to drive is a `` growing-up experience . ''<-->N
Many parents agree .<-->N
They also like not having to chauffeur their teens to school , sporting events and any number of other places .<-->N
`` Do we really want our kids dependent upon parents for virtually everything until they go to college , can vote and serve their country ? ''<-->O
asked Margaret Menotti , a mother in Uxbridge , Mass. .<-->N
She argued that keeping teens from driving would only make them less responsible .<-->O
Some parents also find it ironic that this conversation is happening just as a group of college presidents have proposed lowering the drinking age to 18 .<-->O
Among other things , institute researchers have compiled decades worth of data from New Jersey , the only state that issues licenses at 17 .<-->N
Various studies have shown that the overall rate of teens killed in crashes in New Jersey has been consistently lower than in some nearby states .<-->N
One study from the 1990s found that the rate of crash-related deaths among 16 - and 17-year olds were 18 per 100,000 in New Jersey , compared with 26 per 100,000 in Connecticut .<-->N
Those rates , researchers said , have dropped even further since both states instituted graduated driver 's license programs .<-->N
Graduated licensing , which has become the standard across the country in the past 15 years , requires teens to spend more time driving with a parent or other responsible adult before they go solo .<-->N
Though these rules are sometimes difficult to enforce , many states tie these more stringent standards to declining teen crash rates .<-->O
More than 5,000 U.S. teens die each year in car crashes .<-->N
The rate of crashes , fatal and nonfatal , per mile driven for 16-year-old drivers is almost 10 times the rate for drivers ages 30 to 59 , according to the National Highway Safety Administration .<-->N
Many industrialized countries in Europe and elsewhere have a driving age of 17 or 18 .<-->N
Barbara Harsha , executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association , said she welcomes a debate on raising the driving age _ as do many who deal with public health .<-->N
`` Getting the highest of the high-risk drivers away from the wheel probably is n't a bad idea , '' said Dr. Barbara Gaines , trauma director at Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC .<-->O
But she and others _ even the Insurance Institute officials who propose raising the driving age _ agreed it is not the only option .<-->N
Gaines noted that teen drivers in the Pittsburgh area who have committed moving violations must attend a `` reality education '' program at her hospital .<-->O
They tour the intensive care unit and talk with young drivers who have been in serious crashes .<-->O
Andrea Summers , coordinator of the teen driving program for the Delaware Office of Highway Safety , said her state and others have chosen to toughen laws without raising the driving age _ by banning teens from using cell phones while driving , imposing stricter driving curfews and expanding supervised driving time .<-->N
Even New Jersey is considering lengthening the time a young driver has a permit , from six months to 12 .<-->N
Still others say we are worrying too much about teen drivers , and not enough about others who cause serious problems on the road .<-->O
Karen Sternheimer , a University of Southern California sociologist who studies accident statistics , cited federal data from 2007 showing that drivers ages 25 to 34 , as well as those ages 45 to 64 , were nearly twice as likely to be involved in alcohol-related fatalities as 16 - to 20-year-old drivers .<-->N
`` The intense focus on teens diverts our attention from the real threats to public safety : speeding and driving while intoxicated , '' she said .<-->O

Should we Raise the Legal Driving Age ?<-->N
The legal driving age has been a constant debate and every few years another log is thrown onto the fire .<-->N
Should we really raise the legal age to drive ?<-->N
Would it save lives ?<-->N
If so , how high should we raise it ?<-->O
Currently , most states allow for teen drivers to apply for a drivers permit 6 months after their 15th birthday .<-->N
Some say this is way too soon Should we Raise the Legal Driving Age ?<-->N
8 months ago Driving Age The legal driving age has been a constant debate and every few years another log is thrown onto the fire .<-->N
Should we really raise the legal age to drive ?<-->N
Would it save lives ?<-->N
If so , how high should we raise it ?<-->O

Some say this is way too soon .<-->N
Teen Driving is Deadly It s an unfortunate truth , but auto accidents are the leading cause of death among teenagers .<-->O
A 16 year old is almost twice as likely to die in a car crash than a 30 year old .<-->N
And with new issues such as cell phone driving , texting while driving , and other forms of distracted driving , there is good reason to debate this issue .<-->O
If we can take the most dangerous drivers off the road , we will not only save the lives of young adults , but we will also make the roadways safer for everyone else .<-->O
But Driving is Deadly for all Age Groups What s interesting is the leading cause of death for 15 to 24 year olds is auto accidents .<-->O
They are the only age group where this is true .<-->N
However , car crashes are the leading cause of accidental death in all age groups over 4 years old !<-->O
Let s face it , 15 to 24 year olds aren t plagued with disease and sickness like older folks are .<-->O
So it s only natural that their leading cause of death will be accidental , and will also be the leading accidental death for nearly every age group .<-->O
So the stats aren t exactly cut and dry .<-->N
Is it Age or Inexperience ?<-->N
Consider These Points Is age really the biggest factor to consider ?<-->O
If we raise the legal driving age to , say , 17 years old , wouldn t 17 year olds have the highest accident rate simply due to lack of experience ?<-->N
Many argue that our decision making skills aren t fully developed at 16 -LRB- the legal age at which a license can actually be obtained -RRB- .<-->O
However , this is mostly unsubstantiated evidence and since every person develops differently , a blanketed law is going to punish those who are ready .<-->O
I m a truck driver and see this with new truckers .<-->N
The legal age to receive a commercial drivers license is 18 years old , but most don t obtain their commercial drivers license until after the age of 21 .<-->N
The most dangerous truck drivers on the road are those with under 2 years of experience , regardless of age .<-->O
It s likely that if we simply raise the driving age , we will only shift the problem drivers to a higher age bracket .<-->O
By the way , be sure to check out these tips for driving around semi trucks Major Issues with Raising the Legal Driving Age Aside from young teens hating the idea , do we really want our kids dependent upon us for everything ?<-->O
Do we really want to chauffeur our kids everywhere , up until the point they graduate high school , go off to college , or even join the military ?<-->O
Getting a drivers license is a right of passage so to speak .<-->O
We have to let go at some point or another .<-->N
Most teens don t have access to public transit .<-->N
We need to let them have some freedom .<-->O
We need to let them get jobs .<-->N
We need to let them grow up .<-->N
And learning to drive is one of the very first steps into adulthood .<-->O
The world is a dangerous place , but we must let go at some point .<-->O
A Graduated Solution Every child and every teenager develops in their own unique way .<-->N
Instead of forcing the government to make blanketed laws , let s leave things the way they are and force parents to be parents .<-->N
Allow mom and dad to decide if their child should drive or not .<-->O
Who knows a teenager better than the teenagers guardian ?<-->O
Most states have developed a graduated licensing program , which has proven to be successful .<-->N
This includes more time behind the wheel with a supervised and licensed adult , more classroom time , and zero tolerance policies for traffic violations -LRB- a violation could result in further training or even license revocation -RRB- .<-->O
Limiting forms of distracted driving is also a good idea .<-->N
Some states have a graduated rider program .<-->N
At first , no passengers are allowed unless it s an adult .<-->F
After some experience , they can bring more passengers on board .<-->N
Zero tolerance cell phone use and driving curfew laws have also proven to be successful .<-->N
Traditionally , we have given full license privileges to 16 year olds .<-->N
Instead of simply raising the driving age , we should continue to implement programs which slowly gives more driving privileges to teens as they prove themselves to be safe , trustworthy drivers .<-->O
Let s treat this as an experience issue , not an age issue .<-->N
----------------------------- 4 .<-->N
The minimum driving age should be raised to 18 Young drivers , and even older ones , cause many fatal accidents ; raising the minimum age at which people can drive might reduce this , but is it a benefit to society , and are the statistics true ?<-->O
We can help lower the accident rates if the driving age is raised to 18 so no more kids can get hurt or killed in a accident on the freeway or by another car crashing into their car if we raise the driving age it will be safer for the young and old drivers .<-->O
All the Yes points The number of serious or fatal road accidents in the UK will be reduced 17 year olds are simply not mature enough to cope with the skills required for driving Young people may have a racer boy attitude to driving Raising the age limit may do something to promote more environmentally friendly alternatives They should undergo a one year ` settling down ' process People who go to university will hardy have any time to learn how to drive !<-->O
No because younger drivers are n't necessarily dangerous Raising Driving Age should the driving age be raised to 18 driving at age 16 You should raise it !<-->O
age of 18 driving life Some teenagers text and are therefore not reliable .<-->N
yes they should raise it up .<-->N
16 year olds are irresponsible .<-->N
my friends friend and his buddies were killed in a car wreck they were 16 .<-->O
All the No points Other countries are even younger in America only 16 !<-->N
The accidents may just be delayed by one year It removes the freedom of young people There are alternatives such as making tests more rigorous Raising the driving age to 21 would be a much better idea .<-->O
Parents can provide guidance to their teens It denies young people access to safe transportation Driving ability should be judged more - why not also a maximum age ?!<-->O
No , lack of maturity .<-->N
Driving age should n't be raised to 18 No Males are 77 % more likely than females to kill someone while driving .<-->O
Ban men from driving ?<-->N
The assumption that teens lack maturity to drive is highly incorrect no it should n't The number of serious or fatal road accidents in the UK will be reduced The numbers speak for themselves .<-->O
Statistics have shown that 15 % of all accident deaths on UK roads involve drivers under the age of 21 .<-->N
Research shows that 17 to 20 year olds are about seven times more likely to be killed or injured in an accident -LRB- per mile of driving -RRB- .<-->N
This is illustrated by the fact that 135 teenage drivers were killed on UK roads during 2007 , with many more injured .<-->N
Raising the minimum driving age to 18 would dramatically decrease deaths and injuries .<-->O
Raising the age does not guarantee a reduction in deaths .<-->N
Rather , it would just change the statistics from `` 17 to 20 year olds '' to `` 18 to 21 year olds '' .<-->O
The reason why drivers crash is a lack of experience , and an 18 year old with one year 's worth of experience is just as likely to crash as a 17 year old with one year 's experience .<-->O
For that matter , it would be the same with a 35 year old with one year 's experience .<-->N
Raising the age therefore would not dramatically increase deaths and injuries .<-->O
You may be able to change the age , but you ca n't change the people !<-->N
Additionally , one can not say logically that one must raise the driving age because teenagers are harming others and/or being harmed while driving .<-->N
For example , a parallel can be found in driving statistics for males versus females .<-->N
According to studies , males of all ages are 77 % more likely to kill someone when driving than females .<-->N
It would be just as illogical to raise the driving age to 18 as to ban males from driving.it wo n't help if your sitting on tour butt for two more years doing nothing you might be more mature at 18 but that does n't mean your mature enough for the road .<-->O
17 year olds are simply not mature enough to cope with the skills required for driving One reason to show that 18 year olds have a more mature mind then 16 year olds is because of the pressure of college and being on your own .<-->O
When you are 18 you think about the life ahead of you which stresses you out because one day you will have to pay for everything and also if you are not yet in college you would rather have some money then your parents pay for an accident .<-->O
This is false because I would like the ability to drive to work because I am turning into a responsible adult .<-->O
If YOUR parents did not raise you right other people should not suffer for your insolence .<-->O
Everybody is different .<-->N
To say that someone at the age of seventeen is not mentally mature is a sweeping generalisation .<-->N
Some people by the age of 18 may well not have reached what the proposition cite as `` full mental maturity '' .<-->O
Some people may never reach `` full mental maturity '' .<-->N
We mature at different rates , and therefore we have safeguards to ensure that those driving have sufficient `` mental maturity '' , and it 's called `` the driving test '' .<-->O
If you have n't passed , you ca n't legally drive without a person who has held a full clean licence for three years with you .<-->O
Doing so is breaking the law and is punished .<-->N
Raising the age to 18 would have no effect whatsoever because the driving test is there to ensure the `` mental maturity '' of the driver before he is fully qualified .<-->O
Peole are going to be the same no matter how old they are !<-->N
There are some people that are 20 years old and above that are still not mature .<-->O
It so depends on what type of person you are .<-->N
People need to grow up sometime .<-->N
Im 17 years old , didnt take drivers ed , took ten questions for my written drivers test -LRB- in oklahoma -RRB- , failed my behind the seat drivers test , went back got a hundred , have yet to be pulled over , and get a ticket .<-->N
Never got in a wreck , dont talk on my cell phone , can drive in cities like LA and San Francisco no problem .<-->O
And see many many many horrible drivers everywhere i go .<-->N
I dont think the age limit should be raised , i think if you mess up once you lose your privilege to drive period .<-->O
Stupid biased point .<-->N
I 'm a female from the u.k and disagree that 17 year olds are immature .<-->N
Some are but not all of us it 's mainly `` boy racers '' that crash not everybody else .<-->N
Adults are also liable to crash .<-->N
So do n't raise the age because It 's pointless waste of time and money .<-->N
Young people may have a racer boy attitude to driving The immaturity of some young people may deem that they are not sensible enough to be let loose on the roads .<-->O
British law does not allow citizens most adult privileges until the age of 18 .<-->N
Why should driving be any different ?<-->N
The proposition forgets that drivers are not `` let loose '' on the roads , but that they must take a test first to ensure their driving proficiency .<-->N
And to generalise and say that 17 year olds are immature is wrong .<-->N
In fact , many boy-racers are over the age of 20 at least .<-->N
Look at the presenters and audience of Top Gear .<-->N
Raising the age limit may do something to promote more environmentally friendly alternatives If young people are not permitted to drive , they would effectively be forced into looking for alternatives to get about .<-->O
This may mean that they are encouraged to use greener alternatives such as public transport .<-->O
Instilling this idea at a young age could mean that they think about the environment more in the future an ever increasing issue in today s climate .<-->O
People should have the choice as to whether they drive or use other forms of transport .<-->O
If the government wanted to promote greener transport then it should do it in a way that does not just discriminate against young people .<-->O
Also not everybody has access to public transport especially young people !<-->N
This in turn would be a much less effective way for young people to get about as they would become more reliant on others , like their parents , to get them about which is not always practical .<-->O
They should undergo a one year ` settling down ' process They should not be allowed to carry passengers until one year after passing the test .<-->O
This would allow them to acquire some road sense and , hopefully , common sense .<-->O
Any misdemeanours and the clock restarts .<-->N
Three strikes within that year and they are banned for life .<-->F
So is the loss of an innocent life .<-->N
This has nothing to do with raising the legal driving age .<-->N
First off there is already a restriction that states that a driver under the age of 18 can not have more than one non-family member under 18 as a passenger in their car .<-->N
Get your facts straight .<-->N
And why should all younger drivers be penalised for the mistakes for a few .<-->N
As some studies have shown 77 % of males of all ages are more likely to kill someone than a female , so should be also ban males from having passengers ?<-->O
Also I thought the ` P ' plate process was a ` settling down ' process , where PROVISIONAL drivers are watched more closely than open drivers . .<-->O
People who go to university will hardy have any time to learn how to drive !<-->O
They will have lots of work to do !<-->N
Believe me I know !<-->N
I tried to learn whilst I was in Uni and I just couldn t cope with the amount of work and learning how to drive .<-->O
It s been two years since I first tried to pass the test and I still haven t passed !<-->N
So instead all the 18 year old drivers are the ones not smart enough to go to University or the ones who do go but had very little time to practice .<-->O
Now you will just have the poor 18 year old drivers giving their smart friends rides to school .<-->O
No because younger drivers are n't necessarily dangerous There are just as many people who are careless and inconsiderate drivers who are much older than 17year olds .<-->O
Some 17 year old drivers are more sensible and cautious than those who have been driving for years .<-->N
Many more elderly people are dangerous on roads than younger people as they have slower reaction times and can struggle with visibility .<-->O
Therefore , should older people have to re-take a test to make sure they are still fit to drive ?<-->O
Younger drivers may be less experienced , but does n't experience come with practice ?<-->N
Therefore why not let people take a test at 17 if they want to ?<-->N
It may make them better drivers as they learnt early and gained practice and experience .<-->N
17 Years of age is a good age to start .<-->N
Most teens are in there prime from 16 - 26 .<-->N
Those are the best years that they WILL have the best reaction time .<-->O
In the USA in some states it is 14 to drive .<-->N
For example , I Iowa they let you drive at the age of 14 .<-->N
That could be bad or good .<-->O
But the thing is they keep you in a certain area until they reach a certain age .<-->N
Then you can go across the country .<-->N
But they do n't let anyone under 18 drive anywhere but the home state .<-->N
So whats the difference in the USA ?<-->N
If an applicant is 17 years of age or younger when they apply for their learner permit , they must hold the learner permit for six months before applying for a driver license .<-->N
However , if the applicant turns 18 during the holding period , they may apply for their driver license upon turning 18 .<-->N
The six-month learner permit holding requirement does not apply to an applicant who is age 18 or older at the time of application for the learner permit .<-->N
Raising Driving Age The number of car accidents will be reduced if we raise it Sure , but the percentage ?<-->N
I highly doubt so .<-->N
All you are doing is discriminating against young drivers and reducing number of drivers and cars on the road .<-->N
It could lower the number of accidents , too , if I just chose that no one could drive who is over 70 .<-->O
Teenagers may take their eyes of the road , texting , and crash into another vehicle .<-->N
Most accidents happen because the teens think that it is more inportant to talk or text there friends then to pay attention to the road .<-->N
PUT the PHONE AWAY and PAY attention you cant text when your home or not in the driver seat .<-->N
So why do n't the parents take the phone from the teens when they 're driving and give them back later .<-->N
I think that sited texting while driving should automatically be a ticket .<-->N
DO N'T PUNISH ALL TEENS for the CARELESS FEW .<-->N
yes they should raise it up .<-->N
16 year olds are irresponsible .<-->N
my friends friend and his buddies were killed in a car wreck they were 16 .<-->O
too many deaths are caused by 16 year old drivers .<-->N
`` oh haha lets get drunk and drive we are cool cuz we are 16 ! ''<-->O
i dont think so Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among 15 - to 20-year-olds .<-->O
16-year-olds have higher crash rates than drivers of any other age .<-->N
16-year-olds are 3 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle crash than the average of all drivers .<-->N
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Center for Statistics and Analysis , in 2008 : Hand-held cellphone use was highest among 16 - to 24-year-olds -LRB- 8 % in 2008 , down from 9 % in 2007 -RRB- .<-->N
37 % of male drivers ages 15-20 who were involved in fatal crashes were speeding at the time .<-->N
55 % , or 2,014 , of the 3,678 occupants of passenger vehicles ages 16-20 who were killed in crashes were not buckled up .<-->N
31 % of drivers ages 15-20 who were killed in motor vehicle crashes had been drinking some amount of alcohol ; 25 % were alcohol-impaired , meaning they had a blood alcohol content of 0.08 grams per deciliter or higher .<-->O
Statistics show that 16 - and 17-year-old driver death rates increase with each additional passenger -LRB- IIHS -RRB- .<-->N
I m sorry but I disagree with you completely .<-->O
Yes , I agree there are SOME immature sixteen year olds out there who are like that , but you can t stereotype ALL sixteen year olds because of something idiotic someone else of that age did .<-->O
I m sixteen years old and I drive better then half the adults on the road I see these days .<-->O
There are people of ALL ages driving on the road reckless because they think they re an adult therefore they can get off the hook .<-->O
I know people who were OLDER then 16 - more like between the ages of 18 - 30 - who ve been caught drunk driving or even dyients work , and he had to get himself from football practice to his job as a lifeguard .<-->O
`` I 've driven with some people who are horrible drivers even though they 've been driving for a while , '' Moore said .<-->O
`` And I 've driven with people who have n't been driving very long but are pretty good .<-->O
Some people are ready , and some people are n't . ''<-->N

Is 16 too young to drive a car ?<-->N
Raise the driving age .<-->N
That radical idea is gaining momentum in the fight to save the lives of teenage drivers the most dangerous on the USA 's roads and their passengers .<-->O
Brain and auto safety experts fear that 16-year-olds , the youngest drivers licensed in most states , are too immature to handle today 's cars and roadway risks .<-->O
New findings from brain researchers at the National Institutes of Health explain for the first time why efforts to protect the youngest drivers usually fail .<-->N
The weak link : what 's called `` the executive branch '' of the teen brain the part that weighs risks , makes judgments and controls impulsive behavior .<-->O
Scientists at the NIH campus in Bethesda , Md. , have found that this vital area develops through the teenage years and is n't fully mature until age 25 .<-->O
One 16-year-old 's brain might be more developed than another 18-year-old 's , just as a younger teen might be taller than an older one .<-->O
But evidence is mounting that a 16-year-old 's brain is generally far less developed than those of teens just a little older .<-->O
The research seems to help explain why 16-year-old drivers crash at far higher rates than older teens .<-->N
The studies have convinced a growing number of safety experts that 16-year-olds are too young to drive safely without supervision .<-->O
`` Privately , a lot of people in safety think it 's a good idea to raise the driving age , '' says Barbara Harsha , executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association .<-->O
`` It 's a topic that is emerging . ''<-->N
Americans increasingly favor raising the driving age , a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll has found .<-->O
Nearly two-thirds 61 % say they think a 16-year-old is too young to have a driver 's license .<-->N
Only 37 % of those polled thought it was OK to license 16-year-olds , compared with 50 % who thought so in 1995 .<-->O
A slight majority , 53 % , think teens should be at least 18 to get a license .<-->O
The poll of 1,002 adults , conducted Dec. 17-19 , 2004 , has an error margin of + / -3 percentage points .<-->N
Many states have begun to raise the age by imposing restrictions on 16-year-old drivers .<-->N
Examples : limiting the number of passengers they can carry or barring late-night driving .<-->N
But the idea of flatly forbidding 16-year-olds to drive without parental supervision as New Jersey does has run into resistance from many lawmakers and parents around the country .<-->O
Irving Slosberg , a Florida state representative who lost his 14-year-old daughter in a 1995 crash , says that when he proposed a law to raise the driving age , other lawmakers `` laughed at me . ''<-->N
Bill Van Tassel , AAA 's national manager of driving training programs , hears both sides of the argument .<-->N
`` We have parents who are pretty much tired of chauffeuring their kids around , and they want their children to be able to drive , '' he says .<-->O
`` Driving is a very emotional issue . ''<-->N
But safety experts fear inaction could lead to more young lives lost .<-->O
Some sound a note of urgency about changing course .<-->N
The reason : A record number of American teenagers will soon be behind the wheel as the peak of the `` baby boomlet '' hits driving age .<-->O
Already , on average , two people die every day across the USA in vehicles driven by 16-year-old drivers .<-->N
One in five 16-year-olds will have a reportable car crash within the first year .<-->N
In 2003 , there were 937 drivers age 16 who were involved in fatal crashes .<-->N
In those wrecks , 411 of the 16-year-old drivers died and 352 of their passengers were killed .<-->N
Sixteen-year-old drivers are involved in fatal crashes at a rate nearly five times the rate of drivers 20 or older .<-->N
Gayle Bell , whose 16-year-old daughter , Jessie , rolled her small car into a Missouri ditch and died in July 2003 , says she used to happily be Jessie 's `` ride . ''<-->N
She would give anything for the chance to drive Jessie again .<-->N
`` We were always together , but not as much after she got her license , '' Bell says .<-->N
`` If I could bring her back , I 'd lasso the moon . ''<-->O
Most states have focused their fixes on giving teens more driving experience before granting them unrestricted licenses .<-->N
But the new brain research suggests that a separate factor is just as crucial : maturity .<-->O
A new 17 - or 18-year-old driver is considered safer than a new 16-year-old driver .<-->N
Even some teens are acknowledging that 16-year-olds are generally not ready to face the life-threatening risks that drivers can encounter behind the wheel .<-->N
`` Raising the driving age from 16 to 17 would benefit society as a whole , '' says Liza Darwin , 17 , of Nashville .<-->N
Though many parents would be inconvenienced and teens would be frustrated , she says , `` It makes sense to raise the driving age to save more lives . ''<-->O
Focus on lawmakers But those in a position to raise the driving age legislators in states throughout the USA have mostly refused to do so .<-->O
Adrienne Mandel , a Maryland state legislator , has tried since 1997 to pass tougher teen driving laws .<-->N
Even lawmakers who recognize that a higher driving age could save lives , Mandel notes , resist the notion of having to drive their 16-year-olds to after-school activities that the teens could drive to themselves .<-->O
`` Other delegates said , ` What are you doing ?<-->N
You 're going to make me drive my kid to the movies on Friday night for another six months ? ' ''<-->N
Mandel says .<-->N
`` Parents are talking about inconvenience , and I 'm talking about saving lives . ''<-->N
Yet the USA TODAY poll found that among the general public , majorities in both suburbs -LRB- 65 % -RRB- and urban areas -LRB- 60 % -RRB- favor licensing ages above 16 .<-->O
While a smaller percentage in rural areas -LRB- 54 % -RRB- favor raising the driving age , experts say it 's striking that majority support exists even there , considering that teens on farms often start driving very young to help with workloads .<-->O
For those who oppose raising the minimum age , their argument is often this : Responsible teen drivers should n't be punished for the mistakes of the small fraction who cause deadly crashes .<-->O
The debate stirs images of reckless teens drag-racing or driving drunk .<-->O
But such flagrant misdeeds account for only a small portion of the fatal actions of 16-year-old drivers .<-->O
Only about 10 % of the 16-year-old drivers killed in 2003 had blood-alcohol concentrations of 0.10 or higher , compared with 43 % of 20 - to 49-year-old drivers killed , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .<-->N
Instead , most fatal crashes with 16-year-old drivers -LRB- 77 % -RRB- involved driver errors , especially the kind most common among novices .<-->O
Examples : speeding , overcorrecting after veering off the road , and losing control when facing a roadway obstacle that a more mature driver would be more likely to handle safely .<-->O
That 's the highest percentage of error for any age group .<-->N
For years , researchers suspected that inexperience the bane of any new driver was mostly to blame for deadly crashes involving teens .<-->O
When trouble arose , the theory went , the young driver simply made the wrong move .<-->O
But in recent years , safety researchers have noticed a pattern emerge one that seems to stem more from immaturity than from inexperience .<-->N
`` Skills are a minor factor in most cases , '' says Allan Williams , former chief scientist at the insurance institute .<-->N
`` It 's really attitudes and emotions . ''<-->O
A peek inside the brain The NIH brain research suggests that the problem is human biology .<-->N
A crucial part of the teen 's brain the area that peers ahead and considers consequences remains undeveloped .<-->N
That means careless attitudes and rash emotions often drive teen decisions , says Jay Giedd , chief of brain imaging in the child psychiatric unit at the National Institute of Mental Health , who 's leading the study .<-->O
`` It all comes down to impulse control , '' Giedd says .<-->N
`` The brain is changing a lot longer than we used to think .<-->N
And that part of the brain involved in decision-making and controlling impulses is among the latest to come on board . ''<-->N
The teen brain is a paradox .<-->N
Some areas those that control senses , reactions and physical abilities are fully developed in teenagers .<-->O
`` Physically , they should be ruling the world , '' Giedd says .<-->N
`` But -LRB- adolescence -RRB- is not that great of a time emotionally . ''<-->N
Giedd and an international research team have analyzed 4,000 brain scans from 2,000 volunteers to document how brains evolve as children mature .<-->N
In his office at the NIH , Giedd points to an image of a brain on his computer screen that illustrates brain development from childhood to adulthood .<-->N
As he sets the time lapse in motion , the brain turns blue rapidly in some areas and more slowly in others .<-->N
One area that 's slow to turn blue which represents development over time is the right side just over the temple .<-->O
It 's the spot on the head where a parent might tap a frustrated finger while asking his teen , `` What were you thinking ? ''<-->O
This underdeveloped area is called the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex .<-->N
The underdeveloped blue on Giedd 's screen is where thoughts of long-term consequences spring to consciousness .<-->N
And in teen after teen , the research team found , it 's not fully mature .<-->N
`` This is the top rung , '' Giedd says .<-->N
`` This is the part of the brain that , in a sense , associates everything .<-->N
All of our hopes and dreams for the future .<-->N
All of our memories of the past .<-->N
Our values .<-->N
Everything going on in our environment .<-->F
Everything to make a decision . ''<-->N
When a smart , talented and very mature teen does something a parent might call `` stupid , '' Giedd says , it 's this underdeveloped part of the brain that has most likely failed .<-->O
`` That 's the part of the brain that helps look farther ahead , '' he says .<-->N
`` In a sense , increasing the time between impulse and decisions .<-->N
It seems not to get as good as it 's going to get until age 25 . ''<-->N
This slow process plays a kind of dirty trick on teens , whose hormones are churning .<-->O
As their bodies turn more adultlike , the hormones encourage more risk-taking and thrill-seeking .<-->N
That might be nature 's way of helping them leave the nest .<-->O
But as the hormones fire up the part of the brain that responds to pleasure , known as the limbic system , emotions run high .<-->O
Those emotions make it hard to quickly form wise judgments the kind drivers must make every day .<-->O
That 's also why teens often seem more impetuous than adults .<-->N
In making decisions , they rely more on the parts of their brain that control emotion .<-->N
They 're `` hotter '' when angry and `` colder '' when sad , Giedd says .<-->O
When a teen is traveling 15 to 20 miles per hour over the speed limit , the part of his or her brain that processes a thrill is working brilliantly .<-->O
But the part that warns of negative consequences ?<-->N
It 's all but useless .<-->N
`` It may not seem that fast to them , '' Giedd says , because they 're not weighing the same factors an adult might .<-->O
They 're not asking themselves , he says , '' ` Should I go fast or not ? '<-->N
And dying is not really part of the equation . ''<-->N
Precisely how brain development plays out on the roads has yet to be studied .<-->N
Giedd says brain scans of teens in driving simulations might tell researchers exactly what 's going on in their heads .<-->O
That could lead to better training and a clearer understanding of which teens are ready to make critical driving decisions .<-->O
In theory , a teen 's brain could eventually be scanned to determine whether he or she was neurologically fit to drive .<-->O
But Giedd says that ethical crossroad is too radical to seriously consider today .<-->O
`` We are just at the threshold of this , '' he says .<-->N
Finding explanations The new insights into the teen brain might help explain why efforts to protect young drivers , ranging from driver education to laws that restrict teen driving , have had only modest success .<-->O
With the judgment center of the teen brain not fully developed , parents and states must struggle to instill decision-making skills in still-immature drivers .<-->O
In nearly every state , 16-year-old drivers face limits known as `` graduated licensing '' rules .<-->N
These restrictions vary .<-->N
But typically , they bar 16-year-olds from carrying other teen passengers , driving at night or driving alone until they have driven a certain number of hours under parental supervision .<-->O
These states have , in effect , already raised their driving age .<-->N
Safety experts say lives have been saved as a result .<-->N
But it 's mostly left to parents to enforce the restrictions , and the evidence suggests enforcement has been weak .<-->N
Teens probably appear to their parents at the dinner table to be more in control than they are behind the wheel .<-->N
They might recite perfectly the risks of speeding , drinking and driving or distractions , such as carrying passengers or talking on a cell phone , Giedd says .<-->O
But their brains are built to learn more from example .<-->N
For teenagers , years of watching parents drive after downing a few glasses of wine or while chatting on a cell phone might make a deeper imprint than a lecture from a driver education teacher .<-->O
The brain research raises this question : How well can teen brains respond to the stresses of driving ?<-->N
More research on teen driving decisions is needed , safety advocates say , before definitive conclusions can be drawn.And more public support is probably needed before politicians would seriously consider raising the driving age .<-->O
In the 1980s , Congress pressuredstates to raise their legal age to buy alcohol to 21 .<-->N
The goal was to stop teens from crossing borders to buy alcohol , after reports of drunken teens dying in auto crashes .<-->N
Fueled by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving , public support for stricter laws grew until Congress forced a rise in the drinking age .<-->O
Those laws have saved an estimated 20,000 lives in the past 20 years .<-->N
Yet safety advocates say politicians remain generally unwilling to raise the driving age .<-->N
`` If this were forced on the states , it would not be accepted very welShould the driving age be raised to 18 ?<-->N
l , '' Harsha says .<-->N
`` What it usually takes for politicians to change their minds is a series of crashes involving young people .<-->N
When enough of those kind of things happen , then politicians are more likely to be open to other suggestions . ''<-->O
--------------------------------- 7Should the driving age be raised to 18 ?<-->N
YES On Dec. 29 , 2005 , four teenage boys from Chicago went out for a late-night drive and had a terrible accident .<-->N
The car spun out of control and struck several objects , including a giant light pole .<-->O
Two of the boys a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old were killed .<-->N
The driver of the car was just 16 .<-->N
After this tragic accident , thousands of people began asking what could be done to prevent this from happening again .<-->N
The answer is raising the driving age .<-->N
That 's why I introduced legislation to raise the driving age in Illinois from 16 to 18 .<-->N
I realize this idea is controversial , but I could not stand by and watch one more young person die because he or she was not quite ready to be behind the wheel .<-->O
All 50 states prohibit 16-year-olds from drinking alcohol , buying cigarettes , and purchasing handguns .<-->N
Yet somehow most states are willing to put them in charge of a car , which could potentially be a deadly weapon .<-->O
Between 1995 and 2004 , there were 30,917 fatalities in accidents that involved 15-to-17-year-old drivers , according to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety .<-->N
About a third of those deaths were the teen drivers themselves .<-->F
The rest were pedestrians , passengers , and people in cars that teenage drivers struck .<-->N
As an Illinois lawmaker , I can not sit back and watch more innocent lives be claimed because of lack of experience .<-->O
Raising the driving age may seem burdensome to parents and busy teens , but we have to remember that this is a proposal about safety , not convenience .<-->O
Representative John D'Amico Democrat , Illinois State Legislature NO If your neighbor robs a bank , should you go to jail ?<-->N
If your classmate gets in an accident , should your driver 's license be taken away ?<-->F
Of course not .<-->N
Neither situation is fair .<-->N
Raising the driving age will punish all young drivers for the mistakes of a few of their peers .<-->O
In this country we live by the principle of innocent until proven guilty .<-->O
Those who want to raise the driving age have labeled teens guilty before they 've gotten in an accident or before they 've even stepped into a car .<-->O
They believe that just because of your birth date , you are dangerous and must be punished by having your ability to drive taken from you .<-->O
Those who favor raising the driving age say that statistics show teenagers are more likely to get into accidents than adults .<-->O
What they do n't say is that statistics also show that men of all ages are 77 percent more likely to kill someone while driving than women .<-->O
If people want to save lives by raising the driving age , then how about saving lives by allowing only women to drive ?<-->N
Except raising the driving age wo n't save lives .<-->N
Studies show that it is inexperience , not age , that causes accidents .<-->N
Raising the driving age will just create inexperienced , accident-prone drivers at 18 instead of 16 .<-->O
Teens need the ability to drive just as much as anyone else to get to school , to get to work , to get to sports or band practice , or just to go out with their friends .<-->O
Cars are necessary for mobility in this country .<-->N
Taking that away is a large disruption to the liveAlexander Sostarecz : Raise driving age to 18 when teens are more responsibles of teen-agers for no good reason .<-->O
--------------------- 8 .<-->N
Alexander Sostarecz : Raise driving age to 18 when teens are more responsible In the teenage life , everything is about freedom , getting away from home and being independent .<-->O
Should there be a limit to this freedom ?<-->N
Teens follow a common trend today of loving the freedom of being able to drive .<-->O
However , this could be a bad thing .<-->N
In the first six months of 2012 , deaths of drivers ages 16 and 17 increased 19 percent compared to the same period the year before .<-->N
Why is this ?<-->N
There are plenty of things to blame ; however , I blame the lack of training .<-->O
Pennsylvania laws allow teens at age 16 to receive their permit , which allows them to drive with a licensed person .<-->N
Additionally , to get their license , they have to have at least 60 hours of driving , 10 hours of which are in bad weather .<-->N
Even after this , permit drivers must take a driving test to determine if they will get licensed .<-->O
Most people would think that at this point anyone who passes all of these requirements should be an adept driver .<-->O
However , I notice sometimes how bad teen drivers can be .<-->N
Many times , I have watched some of them pull out of the parking lot at my school , and I wonder how they got their license when they drive so recklessly .<-->O
At age 16 , most people are not fully mature .<-->O
Many teens do not realize that their reflexes and hand-eye coordination skills are not fully developed yet , and they can end up getting in accidents .<-->N
Additionally , the biggest problem also the most well-known is the use of the cellphone .<-->N
Many teenagers use a cellphone to keep in contact with friends and tend to use it while driving .<-->N
Although many awareness campaigns to stop texting and driving exist , it 's impossible to completely stop it .<-->O
In addition to the driver risking his life , he could also be risking another 's life , as students often carpool to school or to other places .<-->N
If the driving age were pushed to 18 , teens would have more time to learn about driving safely .<-->N
The main arguments for teenagers driving at 16 are that they need a car to go to work and that they need freedom .<-->O
But these issues can easily be resolved by teens taking buses to get to work .<-->N
The argument of not having enough freedom without a car is hard to come to terms with .<-->O
Many teens still get driven by their parents to go to friends ' houses or anywhere else , but some teens have parents who may not be able to drive them places .<-->O
Therefore , the easiest way to solve the problem of freedom would be to use public transportation or an older driver .<-->O
If the driving age was raised to 18 , roads would be safer and teenage death rates from car accidents would be lower .<-->O
All that we have to do is raise the driving age for safer roads and safer teenagers .<-->N
----------------- 9 .<-->F
Should The Driving Age Be Raised To 18 ?<-->N
Is 16 too young to drive ?<-->N
If you re 16 .<-->N
you probably think not .<-->N
But it s those over 16 adults like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety s Adrian Lund who will get to be the deciders on this one .<-->O
Lund and some others want to push the age at which a person can get their first driver s license to 17 or even 18 .<-->N
Of course , it s all about safety .<-->N
Lund a professional nag who heads an organization of nags says that teenage drivers are a menace to themselves and others and wants to use the billy stick of the federal government -LRB- via withheld highway funds -RRB- to compel states to raise their legal driving age just as the billy stick of federal money was used to impose the 55 mph speed limit , virtual Prohibition of alcohol and primary enforcement seat belt laws .<-->O
This time , it s not merely for the children it actually involves them .<-->O
And Lund is partially right .<-->N
Teenagers do get into more than their fair share of wrecks .<-->N
But is this due to their age or their lack of training/experience ?<-->N
There are some very young pro drivers from NHRA to NASCAR .<-->N
Maybe not sixteen-year-olds , but not far removed .<-->N
At 15 or 16 , some of these kids are better drivers than most of us will ever be .<-->O
What to make of this fact ?<-->N
Granted , these are exceptional kids but the point s not invalid : Experience and training probably mean a whole lot more than age as such .<-->O
Will raising the age to 17 or 18 give a kid more experience or less ?<-->N
Maybe the age at which we begin to train kids to drive should be lowered , not raised .<-->N
Does it make more or less sense to toss a kid with zero hours behind the wheel a set of car keys at 17 or 18 , when he is inches way from being legally free of any parental oversight whatsoever ?<-->O
Maybe it would make more sense to begin teaching kids how to drive around 14 or 15 easing them into it gradually , and with supervision so that by the time they are 17 or 18 they have three or four years of experience behind them .<-->O
That s actually the way it used to be done , until public institutions such as public schools took over from parents and the whole process became bureaucratized and officialized but with less than stellar results .<-->O
Driving is , after all , a skill like any other ; it is not mastered overnight or after a few weeks of classroom instruction and a couple of hours in the seat .<-->N
Logic says start them sooner , not later .<-->N
But that would make sense and making sense is what IIHS is not all about .<-->O
It exists to harp over problems often directly ginned up by its own propaganda .<-->N
Mandatory buckle-up laws are an example of this .<-->N
Ditto the neo-Prohibitionist crusade that has gone way beyond a legitimate effort to deal with drunk drivers that now mercilessly prosecutes people with trace amounts of alcohol in their system as little as .06 or even .04 BAC , the level an average person can reach after having had a single glass of wine over dinner .<-->O
But I digress .<-->N
The other half of the equation when it comes to new/teenage drivers is proper instruction .<-->N
What we do in this country for the most part is woefully inadequate .<-->O
Many parents set poor examples or are simply ill-equipped to properly instruct their kids in safe/competent driving .<-->O
Ditto the so-called schools -LRB- especially those offered by the public schools -RRB- and the at-best cursory testing done by most DMVs before that first license is issued .<-->O
We don t really show kids how to drive especially how to handle emergency , such as a slide on black ice .<-->O
Instead , we chant cant at them that s obvious BS , such as speed kills the driving equivalent of the BS about marihuana that s peddled to them in Just Say No sessions .<-->O
Kids are smart enough to see through this but immature enough to then regard everything they re taught by adults as BS .<-->O
This is dangerous .<-->N
Far better to really teach them and to be honest with them .<-->O
I d be ready to lay serious cash on the table to bet Lund that if you took an average 14 or 15 year old and had him or her trained by an expert instructor and properly supervised for a year or two before a provisional license was granted after which the kid would still be monitored and quickly reined in at the first sign of reckless or incompetent behavior the whole teenage driver thing would just disappear .<-->O
Problem is , there s no money in that .<-->N
Finding solutions to problems is not what IIS wants .<-->F
IIHS wants crusades that never end .<-->N
Just like MADD ; just like politicians .<-->O
Just like the whole lot of them .<-->N

Should the legal driving age be raised ?<-->F
Will increasing the minimum driving age make our roads any safer ?<-->N
As the situation currently stands , 17-year-olds are able to acquire a driving license .<-->N
It is now under discussion whether they should be taken off our roads , and licenses should only be provided to those of 18-years or older in order to reduce the amount of deaths that occur through dangerous driving .<-->O
Instead of 17-year-olds being able to hold a full driving license , it is possible that they will have a year s worth of training time , taking them to the age of 18 .<-->O
It is thought that this could prevent thousands of deaths and injuries on the road each year .<-->N
The year-long learning period would benefit those learning to drive by equipping them with skills for driving in various conditions .<-->O
Many young drivers pass their test with as little as six months of training , meaning they may not experience driving in the winter months , when the roads are icy and the evenings are dark , during their lessons , and may pass without the necessary knowledge for driving in these circumstances .<-->O
Jamie Coles , an 18-year-old attending the Rushcliffe Sixth Form , learned to drive when he was 17 .<-->N
He said , on the subject : I don t think that raising the age would make any difference because it s about experience ; someone who started driving at the age of 18 would have the same amount of experience as someone who started at 17 .<-->O
If I hadn t been able to drive until I was 18 , it wouldn t have made a huge difference to my life , but I wouldn t have had as much freedom as I did , and being able to drive has allowed me to travel more .<-->O
Statistics show that the number of collisions amongst drivers under the age of 25 is on the increase .<-->N
Around 27 % of teenage male drivers crash within their first year of holding a license .<-->N
However , does a person s ability to drive really depend that much on their age , or is it more to do with their character ?<-->O
Obviously new drivers may want to flaunt their skills to their friends , with dangerous driving due to showing off being a major cause of accidents , but surely new drivers are likely to be more cautious than experienced ones and pay more attention to what they re doing .<-->O
What they have learned is still fresh in their minds , while motorists who have been driving for a long time could be overconfident and careless .<-->O
Amy Byard is a 17-year-old driver who agrees with Jamie s view and doesn t think that age is a factor in driving .<-->O
I think that all new drivers , whatever their age , are going to be at risk .<-->O
It s more of a confidence issue , rather than an age-related one .<-->O
Without being able to drive I would struggle to get around ; I wouldn t be able to drive to college .<-->O
This would be yet another regulation that the government is throwing at young people .<-->N
Dangerous drivers can be found across the generations and not just amongst young drivers .<-->N
Maybe a 12-month training period would give new drivers time for the initial thrill of driving to wear off and give them more experience , but how much difference will prolonging driving independently by one year make ?<-->O
Is it not possible that 18-year-olds will find themselves in the same situation that 17-year-olds are in now ?<-->N
Another possibility is that more teenagers will turn to mopeds as a method of transport , potentially leading to more road-related deaths .<-->O
Perhaps to make a real difference to road death figures , people should be tested regularly , to cut down on the number of older drivers who pose a risk on the roads .<-->O

When used , they form the basis of a school 's dress code .<-->N
Traditionally school uniforms have been largely subdued and professional .<-->N
-LSB- citation needed -RSB- Boys ' uniforms often consist of dark short or long trousers and light-colored shirt , often with a tie .<-->N
Girls ' uniforms vary greatly between countries and schooling systems , but typically consist of a dress or a blouse worn either with a skirt or culottes or under a pinafore ; some countries allow girls to wear trousers .<-->O
The use of a blazer or suit-like jacket for either gender is also fairly common , especially in countries with relatively cold weather .<-->O
While some countries have school uniforms that are essentially standard in all schools using it , others have each school with an individual uniform , varying in and often making use of badges .<-->N

As many as one in eight American public schools have been implementing this policy .<-->N
While there are many advocates for the continuous usage of school uniforms , there is another side that rallies against it .<-->N
You ll find out in the list below .<-->N
First , a Brief History of Uniforms Although the uniform requirement has just been recently imposed , uniforms have been in existence for several centuries now .<-->O
The first documented usage of a standard garment in education was in 1222 , where students were required to wear a cappa clausa or a robe-like outfit .<-->N
Fast forward to 16th century England , students of the Christ Hospital Boarding School became the fathers of the modern school uniform .<-->N
These children wore blue cassocks and yellow stockings , to mirror the look of the clergymen who looked after them .<-->N
Up to now , this uniform is still in use , making it the oldest uniform in history .<-->O
School Uniforms in the United States While the English have long been using uniforms , the United States was quite loose with the uniform system .<-->O
Only the students of private and parochial schools were first required to wear uniforms at least until 1987 .<-->N
Maryland and Washington DC were the first states to implement uniforms in public schools .<-->N
Later on , other states followed suit .<-->N
Despite such changes , all states are not compelled to require uniforms .<-->N
However , more and more school districts are going against this ruling .<-->N
If your school directors are thinking of doing so , then make sure to let them read these top 10 reasons why school uniforms are a bad idea .<-->O
Uniforms Only Fuel Commercial Interests Sad as it might seem , uniforms are only stimulating commercial interests .<-->O
They are not solving the concerns that they are geared for .<-->N
In fact , numerous companies treat the uniform system as a major source of revenue .<-->O
After all , Americans shell out a whopping $ 1 billion dollars every year !<-->N
Because of the limitless profits that go with uniforms , it comes as no surprise why more and more corporations are lobbying for the requirement of these homogenized outfits .<-->O
Institutions such as Lands End are funding marketing efforts specifically targeted towards public schools .<-->N
Similar institutions are also subsidizing studies that advocate the effectiveness of uniforms .<-->N
So if you read an article that says uniforms are beneficial , there is a huge probability that it is biased .<-->O
With that being said , it s fair to say that such institutions are supporting studies on uniforms not because of concern , but because of the impact it has on their businesses .<-->O
It can be said that they are selling their uniforms not because the students need it , but because they can earn lots from it .<-->N
Why rally behind a cause that will not really benefit you or your child , for that matter ?<-->O
While revenues that come from uniforms stimulate the American economy , they don t support it the right way .<-->O
Consumers sadly , the low-income ones suffer a lot because of these commercial interests .<-->O
You wouldn t want the poor to get the poorer , and the rich to get richer especially if it s the wrong , selfish way .<-->O
Although it isn t obvious , uniforms do fuel wicked commercial interests , and they should be stopped before more hard-wasted money is lost .<-->O
Uniforms can be Detrimental to Adult Development The path to adult development is honed throughout the duration of early schooling .<-->N
However , your transition towards adulthood can be hindered with uniforms .<-->F
Since it is mandatory , you are not given the chance to decide for yourself , which is one of the hallmarks of adulthood .<-->N
You know you are an adult when you are given the freedom to choose whether you like this or that .<-->O
When you were young , you know you are not an adult yet because your parents -LRB- aka the adults -RRB- made the decision for you .<-->N
However , when you are restricted to wearing uniforms in school , you are denied the opportunity to make decisions for yourself .<-->N
After all , you do not have a choice because the others have already made it for you .<-->N
Although this issue might be seen as a simple one , it can have a huge toll in a child s transition to adulthood .<-->O
Because he was not able to make choices when he was young , he will most likely be unprepared for the rigors of the adult world .<-->O
This dilemma is rightly reflected in Erik Erikson s stages of psychosocial development .<-->N
The stage of adolescence is seen as a crucial one , for in this phase the person asks who he is and what he can be .<-->N
Most importantly , he can either develop identity or role confusion .<-->N
Clothing is considered as one of the means of building an identity , and without the freedom to choose , the development of such as well as his transition to adulthood can be severely dampened .<-->O
Uniforms can affect one s Self-Image Uniforms aim to give everybody a homogenous look , right ?<-->O
Instead of improving a student s self-image because he looks just like the others , it actually does the opposite .<-->O
Students have different weights , body types and heights .<-->N
Whenever one looks at himself in the mirror , he depreciates his self-image because he feels like he doesn t look his best .<-->O
Unfortunately , this case is often seen in girls , who feel embarrassed when they go to school in uniforms .<-->N
According to development psychologists , ladies have the huge tendency to compare how they look in uniforms .<-->O
This is especially the case when the student sees herself to have a curvy or plus-size body .<-->N
This also happens to girls who deem themselves very short or very tall .<-->O
I can go on and on about how uniforms affect self-image , but the most concrete evidence proves to be the results of a study conducted by researchers from the Arizona State University .<-->O
The paper , entitled Public School Uniforms : Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence , School Climate , and Student Self-Perceptions , shows that students who are not required to wear school uniforms demonstrated higher self-perception scores .<-->N
That means these students have better views of self-image , compared to those who have to suffer the pains of wearing uniforms to school .<-->O
Uniforms Actually Attract Bullies If you thought that requiring all students to wear uniforms can lessen the chances of bullying , you are dead wrong !<-->O
In fact , it can actually increase the incidence of bullying , especially in school districts where violence rates are soaring .<-->O
A 1999 study conducted by experts from Texas Southern University showed that bullying incidents increased by as much as 12 % , after the implementation of mandatory uniform wearing .<-->N
Echoing this sentiment is a 2007 study published in the Southwest Journal of Criminal Justice .<-->N
According to the research , assaults increased by as much as 14 incidences yearly , right after the introduction of school uniforms .<-->O
A similar finding was discovered by the Office of Education , Evaluation , and Management of the Miami-Dade County .<-->N
Violence , especially in the middle schools , increased by a hundred fold after the students were required to wear uniforms .<-->N
Simply put , research shows that uniforms do not actually stop bullying .<-->N
People think that these can stop the violence , but they actually don t. Even when everybody s wearing the same thing , a student s distinct personality will still stand out .<-->O
Although clothes serve as a primary basis for violence and bullying , bullies eventually find another way to show their status that they are still better than their contemporaries .<-->O
According to academician Tony Volk , an expert on bullying , There is no evidence in bullying literature that supports a reduction in violence due to school uniforms .<-->N
Even minus the uniform , he adds that bullies can come up with other reasons that can justify violence and aggression towards their fellow students .<-->O
Uniforms are Boring !<-->N
Whatever way you look at it , homogeneity is definitely boring .<-->O
Seeing the same thing over and over again can be a ghastly sight for most .<-->N
The fact that uniforms are boring is a definite reason why requiring it in schools is a bad idea .<-->O
There are many reasons why uniforms boring , and I could go on and on .<-->N
But I m not writing a novel , so I ll make my reasons short and sweet .<-->O
First , uniforms are boring because of their colors .<-->N
More often than not , uniforms come in the most tedious of colors .<-->N
It s always navy blue , green , khaki , black and other dull colors .<-->N
Pro-uniforms say these clothes help prepare the children for their future occupations .<-->N
The last I checked I was allowed to wear lively clothes at work -LRB- as long as they are respectable-looking , of course . -RRB-<-->O
Another reason why uniforms suck is the patterns .<-->N
It s always checkered or plaid , if you are lucky enough that your uniform does not come in a single block color .<-->O
And to further add insult to injury , you have to wear the same , boring day every freaking school day .<-->O
Could I get an amen on this ?<-->N
School can be boring at times so why require students to wear uniforms that are just as -LRB- if not more than -RRB- boring ?<-->O
If we want our kids to enjoy school no matter how hard the lessons might be a great start would be to let them wear clothes that they ll be happy in .<-->O
Uniforms can be Uncomfortable There are so many reasons why uniforms are a bad idea , and one that most of us could relate to is the fact that it can be so darn uncomfortable .<-->O
I can hardly find a uniform-wearer who says that she feels cozy and snug in her boring attire .<-->O
Short skirts can sometimes be too short , that a gust of wind can easily expose your underpants .<-->O
Some uniforms are made from unpleasant fabrics that will make you itch from the first class to the last class .<-->O
Some are so badly-designed that they can make the wearer look bigger or pudgier .<-->N
Yes , there are so many things that can make uniforms so horrendously uncomfortable .<-->O
Perhaps the worst thing about uncomfortable uniforms is the fact that it can actually get in the way of learning .<-->O
You focus more on your uniform , instead of what you need to learn at school .<-->O
Let me give you a scenario .<-->N
Say you have a short skirt .<-->N
More often than not , you will end up tugging your skirt so that your privates are not revealed for the world to see .<-->N
This is especially the case when you are sitting down .<-->N
Since you are more concerned about your uniform , you will not be able to absorb the things that the teacher has just said .<-->O
Instead of helping you out , your uniform can actually get in the way of learning .<-->O
So if you ask me about , it shouldn t be mandatory .<-->N
Uniforms can be Costly Those who are in favor of uniforms believe that they are cheaper alternatives , because the students have to wear them every day .<-->O
That is actually a point of contention , as uniforms are very costly too !<-->O
In fact , Americans spend about $ 249 on uniforms yearly .<-->N
When you compound all the people that have to buy school uniforms , it totals to $ 1 billion annually .<-->N
That s the cost of the Chicago Cubs , LA Lakers , and the Toronto Maple Leafs -LRB- each team , of course . -RRB-<-->F
Heck , you can buy the Solomon Islands for $ 1 billion .<-->F
Sadly , the spending does not stop there .<-->N
The kids are continuously growing , so that means they could outgrow their uniforms anytime soon .<-->O
In some institutions , the uniforms are changed when students transition to middle school , junior high or senior high .<-->N
So that s $ 249 -LRB- even more -RRB- every time there s a need to change uniforms or buy bigger ones .<-->O
Although the cost is viewed reasonable by middle-class or well-to-do families , the cost can be a burden for the lower-class families .<-->N
This is especially the case for those who turn to public schools for free education .<-->N
They thought that they can provide their kids with free education , but it turns out they have to spend some anyway .<-->O
The additional costs are on the rise now , since more and more public school districts are now requiring their students to wear uniforms .<-->N
With that being said , uniforms are sometimes costlier than civilian clothing .<-->F
In the midst of recession , every penny counts .<-->N
So instead of buying expensive uniform , why not let the children wear what they already have ?<-->N
Uniforms Encourage Conformity instead of Personality Children are always taught to break free and stand out .<-->O
But with uniforms , the schools are actually lobbying for the opposite .<-->N
Uniforms actually force students to kowtow to the rules of conformity .<-->N
After all , a pupil needs to wear something that is prescribed for everybody , not something that expresses his individuality .<-->N
People who are for uniforms say that it promotes social conformity , so the less-to-do don t have to be pressured to keep up with their well-off contemporaries .<-->N
Unfortunately , it does not work that way .<-->N
They still are forced to spend because the school requires their children to wear costly uniforms .<-->N
They might also say that students can express their personalities in other ways , by way of accessories , purses , or a new hairstyle .<-->N
News Flash : some institutions prohibit it too .<-->N
And for those who don t , such can create disparity .<-->N
In an effort to express individuality , students will struggle to wear the newest trends , which are often expensive .<-->O
Again , it is a massive blow to the family s finances .<-->N
But there are more problems with conformity than just the economic burden .<-->O
The homogeneity that uniforms promote can dampen the students creativity and artistic growth .<-->N
Someone who is used to looking like the others will have no drive to express his personality .<-->O
As such , the student might end up just blending with the society , instead of making his mark in the world .<-->O
Uniforms create conformists , not insightful minds and intuitive thinkers .<-->O
Think of all the brilliant ideas we stand to lose in the future .<-->O
Uniforms Violate the First Amendment of the US Constitution The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees one the freedom of religion , assembly , and right to petition .<-->O
Most importantly , it assures a citizen s freedom to expression .<-->O
Unfortunately , this is inherently violated by requiring the students to wear uniforms .<-->N
Freedom of expression is not just about saying what you want to say , it s also about seeking and imparting ideas , regardless of limits and boundaries .<-->O
Expressing your ideologies , beliefs and philosophies , unfortunately , are hindered by school uniforms .<-->N
That s because you are forced to wear something you don t believe in .<-->N
You are no longer given a chance to express your ideas , which you can impart simply by choosing the clothes you like to wear .<-->N
As far as I know , we live in a free world in a free country -LRB- unless you re in North Korea , of course .<-->O
And if you are , I m happy that you were able to access the internet ! -RRB-<-->N
We have the right to voice our preferences and beliefs .<-->O
If wearing a unique brand of clothing is one way for us to do so , then why should the authorities hamper us from expressing ourselves individually ?<-->O
People don t take this seriously , that uniforms violate the Constitution .<-->O
But if this happens on another platform , it would be immediately tagged as a clear and direct violation of the First Amendment .<-->O
As the Star-Spangled Banner says , this is the land of the free .<-->N
If students are deprived of freedom of expression by requiring them to wear uniforms then the United States no longer proves to be the land of the free anymore .<-->O
Simply Put , Uniforms are Generally Disliked !<-->N
If only Facebook had a dislike button , mandatory uniforms would receive the thumbs down from students all over the globe .<-->O
That s because no student likes uniforms !<-->N
You can search every corner in the world and no pupil would say that he loves his uniform .<-->N
There have been numerous polls made to determine the acceptance of school uniforms , and most of them show that students are against them .<-->O
Take the case of the Harford County Public School students , wherein 87.9 % are in strong disfavor of the mandatory uniform system .<-->O
The parents of school children feel the same way as well .<-->N
According to the Rasmussen Reports , 47 % of parents are against school uniforms , compared to the 41 % who are in favor of school dresses .<-->O
12 % still remain undecided on the issue .<-->N
So why are uniforms despised by learners and their parents as well ?<-->N
There are many reasons why , and we have enumerated most of them .<-->N
Let me repeat it again for those who still don t get the drift that school uniforms are a terrible idea .<-->O
Uniforms fuel commercial interests , and they are detrimental to adult development .<-->N
They affect self-image , and even attract bullying and violence .<-->N
In terms are usage , uniforms prove to be uncomfortable and costly .<-->O
They can be very boring to wear and look at as well .<-->O
Apart from being generally disliked , uniforms are a direct violation to the first amendment of the US Constitution .<-->N
I can go on and on , but these do sum up the reasons why school uniforms are a bad idea .<-->N
Final Words While some studies show that school uniforms have numerous benefits , there are just as many reasons why requiring students to wear them is a bad idea .<-->O
For one , it only fuels commercial interests .<-->N
Companies that will benefit from the profits are actually spending a lot on marketing campaigns , as well as researches that prove uniforms to be advantageous .<-->O
Secondly , uniforms can be detrimental to adult development .<-->N
Impeding one s freedom to choose can take a toll on his transition to adult life .<-->N
Thirdly , uniforms can negatively affect a student s self-image .<-->N
Uniforms fit people differently .<-->N
As in the case of girls , who think of themselves badly because their uniforms don t fit them well .<-->O
Fourthly , uniforms actually attract bullies !<-->O
The staggering results of numerous researches show that they do little to curb violence in school .<-->O
In terms of personal style , uniforms are a bad idea because they are boring .<-->O
Imagine wearing the same thing over and over again until you graduate .<-->N
Apart from being boring , uniforms are highly uncomfortable as well .<-->O
Ugly fabrics and predetermined lengths can make the wearer feel uneasy , and in the end he might focus on his uniform rather than the lesson at hand .<-->O
The high cost is another reason why uniforms should be banned .<-->O
Instead of simply getting free public school education , parents are forced to spend as much as $ 249 every year .<-->O
In terms of personal development , uniforms promote conformity rather than individuality .<-->O
The homogeneity that results in this can get in the way of the student s creativity and artistic freedom .<-->N
Most importantly , the ruling on uniforms violates the First Amendment of the US Constitution .<-->N
It disregards the person s freedom of expression , because he is not able to show his ideologies , and philosophies concerning clothing .<-->O
Last but not the least , school uniforms are a bad idea because they are generally disliked .<-->O
If the students don t like them , why should we force them to wear these garments anyway ?<-->O
--------------------------------------- 3 .<-->N
School uniform is an essential part of school life .<-->N
School uniform should not be banned , because of money .<-->N
Our economic circumstances can have great affect , and more often than not , those with less money and therefore less desirable clothes are frequently subjected to various forms of prejudice and discrimination , exclusion and even ostracism , especially in schools .<-->O
Wearing less expensive less fashionable clothes , different clothing from everyone else creates division , which school uniform can avoid .<-->O
To be set apart and look different , in any way from everybody else almost certainly makes people targets for bullying , especially in schools .<-->O
Young children who do not know the effect of bullying will always pick on the child who does not look the same Also , because school uniform allows you to easily identify someone as a student of a specific school , if someone from another school physically or verbally abuses someone or done something bad , they are able to take the situation into your own hands and find the school they are from , and contact Principal of the school and inform them of their students behaviour .<-->O
Anther reason is that in a school excursion if the student get lost the method of identification would we easy because everyone with the school uniform is from the same school and their uniform would guarantee they could be easily to find for a adult or police .<-->O
The biggest deterrent to a healthy school climate may be the lack of discipline and respect .<-->O
The absence of a well-disciplined student body is a major problem in many school districts -LRB- Curriculum Review , 1994 . -RRB-<-->O
This is true in suburbs as well as cities .<-->N
Too many students are preoccupied with how they look and what they wear , rather than their studies .<-->O
Schools have become a stage for the latest fashion parade , deflecting away the attention from learning and achieving educational goals -LRB- LaPoint , 1993 . -RRB-<-->N
School uniforms can create a sense of togetherness in a school building .<-->N
This sense of togetherness can convey to the tax-paying public that schools are well managed because the students are under control due to their dress -LRB- Peters , 1996 . -RRB-<-->O
There is more of a socio-economic balance among the students with the wearing of uniforms .<-->N
Students who attempt to make fashion statements through the wearing of designer clothing are virtually neutralized .<-->N
School spirit is enhanced because a feeling of togetherness is created .<-->O
The gap between the `` haves '' and the `` have-nots '' is narrowed due to uniforms -LRB- LaPoint , 1993 . -RRB-<-->N
Uniforms create social harmony due to the uniform look of similarly clothed students -LRB- Kaiser , 1985 . -RRB-<-->O
Proponents of school uniforms claim that school safety would be improved through a mandatory uniform policy .<-->O
Gang type clothing would be eliminated .<-->N
Crimes such as theft of expensive clothing or footwear would be substantially reduced -LRB- McDaniel , 1996 . -RRB-<-->O
Intruders in school buildings could easily be spotted if all the students were wearing a similar style of dress -LRB- Forbes , 1994 . -RRB- .<-->N
Supporters of uniforms contend that the wearing of school uniforms affects students perception of school climate .<-->N
Students feel as though they are part of a team , and according to Keith King of the University of Cincinnati , `` The number one protective factor against school violence is having students feel connected to their school and that they fit in . ''<-->O
-LRB- Wingert , 1999 . -RRB-<-->N
Student respect for teachers , administrators , and especially for each other would be improved with the institution of a mandatory uniform dress code .<-->O
The sense of togetherness that a uniform policy would instill in a school can not be overstated .<-->O
If students were all dressed in a similar fashion , the `` playing field would be leveled . ''<-->N
Each and every student would be similar .<-->N
The students would spend more time concentrating on their school work , rather than on what their friends or they are wearing .<-->O
There would be less ridicule of students due to their inability to dress in a style acceptable to the `` in-crowd '' -LRB- Manual on School Uniforms , 2000 . -RRB-<-->O
With the high cost of clothing today , school uniforms can lift a financial burden from students families .<-->N
The cost of designer clothing , and especially footwear , is expensive -LRB- Timely Tips : School Uniforms Debate , 2000 . -RRB-<-->N
School uniforms can be purchased at one-third the cost of most school outfits that are purchased in department stores .<-->N
Three school uniforms can be purchased for under a hundred dollars .<-->N
School uniforms would assist students and parents in other ways .<-->N
Students would learn to appreciate the elimination of so many choices when getting dressed for a school day .<-->O
Students would not be tardy for school as often because of the indecision about what to wear in the mornings -LRB- Showalter , 1997 . -RRB-<-->O
Parents would know that what a student puts on in the morning is what they would wear at school .<-->O
Students sometimes change to other outfits once their parents leave for work .<-->N
Uniforms promote a `` down to business '' atmosphere because kids view them as work clothes rather than play clothes .<-->O
Therefore , they take school more seriously than before the uniform code was instituted -LRB- Kaiser , 1985 . -RRB-<-->N
At the very minimum , schools should address the issue of a dress code .<-->N
It is not necessary for the code to be rigid .<-->N
But it is necessary for the dress code to be reasonable and fair .<-->O
The best interests of students and their welfare should be addressed .<-->O
There is no magical solution to the stopping of school violence and the improvement of discipline .<-->N
Much of this answer lies in the chemistry that exists in a school between students and staff .<-->N
Uniforms might appear to the public as the cure-all for a schools ills , but the ultimate decision on behavioral change is made by the children themselves .<-->O
From http://www.buzzle.com/articles/benefits-of-school-uniforms.html 1 .<-->N
A school uniform makes it easier for the school authorities to recognize students belonging to their school .<-->N
It also makes it somewhat tougher for those that don t belong to slip in ; unless , of course , they go to all the trouble of buying a uniform that fits .<-->O
A school uniform also saves the school administrators from having to police what the students wear .<-->N
There are no daily battles regarding what s appropriate or not for school .<-->N
A school uniform apparently also saves students from putting their fashion tastes before their learning requirements .<-->O
When they don t have to spend time wondering what to wear and how to make a fashion statement , they can devote more time to getting an education .<-->N
Theoretically , that is .<-->N
Wearing the same type of dress reduces social snobbery and peer pressure in educational institutions .<-->N
It is also supposed to reduce incidents of bullying and theft .<-->N
How do you pick on someone for wearing the same dress as yourself ?<-->N
Why would you steal a pair of shoes you both have and can afford ?<-->O
I suppose there are ways and there are reasons , but fewer .<-->N
School uniforms cramp the style of gang members .<-->N
They have to recognize each other by names and faces instead of by flaunting aggressively painted jackets , T-shirts with obscene messages , clunky jewelry , and things like that .<-->O
Instead of my gang and your gang , they also have to think in terms of our school .<-->N
It s a hard life .<-->N
On the brighter side , it helps them to live another day and go on to survive in college .<-->N
A school uniform can instill a sense of discipline and community feeling .<-->O
This naturally reduces incidents of violence .<-->N
Students can come to school without worrying about personal safety .<-->N
Teachers don t have to double as guards , and can concentrate on teaching .<-->N
Many children and some parents believe that school uniform should be banned because they are too expensive and that they should wear their favourite clothes but this not actually what school uniform all about .<-->O
I , and so do many other parents and children , believe that school uniform should not be banned because children look smart in uniform , reduces costly fashion show competitions and also saves parents time from choosing which clothes their child should wear .<-->O
This is because children look the same in school uniform ; uniform does not cause bullying and saves our parents money .<-->O
School uniform also represents the school , gives the school a good name around the country and also saves parents time from choosing which clothes their child should wear .<-->O
Therefore , I personally believe that children should continue to wear school uniform ---------------------- 5 .<-->O

Some may argue that by having a uniform you remove the pressure to keep up with the latest fashions , that it removes the barrier between the classes and that it shows a pride in the school .<-->O
Others argue that it can lead to ridicule and that by abolishing uniform it allows a freedom of expression .<-->O

Worthing In many years of experience , I 've observed that the level of a student 's academic achievement and their behaviour both in and out of school is reflected in their appearance .<-->N

shows good discipline Sinead '' ... by having a uniform you remove the pressure to keep up with the latest fashions , that it removes the barrier between the classes and that it shows a pride in the school ... '' Few may realize it , but this argument to mantain school uniform policies actually has a few cons that need to be considered .<-->O
In many schools , students are actually teased about ` how they wear ' their school uniforms .<-->N
Unless you have your tie really short , your shirt hanging out and your blazer 's buttons perpetually undone , you 'll get teased and mocked .<-->N
Sure , school uniforms allow students to be indentified more easily if they were to become lost during a school trip , or be involved in a crime , but they usually tend to make the student wearing them uncomfortable and forbid expression of one 's self .<-->O
Also , parents would not have to fritter away all their hard-earned money upon frequently expensive items of clothing that are regarded as requisites .<-->N
My own parents had to spend between 80 to 90 on my own school uniform !<-->N
Consider this , some families may not be in possession of money needed to make such purchases .<-->N
Often , they may have to buy second-hand school uniform items , and the wearers of these purchases may very well end up the victims of teasing and bullying .<-->O
It 's difficult to say whether the school uniform policy should be abolished .<-->O
If it were to be maintained , then it might be a good idea to re-design school uniforms .<-->O
They should be .<-->N
Reasonably priced .<-->F
Pleasing to the eye .<-->F
Comfortable for the wearers .<-->N
Should allow students to express themselves to at least ` some ' degree .<-->N
rainbow , devon i think we shud get rid of uniforms cos evry1 says they stop u from getting teased bout not being cool , but people get teased @ sch anyway , uniform makes no difference .<-->O
there hav been studies dun 2 prove dat kids wrk betta wen theyre not in uniform and wen ur in college/uni ur onna hav 2 get used 2 wearing ur own clothes and being judged by wot u wear - at 16 u dont suddenly become responsibe enough 2 b confident bout ur appearance - why not spend ur whole childhood wearing ur own clothes @ sch , then it wouldnt b an issue ny more .<-->O
BBC DEVION HOST So Jim of Plymouth thinks that all youngsters are `` foul-mouthed and ill-mannered , semi-literate '' .<-->N
Let 's keep the tone of this message board friendly - but it would be good to see some reasoned debate as to why you think he is right or wrong ... over to you :--RRB- jim b - plymouth What difference does it make whether you go to school at all , no matter what you 're wearing ?<-->O
The exams are all dumbed down so you can all pass and beef up those phoney government education statistics , you 're foul-mouthed and ill-mannered , semi-literate , and only capable academically of going on to `` university '' to `` read '' some Micky Mouse subject like David Beckham Studies or some similar nonsense .<-->O
Dress in a bin liner if you like - it 'll make no difference !<-->N
stacey wisconsin i hate school uniforms because when your in high school you will not know what to wear on your first day of scool niki deacon u.k uniforms are o.k.every one looks the same and smart.it also shows what skol u come from.i like my uni Jess , New Zealand After reading meny of the comments I realised that most of u out there are just plain sulfish and rude .<-->O
I personally think that uniforms are a good thing I mean it brings u ta gether as a school an every one feels as though they belong an also it gives u an da school an identy a placeing in siciaty .<-->O
If we didnt have ta were uniforms the school would be shambles .<-->N
My sister hated wereing a uniform so mush mom let her move schools .<-->O
on her first day she came home crying cause she had no friends cause her cloths werent `` of the right fashion '' she blamed mom for not telling her that she needed to have labled cloths to be cool which got mom started an it all turned inta a heated arugement .<-->O
She now spends round an hour to an hour an a half getting ready in da morning just so she dont get teased at school by the boys an the so called `` populer rich kids '' who can afford all the latest laybled clothing .<-->O
I feel real sorry for her an others in that same situation .<-->O
I think u all need ta have a good think about this cause i admit that i to thought uniforms sucked now i think they 're great i take about 5 min to get ready in da morning .<-->O
Haveing a uniform that may be a bit ugly or uncomfortable is a good thing if its goona help stop fights an teasing between students who dont have the `` latest fashion '' cloths .<-->O
I would also like to say that our parents and there parents an so forth all had to were a uniform why should we not have to were one it would be destroying our heritage .<-->O
So i agree with the uniform it makes u all feel equal that no one is better than the other .<-->O
Go uniforms KK , from Nanaimo b.c. I go to NDSS and i think that are school needs uniforms !!<-->N
Alfonso Vargas ???????????????? I think school uniforms suck because they make us look like retards and like we are from the old times !<-->O
They are S-u-c-k Suck with a capital S !!!!!!!!!!!! holly , nz school uniforms suck , they make every1 feel the same i say we should get fid of them Rhys from witham I think it is a good thing not to have school uniform .<-->O
It does n't matter what you wear , people are still going to get bullied over `` having their top button done up '' , or `` having your shirt tucked in . ''<-->O
At my school , The John Bramston School , if we doo n't have our top buttons done up , our ties down to our navel or our shirts tucked into our trousers then we get detentions , but if we do have our top button done up etc. we get the mickey taken out of us .<-->O
It 's a lose-lose situation .<-->N
If we have to wear uniform we either have to face our parents with a detention or get the crap beaten out of us .<-->N
Uniforms are bad , full stop .<-->N
The Girls of St Wilfrids School , Exeter Hi we are from St Wilfrids School , which is just down the road from you radio Devon !<-->O
We have a horrible uniform !<-->N
it is a purple shirt with a grey pleated skirt , green blazer , black tights and green and purple tie .<-->N
All the girls have been trying to get a petitio 2 our head teacher to let the girls wear either balck or grey trousers but simply wont let it happen .<-->N
we ahve been trying for years please help us !!!<-->O
kunal america school is not for uniforms Tina Australia My daughter wears a uniform to school and I think it is great .<-->O
Girls can be so compeditive about their looks and even though they still can make changes to personalise themselves it has to be more subtle than wearing the latest fashion and rubbing it in the face of the other girls .<-->O
I think it is good to for the girls to wear a skirt as it gives them an identity different to the boys .<-->N
Also I would much rather she wears a short skirt in a safe environment like school than to do it out of school when there may not by someone there to help her if the wrong guy gets the wrong idea kate from totnes i go 2 kevicc - ie the school thats got no uniform that this whole discussion is about .<-->O
and basically it dont make one bit of difference , no one cares wat ppl wear , sum people go way OTT really caring wat they look like and sum dont .<-->O
but no 1 says nethin and no one cares with just get on with school .<-->N
ITS NOT A BIG DEAL !<-->N
uniform or no uniform school is exactly the same as its always been no1 is that immature to let sumthin dumb like clothes b an issue .<-->O
its not .<-->N
get over it guys Amy , Gateshead I think that when you get to high school , you should have the choice of what to wear .<-->O
When you are in primary school , it doesnt really matter what you wear because most children will wear whatever their parents put them in , but when you get to high school , you get your own identity and choose your own clothes .<-->O
with all the fashions , and the fact that teens can only wear what they choose on weekends , i think it is a waste of money on fashions .<-->O
if you could wear clothes that you choose at school , it would mean that more teens are free to follow the latest trends .<-->O
It could also cause bullying though because if some teens have the latest trends and others cant afford it , they might get picked on for not having the `` in '' clothes .<-->O
i do think that no school uniform is a very good idea though .<-->O
A Mum , Tamworth Sraffs School Uniform should be smart , modern , comfortable , flattering , inexpensive , not intrusive to school activities .<-->O
It should also be compulsary as It SHOULD enhance the teamspirit ethos of school life .<-->N
Also it is easier to get dressed in the morning if you do n't have to have long disussions about what to wear !<-->N
Megan if you think that a school uniform takes away your ` freedom of expression , ' then what you want to express is n't worth it .<-->O
find some other way -LRB- ie .<-->N
art , writing , music , math , science , etc -RRB- to `` express yourself . ''<-->F
what you wear does n't make you who you are .<-->N
Lois-Plymouth I think school uniform is a good idea as it stops us from choosing what to wear when we get up in the morning .<-->O
Also , when we wear it we have to behave ourselves and set an example .<-->N
rosie from okehampton college i think that you are all talking a load of rubbish.school uniforms are ment as a part of identie on who you are and where you are from.without them our schools would look tacky and disordaly .<-->O
you ave to wear some sort of uniform wen u go to work so y not start the trend now !!!!!!!!! sally - devon school uniform in our school isnt worth having as people always wear jeans an stuf n e way even if they get in trouble.the 6 form dont wear uniform , an people still get picked on even though every1 wears the same thing.we should be allowed to wear what we like .<-->O
alex what a load of brain washing julia , osnabr ck , germany would like school-uniform Lisa , Texas What you were expresses who you are .<-->N
Uniforms takes away `` Freedom of expressment '' or `` Freedom of Speech '' i think that uniforms would acually cause more problems , and people wouldnt pay attention in school .<-->O
they are are more worried about what they are wearing and how much they hate it , then what they need to learn .<-->O
Annie TGA NZ school uniforms are not kool , we dont get to show our individuality and people still judge you by your uniform !<-->O
Emma , Ireland Jodie wrote : >> i go to the 2nd highest school in England and the uniform is so inpracticle for the weather around the school !<-->N
i have to wear a pleated skirt which wiv a tiny breeze blows up so imagine wat happens on an extremely windy day !?<-->O
plus it is very cold in winter and the girls are not allowed to wear pants !<-->N
whereas schools which arnt high up on a hill can where pants , personally i think that is extremely unfair and i know that other people agree too !!<-->O
Melissa and Amber from Tgc , New Zealand We think the uniforms are ugly and uncomfortable but if we did n't have them you would be spending just as much money on clothes that you are going to wear during the week because you wo n't want to be wearing the same clothes every day .<-->O
Not wearing school uniform leads to fights and teasing between students because they might not have ` cool ' labelled clothing that other students have .<-->O
We agree with uniform and think it 's radical .<-->O
Kassie 4m Louisiana USA School uniforms should be banned .<-->N
I am 14 and a straight A student .<-->N
Uniforms do n't do anything good for us .<-->N
Since i have had to wear uniforms , things actually got worse .<-->O
People still clown other people because not all uniforms are `` cool '' .<-->N
For instance , we ca n't ever wear pants with rivets .<-->N
How is rivets going to stop us from learning ???? If you like uniforms then wear those instead .<-->N
Dont make everyone have to wear them .<-->N
It takes away our individuality and freedom .<-->N
Please consider everyones oponions .<-->N
Remember , these are students and their parents opinions here !!!!!! thanks !!!!!!!! REBECCA - V.W.C.D. - GUYANA UNIFORMS SHOULD NOT BE ABOLISHED SINCE IT MAKES EVERYONE WHO WEARS IT FEEL APART OF A BODY .<-->N
AND ALSO IT GIVES THEM A FORM OF IDENTITY.iT GIVES THEM LESS TROUBLE TO GET DRESSED IN THE MORNING HENCE WE DO N'T GO TO SCHOOL LATE AND MISS OUT ANYTHING IMPORTANT IN CLASSES .<-->N
AND ANOTHER THING IT MAKES THE STUDENTS WHO WEAR THEM FEEL EQUAL -- NOBODY 'S BETTER THAN ANYBODY .<-->F
IN THE CASE OF GUY .<-->N
EVERONE WEARS UNIFORMS EXCEPT UNIVERSITY STUDENTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Courtz TGA NZ Hey wat up all my m8s , i think uniforms are all gud bcoz then if you cant afford the l8est fashions or u hav a different style 2 everyone else then you cld get ridiculed and teased and thats not nice 2 face up 2 every day .<-->O
However , i think that my uniform is to strict bcoz u cant wear extra jewellery or things like that so it cld b cool if it was lke black skirt , white top , black jersey or sumthin like that , not such a strict uniform Danny from Plymouth I think we should keep school uniform .<-->O
Everyone looks quite smart and no-one is made to feel that they are not as well off as some others .<-->O
It helps to make everyone feel equal , therefore avoiding some chances for bullies to get stuck in .<-->O
Alex - Devon skool is there for kids to b disciplined and part of that involves wearing uniform if u guyz got ta a problem wit dat then mayb u shud opt for home tutorin ?!?!?! krissie tgc new zealand wotz up all my homies from tp , there no teacher ova my shoulder so i can speak da truth .<-->O
every one says you do n't get judged when wearing uniform but that aint true theres always someone hu pionts out that , that person has a second hand uniform or there skirt is short or they have a long skirt or there jersey is all holey and then we are always being told by our teachers , deans and our dp 's that were not wearing it properley .<-->O
theres also all theres rules that come wif wearing uniform like if u have pe last u have to get changed into your skool uniform before you leave the skool grounds , and i 'll rather be judge because of my own clotrhes than be judged because of my skool uniform .<-->O
and mr liddle rocks he gave me back my fone !!!!!! Jasmine from Guyana i think school uniforms should be abolished because everyone should have the freedoom our choice to wear what they want.BUT they should put strict rules in place that would allow children to dress suitably and not too vulgar .<-->O
chin Whitesboro high I dont have school uniforms but I 've been doing som reading on them and it sounds realy stupid Bernie - Japan Here in Japan , schoolkids wear uniforms right through high school , until they 're 18 years old .<-->O
There is no rivalry between schools simply because of uniforms -LRB- differences of -RRB- .<-->N
But , across the nation , most uniforms have a similar look to them .<-->N
There are days when kids can wear casual clothes to school , and at these times , the character of the kids seems to change .<-->N
That is , they suddenly become class-orientated and it 's an `` I 'm better than him/her because I 'm wearing ... '' kind of attitude .<-->O
I 'm all for abolishing the uniform but with solid rules in place .<-->N
Such as : girls can not wear make-up and excessive jewellry , and definitely no mini-skirts or provocative clothing .<-->O
-LRB- I fully understand the girls themselves , and indeed some boys , may not be promiscuous , but let 's not tempt fate -RRB- .<-->O
Boys should n't be allowed to wear designer track-suits , especially in an age where this symbolizes thuggery or being a gang-member .<-->N
Abolish it by all means , but put strict rules in place .<-->N
Perhaps even have certain days when a uniform should be worn , so that a sense of respect - to school and attitude ??? , - is firmly established ?<-->O
Stef NZ i belieave that uniforms are good and bad in manny different ways because you dont have to wear normal good clothes to school and be bullied on what you wear but it denies the individuality that every person needs to have , it would if the uniforms were that you could wear what u want but it wasent allowed to be untidy and ununappropriate laura from tgc school unforms r ok but we need more mufty days and nicer uniforms Alisia tga nz I think that uniforms are not a good idea because as young women we should be able to show our selfs as individuals .<-->O
Wearing uniforms does not let us express this .<-->N
We are a democratic society and as this we should be able to have our say .<-->O
I beleive that most of the school pupils that are forced to wear these uniforms most likely have perfectly good clothes decaying in their wardrobes .<-->O
And they may make our school look tidy and resectable .<-->N
But i reckon it makes us look like education slaves .<-->O
nicole bright tga i think uiniforms sux they are dumbest idea eva who wants to wear a uniform cause i dont.they are so ugly and cost heaps teachers sould have to suffer and wear them also.we should also be able to pack on make up Mary NZ i dont really care if uniforms are abolished or not cheers Samantha Tauranga girls college Hello my name is Samantha i am new at Tauranga Girls Collage i think that the uniform suks compared to Te Awamutu Collages we were allowed to wear trousers black ones and here we are allowed to wear only stuiped stocking and they are not as warm as pants anyway I think that they should ditch uniforms all together or have more mufftie days thanks 4 reading .<-->O
cherie from T.G.C I 'm 14 and i go to an all girls school .<-->N
We are forced to wear hideous uniforms and told constantly that we are not wearing our unifom correctly , i hate our unifom and i think if we have to wear uniforms so should the teachers.Our school has so many rules for students and i think its time to lay some rules down for the teachers .<-->O
Amanda NZ i think school uniforms sux !!!!!!!!!!!! They cost way to much and it takes 4ever to get dressed in the morning i only have one t-shirt and one skirt it sux it costs up to $ 300 hurdred dollars for a brand spanking new uniform that you wear for 3 years then change to a new skirt wich cost $ 30 - 40 dollars for a new one it sux !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also teachers are always telling us to keep our uniform stright .<-->O
WHAT HAPPENED TO BEENING YOUR OWN PERSON .<-->N
IT IS NOT NOMAL FOR US TO DRESS THE SAME .<-->N
klee from tauranga girls collage I rekon that school uniforms are really ` not cool ' because they are ugly and they cost alot of money .<-->O
I think that we should where mufty and pay $ 1.00 to where a uniform which i doubt anyone will do .<-->O
Zoey frm tga nz I dont think we shud have a uniform because they are sooooooooooooooooooooooo ugly !!!!!!!!!!! And they get worn every dae so thats just dirty .<-->O
And wen u finish school u look bak and say oh my god i wasted my money on that stupid uniform !<-->O
Sarah-Lee , Tauranga I think that uniforms are unexceptable .<-->N
Most are ugly and can be uncomfortable .<-->N
Wearing exactly the same thing as the rest of the school doesnt give people of our age to express how we feel or who we are as an individual through what we wear.They are expensive and most families dont have an extra $ 300 to fork out on hideous clothing only for school and which in a couple of years will never be worn again .<-->O
Why not wear the mufti clothes we have while we still fit them ?<-->N
saphire heather * Texas * i think they should not make students wear uniforms .<-->N

There is brige and pass they also wear uniforms but here at whs we dont wear them but i think they should only have them at privte schools .<-->N
Priory High School Exeter BAN UNIFORM as its a waste of money and humiliates people .<-->N
School uniform does not effect your education in any way what so ever Same with jewellery .<-->N

PLEASE help us are schools not listening to us thanks Nula Clifford , Kasmira Trapp , Alex Macan and Hanna Bowen tom adams from barlby in york i just love uniform its my life and soul !!!!!!!! Brittany , 14 from Tauranga New Zealand Tauranga Gi I think school uniforms should not be abolished because if people wear what they want it can lead to fights and arguments .<-->O
Everything turns into a fashion show , and instead of students paying attention to the school work they are looking at other people and either criticizing their choice of clothing or wishing they had it .<-->O
When I lived in USA we did not have to wear any uniform and I thought it was great !<-->O
But then when I came to NZ we all had to wear one and for a start I thought it was horrible , but now I agree with it .<-->O
Having a uniform you do n't have get up every morning wondering what you 're going to wear .<-->N
It 's easier on parents not having their kids breathing down their necks about keeping up with the fashion .<-->N
Yes , uniforms are very expensive but when you think about it in the long run , you would end up spending more on mufti , if you did n't have a uniform , than you would on a uniform .<-->O
So all in all I think uniforms are a good thing to have .<-->N
Hayleigh NZ I like we should wear uniforms but so should the teachers but we should have mufti once a week Big Burtha i think that we should wear abosolutly nothing because i like wear nonothing i prefer to be 1 with nature yea !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! nudity rocks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! katie taylor new zealand i think that school uniforms suk coz the jerseys r 2 heavy and they r makin my shoulders deformed lisa tauranga yea sure i agree that school uniforms can be ugly and uncomfortable but if we diddnt have to get up each morining and put our uniform on then we would spend lots of time in the morings trying to deside what it is that we were going to wear .<-->O
also there would be alot of pressure to follow the trends of clothing .<-->N
because we are all wearing the same thing people are not being judged the same as if we were wearing mufti k frm new zealand Our school has to wear uniforms and i actually mind .<-->N
everyone makes it out so bad but in a way they are actually a good thing !<-->O
i wld hate to have to wake up everyy morning and chose what i wear !<-->N
i mean it would be so expensive in the long run with all the trends and styles out there and we all no they have to be xtremly styly all in all i think u guys are jst big wimps and need hobbies lol Tarsha New Zealand i think uniforms are haydis and we should n't hav 2 wear dem if we dont want 2 but dey r sorta ok in da way dat dey r equelizers and u dont get judged 4 da clothes dat u wear but i still dont like dem and id rather wear mi own clothes 2 school if we could wear mufti id find it funny 2 c wot sum ppl would wear da day we hav p.e nz_girl School uniforms r kinda dumb coz u cant xpress urslf properly coz they ` res all these rules and regulations saying `` u cant wear this , u cant wear that '' and more often than not the uniforms are really ugly but if ur poor u cnt afford the `` latest fashions '' then i spose uniforms r gud .<-->O
Yazmin from NZ im 14 and i dont really care if we have 2 wear school uniforms or not .<-->N
Its good 2 wear them beacause nobody gets judged on what they wear but they r dumb aswell coz they r boring and cold and they make u look fat .<-->O
Sam from N.Z I am14 and I think that because we wear uniform we are all seen as equals and you do n't have to worry about getting ready in the morning .<-->O
April from New Zealand I think that school uniforms should be aboloshed because we ca n't express our individuality .<-->O
Sure we could have uniforms but they are to restricting and even though we are wearing the uniform we have to wear it a certain way and i think that is wrong and they are expecting to much of us .<-->O
We should be able to wear nail polish and jewellery .<-->N
I mean what harm is nail polish doing .<-->O
If were not allowed to wear these things then the teachers should n't be able to .<-->N
School uniforms should be abolished .<-->N
Big Burtha Im a 14 year old girl and I beleive that teenages have enough stress without the added pressure to look cool and worry about what other people think of your apperance although if you have a uniform you dont get to show ur inderviduality but it means less preasure and you dont have to worry about what you are going to wear and it becomes quite expensive in the long run because you will want to keep with the trends and be cool so yea school uniforms ROCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! harpreet new zealand uniforms are okay but sometimes they get really annoying and you just feel like wearing what you want .<-->O
Nicole NZ School uniforms are a waste of time .<-->N
People do n't get to be themselves and show individuality .<-->N

KaLeia from Tahiti When my school tried to enforce school uniforms we had a riot .<-->N
I do n't think uniforms are a good way to `` control the classroom '' because it did not work at my school .<-->N
Laura from Belfast Im 14 and I think yes uniforms are completely pointless but the govenors seem to think its a good idea to represent your school and look `` presentable '' .<-->O
But in sixth year you get to wear mufti so i suppose if they abolished it they would think it 's unfair .<-->O
The teachers ALWAYS complain about the length of our skirts and the state of our ties and blazers , but there 's a fad going round of putting paperclips and pins and badges on our sweaters and blazers to be `` individual '' .<-->N
We do n't get treated as clones , but I still dont like it -LRB- especially the colour , its mingin !<-->O
and expensive ! -RRB-<-->N
Josh Hazlett I think school uniforms are a bad idea because they ruin a person 's personality .<-->O
It also show 's that a kid can not have rights like ever other adult .<-->O
Ashley , Lake Villa , IL Hey , I really think that we do n't need uniforms .<-->O

School uniforms are terrible and I never want to have to where them !<-->O
Carol Metcalfe Essex I hated my daughter 's first day in reception when she went in like a little clone identical to all the others .<-->O
Thankfully she came home covered in very individualistic paint splodges .<-->N
As she and her friends do have very strong personalities the uniform has failed in its purpose to standardise the children .<-->O
It is useful in that we have plain drab clothing for school that I do n't mind getting dirty or stained .<-->O
It seems to me strange that we tell them as teenagers not to follow the herd , to say No to drugs , drink , underage sex etc , having expected them to be like all the others from age 3 by wearing green gingham and grey trousers .<-->O
Jodie , Oldham I HATE uniforms they are such a personality killer !<-->O

Laura , Ohio USA Above someone said that most USA schools wear uniforms , which is very untrue-only SOME Catholic schools do .<-->N
I for one am very glad that I do n't have to wear a uniform because it takes away a sense of individuality -- if you want to be school spirited then buy less formal shirts that show your spirit !<-->O
Cyrina from Bellevue , Ohio I think that school uniforms should be abolished because they take away from a person 's individuality .<-->O
I had to wear uniforms for 9 years while at a private school adn it was so hard to find the right kind of clothes that fit the dress code .<-->O
They did n't save my parents any money either .<-->N

L from York i think school unifrom should be banned because we have our own personality or i think we should be able to design our own uniform and vote for the best .<-->O
Hannah A from york I think school uniforms should be banned because everyone needs to express themselves , even though , some people say that people can be teased for what they are wearing people also say good coments about your clothes , not just bad ones .<-->O
Jessica I 'm 14 and i think that you should be able to where whatever u want .<-->O
it should be up to u to choose and the right should always be open to u. if we all wear uniforms we wont have the chance to express ourselves and show who we really are .<-->O
i definitly think we should take away the rule of having to wear uniforms stephenie milner I am 14 years old and I will have one next year at high school .<-->O
i think that school should be allowed in school .<-->N
school uniforms are cool !<-->N
Ray Carpenter from brigham city utah iam a sopomore in high school and uniforms are a way stupid idea why arent kids allowed tho express them selves how ever they want .<-->O
yeah so some of the out fits kids wear are pretty far out ther but for the most part every on else is pretty nomal Brittany from Winnipeg People have to waer them in the work place so why ca n't we have our freedom now Devon U.S / PA. .<-->O
School uniforms are embarraing , you get made fun of from other kids from other schools and you are unable to show your indivuality .<-->O
Jordann , Rochester Hills , MI I really do n't like the idea of school uniforms .<-->O
I have never had to wear one and I am glad .<-->N
Two very good friends of mine moved away and ended up going to private schools and every time I talk to them they , in one way or another , complain about the uniforms and how tacky they are .<-->O
Also , school uniforms take away our right to be ourselves and ware what we want .<-->O
james from usa it sucks Chris from Fresno , CA i think that school unforms should B abolished because by wearing school uniforms we are n't able 2 show and exspress ourselves tha way we want 2 .<-->O
eventhough u will have 2 wear uniforms when u get older and get a job i still think we should n't have 2 wear them .<-->O
Lauren New York It should be a law not to where uniforms ... we are or own people and should where whatever we feel like it no matter what people say about you .<-->O
Harriet Jones 14 , Farnborough England I personally like , and although do n't always enjoy , wearing a school uniform it really does make the early morning desicions much easier .<-->O
Think of in the summer when you have seen your friends everyday and they have all seen every one of your outfits , of course completly expressing your individual self !<-->N
I enjoy waiting to show my friends my new outfits and the excitement of a mufti day at school .<-->O
From somebody who used to hate the idea of being conformed into a uniform I can see the advantages .<-->O
And plus the old fashioned school boy caps and lovely private school dress codes are traditional and taking away the quaint british uniforms would be destroying our heritage and become just another state of america ... Sydney-from Frankton , IN Obviously everyone has a different opinion and some people decided to choose to express it poorly on this subject .<-->O
My opinion is that school uniforms create a since of conformaty but also a sence of belonging .<-->N
It is up to you and your school as to which is more important .<-->N
Declan , Dublin I think school uniforms are good as they help you to look smart .<-->O
most boys and girls in Ireland favour uniforms .<-->N
I am 15 and our class won the class prize for best uniform last year .<-->O
We are really trying to win it again this year , 2004 .<-->N
samatha california no on should have school uniform JUN School uniform should be abolished b/c when u slept late u can just wear pyjamas to school n that may save alot of time .<-->O
cynthia miami , fl i have been in schools with uniforms all my life and when i got to high school i felt so relief that i didnt have to wear uniform we still have a dress code but its better then tacky uniforms that dont match.the uniforms can damage your personality , becuase the way u dress is the way you act .<-->O
I think that they should be abolished Ursula , New York I disagree with most of you who say that school uniforms should be abolished .<-->O
I 'm also wondering how old you are .<-->N
Looking back at my experience , I went to Catholic schools from elementary school until high school where I had to wear uniforms , and at the beginning I hated it , but as the time passed I got used to it and was actually glad that I did n't have to find different clothes to wear every day .<-->O
And if you think about it when you get older and find a good job , wo n't you also have to wear a `` uniform '' -LRB- meaning your business suit or what ever job you 'll work at -RRB- And are n't you suppose to get to know a person for who he/she is and not for their clothes .<-->O
charlotte , newton abbot , devon I think we should be able to make our won school uniform up , maybe have 3 different varaties to choose from then we ca n't complain .<-->O
If we abolish the uniform then the poorer students may have the mick taking out of them Brittani Im 15 i think we should not have uniforms in school .<-->O
I think students should get to wear whta they want .<-->O
At my scool girls can wear skirt but boys ca n't wear shorts and then gils do n't get to wear compear pants .<-->N
that is why i think school uniforms should be abolished from schools .<-->N
samantha viper i think school uniforms suck kids dont want to dress like every one else they should be able to dressthe way they like and if they make fun of the other kids than so be it we dont have to wear school uniforms but i just want everyone to hear how i feel about em students should not be punished like that .<-->O
oliver it is so bad ~ !<-->N
olivia london i like the school uniform beause no one can call u names but some school uniform are to out to were in the sun uniforms are ok and not ok it matters about how it looks like Maria from Devon I think school children should wear what they like to school .<-->O
darren devon while i agree that uniform gives identity to a college or school , i also agree that casual-wear makes people more productive .<-->O
so long as it does not detract from their education , i see no reason why students can not wear what they like .<-->O
It allows people to express themselves , providing it is within reason -LRB- e.g. tattoos ; pierced noses etc -RRB- .<-->N
Freedom allows expression .<-->N
Expression breathes confidence .<-->N
Confidence gives results .<-->N
Demetria , bermuda i think uniforms should be abolished because they r boring and we like to wear your own clothes that we brougt .<-->O
WE SPENDT THE MONEY .<-->N
WE SHOULD N'T LET IT GO TO WASTE .<-->N

ZIY from MALAYSIA Altough many people especially teenagers think that school uniform should be abolished , I still think that school uniform should not be abolished because it can demonstrate the identity of the students .<-->O
School uniform can help students to concentrate on their work better as they do n't need to think about how they look like in their clothes or what clothes they should wear because they wear the same uniform.Besides that , the uniform instils students with discipline .<-->O
sanna from Finland i think school uniforms are great !<-->O
in Finland we haven t ever had school uniforms -LRB- as i know -RRB- .<-->O
Some people wrote that it s expensive to buy all those trend + design clothes ... excuse me . .<-->N
what trend + design ?!<-->N
in school you don t have to look like a filmstar ... just like you !<-->O
Or are we so different here in Finland ?<-->N
But uniforms creates somekind of connections between students .<-->N
i know English schools from their uniforms :-RRB- but i can say that you who have to wear one - you know it best !<-->O
Michelle I think that school uniforms should definetely be abolished .<-->N
Im 15 and I think that its time that us teenagers are given a bit of freedom in school .<-->N
CHRISSYBIL BOULIN PEMBROOK PINES , FLA i feel that all people should have the right to express who they are and what they believe in .<-->O
wearing uniform does not help you express who you are at all .<-->N
the usa says they do n't want kids who ca n't afford good cloths to feel bad but that 's just hiding the truth to people .<-->O
life is hard and full of unfairness but hiding it to kids is n't going to make things better .<-->O
besides even with wearing uniform if your overweight or do n't have nice accessories to match you will be judge so all in all wearing uniform does not solve that problem lorna from gravesend You should have school uniform if you go to a trip & get lost youd be identified easily .<-->O
You should n't have school uniform because it makes more washing for childs parents .<-->N
hollie wise - kent i THINK SCHOOL UNIFORM IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE IF U WENT ON A TRIP AND GOT LOST THEN SOMEONE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE U BACK TO YOUR SCHOOL Ricky & Ryan we think that you should be able to were your own clothes and just were a badge with the name of your school .<-->O
jordan tulip-gravesend i think we should n't have school uniform because it costs to much money for parents who have loads of kids !<-->O
and it takes to long to find all the right uniform in the morning after the weekend and it is absoloutly rediculous !!!<-->O
Deyna and Jordon mercer engaland school uniform is wrong because people like to wear there new disigner clothes and its to much for a parents to keep ironing and washing when she got for kids and the uniform is too expensive !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! naomi from kent i think we should n't have school uniform because some people get picked on because of the uniform .<-->O
alison howse - kent I think school uniform stinks , coz im in year 6 and our school uniform is rubbish .<-->O
And if we got to wear our own clothes it would be fab !<-->N
but our school head teacher wont even let us so its preety boring .<-->O
Ashley , Ohio i think we should have school uniforms because people would n't get laught at because they are wearing the same thing Marika I go to a Private school but the uniform is really expensive .<-->O
In the USA most of the schools wear uniform so why ca n't schools in England ?<-->O
Rhea , Devon School uniform may look bad but we all look bad together !<-->O
its easiest in the mornings and a cheaper option .<-->N
Uniforms should stay !<-->N
jess , london I do n't think that uniforms should necessarily be banned because they make all the students in school equal , and you do n't have to worry about not having enough money to spend on the latest designer clothes .<-->O
However , school uniforms could be made a bit trendier , so we do n't feel like wearing one 's such a chore .<-->O
Rik , Kent I think that school uniform should be compulsory up to eighteen .<-->O
Kids grow up too quickly these days and should be kept in their place !!!! chris uniforms are crap and they should be abolished Amanda hey ... no offense to ya 'll but i think that uniforms r good cuz then ppl dont make fun of u for the kind of clothes u can afford ... cuz ur all wearin the same thing !!!<-->O
Zoe and lucy from okehampton We are in year 11 at Okehampton College in Devon and although We do think that we should be able to be ourselves in school as well as out of school We think uniforms should be kept and not abolished as it would cost us and our parents so much money and some people who can not afford to wear their normal clothes will get bullied .<-->O
Thank you for hearing our say .<-->N
james scool uniforms suck so badley .<-->N
they make people look fat and ... . .<-->N
well lets not get to far into this .<-->N
also you get teased you your uniform is to short for you .<-->N
Sarah , USA We are told to be indiviuals but that would be kinda hard to do if we had to wear uniforms everyday .<-->N
I wo n't stop violence because its people who do the crimes not the clothing .<-->N
Uniforms would make you look like someone else and can cost a bundle .<-->O
Our parents pay for us to be educated through taxes , not to be told how to dress .<-->N
As long as people stay decent and really close to dress code , we should n't be made to wear some uniform that the school faculty members picked out .<-->O
My parents are for them ; they think that uniforms will help lower the crime rate and save us some money .<-->O
We may have to wear unforms to work in the future but we should be allowed to be young as long as we 're toddlers on up to 18 year olds .<-->N
christy , England i think that school uniform should not be abolish b ` cos it represents the school you go to and acts as an identity just like in other jobs such as police , nurse etc. wearing school should be a previledge but not be undermined .<-->O
it helps students from worrying about what to wear .<-->N
tyson moe kaitlyn we think that school uniforms are bad .<-->O
we dont like them .<-->N
taking out advice is good .<-->N
take it and dont jut read over it .<-->N
we know what we are talking about .<-->N
good stuff .<-->N
school uniforms dont allow kids to express themselves as an indivual !<-->N
what do you have to say about that ?<-->F
what now . .<-->F
see our advie is good !<-->N
TAKE IT AND DONT JUST READ OVER IT !!!!!! Aimee England -LRB- stockport -RRB- im in year 8 at stockport school and i think we should keep uniform because everybody will get bullied due to desighner clothes and not having the write clothes to where i mean you parents will have to by you laods more clothes and spend lots more money whats the point when you can just by a full uniform and p.e kit for under 50 Pedro , Anderson School uniforms are only for the lame .<-->O
Lily from Berkeley Ca I agree with Diego umiforms do suck !<-->N
You cant ' express yourself in them and everyone looks the same .<-->N
I would not want to go someplace where everyone looks like clones .<-->O
and it does n't express the real issues of equity/equality which are race and gender .<-->N
uniforms are a bunch of bull crap .<-->N
Moe & Tyson We think that school uniforms are pretty lame .<-->O
It doesnt show any way to express yourself to anyone .<-->N
Teachers can express themselves . .<-->F
why cant we ?<-->F
good question !!!<-->F
ha got you there !<-->N
Another thing is that you would have to spend alot of dough .<-->F
For 2 outifts . .<-->F
no way on earth !!!<-->F
only one type !!<-->F
Thats our theory !!<-->N
carly hardwidge , cullompton i think that school uniform should be abolished cuz its complete crap and most teachers wear whatever they like so why cant we .<-->O
also kids in devon have the coolest dress sense whitney frazier i believe that kids should be able to wear what they want just as long as it is appropiate to their attire or shool dress code.This is also revealed in the 1st ans 14th amendment of the constitution .<-->O
Diego indiana uniforms suck jan form london Uniforms help stop the divide form rich and poor being too obvious as everyone is dressed in the same way .<-->O
They also provide a feeling of cohesion and that you are part of a group which must help discipline Alex Escobar from Paramount I hate the uniform school .<-->O
I think not important .<-->N
All school not did the uniform school .<-->N
Al school must free dress every year .<-->N
For uniforms school ?<-->N
mrs. overwhelmed nancy i think that school uniforms are a bad idea because , they `` lead to ridicule and by abolishing uniforms it allows a sence of expression Sandra , Frankfurt Germany I think school uniforms are a good idea because you ca n't differentiate between the poor families and rich if kids are all wearing the same .<-->O
I do n't want to have to spend lots of money on the latest trend and designer wear so my kid can fit in at school .<-->O
bethany , naomi sa i hate school , and da uniforms .<-->N
Tiana - Toledo , Ohio I think school uniforms should be abolished because it lets us as students express ourselves .<-->N
Everyone does n't have the same style in clothing and some people rather dress differently to bring out `` the true person in them . ''<-->O
If we are all supposivly different , then why would anyone want us to act as if we are the same or are interested in the same type of clothing just for a few hours of the day ?<-->O
LilRay @ Frisco Cali School uniforms in a way is both good and bad .<-->N
The good part is : kids would n't have to worry about what they 'll be wearing or what brand is in style , students 's wo n't be judged by their peers because of what they wear , uniforms can prepare kids for the work force .<-->O
Most jobs requires you to wear uniforms anyway -LRB- police , doctors , sports player , cheerleaders , soldiers , firemens , lawyers ... -RRB- , so why complain .<-->O
On the other hand , uniforms can be bad because it limits you from be an individual person , you wo n't be able to express yourself , and takes away your freedom .<-->O
Schools already have dress codes so , no i do n't think schools should force students to wear uniforms if they do n't want to .<-->O
Felicity Schools from Blackpool I think uniform should be abolished because I find it really uncomfortable to have to wear one !<-->O
and at our school we have to wear our top button fastened on our shirt and if the teacher finds me with it undone I get nackered !!!<-->N
Jeremy , Melbourne Australia As a year 12 student this year , therefore my last year of school ever , i think it is imperative to have a school uniform .<-->O
I have worn a school uniform almost every school day of my life , and i know it saves having to think about what to wear in the morning .<-->O
The occasional `` casual days '' that we have , make it hard enough for me to decide what the hell im going to wear .<-->O
i can not imagine what i would do if i had to make that decision everyday .<-->N
I am friends with people who dont have to wear a uniform , and i feel kind of sorry for them .<-->O
I enjoy the privelege of having a uniform , which is rare in many other places around the world .<-->O
However , at my school , uniform is taken to an extreme .<-->O
Having an untucked shirt , is like asking the teachers for a 45 minute detention .<-->N
If my tie is n't done up to the top , there 's another detention .<-->N
Probably to your surprise , i go to a public school where i dont even have to pay school fees , and yet uniform is so strict .<-->O
None-the-less , i do enjoy having my uniform .<-->N
It makes me proud to be at my school .<-->N
So lets keep scool uniforms .<-->N
Peace out .<-->N
Booyakasha Shay from Indiaanpolis , In Well , I believe that everyone is entitle to their own opinion .<-->O
So , I believe that everyone should be able to express themselves in their own special way .<-->O
Because when you get older nine times out of ten you want go into a work place that has a dress code that you do n't like or agree with .<-->O
That 's just my own opinion Bethany from Stuarts Draft , VA School uniforms take away from the creativity , individuality , expression , and imagination that students express through what they wear .<-->O
I thought that school was supposed to be about education .<-->N
Now it seems that all it is about is getting money and fashion .<-->N
This is not a fashion show , so stop trying to act like it is .<-->O
Public schools get money from the tax payers .<-->N
If the tax payers want the money for education , stop putting it more towards the fashion of boringness .<-->N
School is supposed to be a place that the students actually enjoy coming .<-->O
If uniforms are inforced , then I can guarentee that absences will increase by at least 25 % .<-->N
Uniforms are for the REAL workforce .<-->N
This is just school .<-->N
People need to learn to differentiate between the two .<-->O
Devon Maddox from crossroads I think that school uniforms are bad for schools because some people will not dress like other people .<-->O
Kelsey California I am moving to BAth , England this summer from berkeley , a very unique and liberal area and i remeber times going to england seeing almost everyone wearing uniforms .<-->O
i could never begin to think of wearing one , although they may have positives in referring to peer pressure and price of clothing , the general outcome sucks .<-->O
I myself am not one to constantly worry about staying with the `` trend '' and it seems that a major reason for uniforms is to resist bullying and pressure , so all i have to say is stop worrying , dude i mean who gives a crap , your you , wear what ever the hell you want , people shouldnt get so hyped in staying with the trend and crap .<-->O
clothing allows me to express my individuality in another way and i would never want to have that taken from me , apart of me stands out with my clothing , allows me to protest my likes and dislikes , show people a bit of who i am , and i like that .<-->O
Travis school uniforms r pointless because they suck Anon .<-->N
Windsor Generally , i reckon that uniform is a good idea , i cuts out bullying especially from the rich kids in all their labels and then there is the others who get picked on for having HI-TEC , But , if the schools want us to wear it they have to at least make it look half decent , take ours , GREEN jumper , green ties , whats that all about .<-->O
and whatever happened to individualty ?<-->N
stipped us of that havent they .<-->N
even if u try to make it different the teachers will only say NO .<-->O
Becky im from the USA Well , I think that school uniforms are a really bad idea because all your teachers in school say that its ok to be different but you cant be different when you all look the same .<-->O
and normal clothes and the way you dress without uniforms show your personality .<-->O
and when you have uniforms it doesnt show your personality .<-->N
they will also keep from making friends because when your out somewhere after school and didnt get a chance to change then people will be laughing at you because you have to wear uniforms .<-->O
when you first meet someone they cant guess on how your personality is because your not wearing what you want !!!!! so i think that school uniforms are a really bad idea , but thats just my opinon .<-->O
Zach the opinionated American -LRB- 15 -RRB- In my opinion , school uniforms actually hinder you from making friends .<-->O
When I go to school I look at peoples ' clothes to see if I have common interests with them .<-->N
That 's how I made my friends .<-->N
When I came to my current school , I had a hard time understanding other peoples ' personaities because the uniforms did not show their personalities .<-->O
caitlin White Pigeon hs/ms White Pigeon Mi I think we should be able to choose what we wear b/cuz they want us to be focussed on our work , And how are we supposed to be focussed on our work if we are worried about what we wear .<-->O
and they tell us to be different not do drugs and stuff like that well we would n't be different if we all looked the same .<-->O
That is just what i think and i 'm sure that there are some good reasons why we should have to wear them but i think we should n't have to .<-->O
anthony pinnock school uniforms are crap there worser than anything i think we should n't have i mean if america do n't have it why should we ?<-->O
Elysia from Barrow I think some school uniform is a good thing because if you go on a trip and get lost and someone spots you they will know were your from and take you back there .<-->O
but i feel sorry for some children because they have to wear horrible uniform .<-->O
natalie 16 from combe martin school uniforms are a god thing .<-->N
im quite lucky , my uniform is pretty good .<-->O
its a polo shirt with a blue sweater .<-->N
school uniforms are designed to make everyone equal .<-->N
wouldnt you feel upset if your rich mates had all these great clothes and you stood there looking like a tramp ?<-->O
lol Dshizznic scool uniforms should burn in the underworld .<-->N
I would say other things but the teachers watching me !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amy luton I hate school Uniform it is ugley I have to wear a green tie GREEN im mean who picked out this dress code it is well ugley all the other kid , s in my school think it is ugley to give me your votes for my school Brian JEROME ID School Uniforms are not the answer because it does n't change your behavyor or your personality eathier unaimuse person I really ca n't say but I do say this .<-->O
Kids should n't be forced to where somthing they do n't like !<-->N
Jessi from Springfield I think that school uniforms are a good idea .<-->O
I think that the dress code at my school is too strict , and it would be a lot easier to just not worry about if our clothes fit the dress code because we would be wearing what the school gave us that we have to wear , so our clothes WOULD fit the dress code .<-->O
Michelle B. Ravenna Michigan I would never wear a school uniform because , most of the uniforms are UGLY and i like to have my own style my style brings out my personality .<-->O
We as students need to express ourselves .<-->N
Some people dont have enough money to pay for uniforms .<-->N
Besides who wants to look like everbody else everybody is different .<-->O
I wouldnt want to look like a billion other people , Would you ?<-->O
moe from japan i hate those uniforms i would never ever wear one .<-->N
i would like to have my on style !!<-->N
kirsty i can see why kids say they h8 uniforms but it looks smart and stops kids worryin bout avin brand names and new clothes to wear each week !<-->N
its only at skool and its gud practice 4 a job !<-->N
besides u wouldnt get mufti days then Danielle Philadelphia I think school uniforms suck and we look better and ourselves without them Peter school uniforms are a good thing : they are a symbol of standards -LRB- high not low -RRB- , they distinguish between work time and play time -LRB- somthing that adolescents find hard to do -RRB- .<-->O
The represent your school -LRB- somthing to take pride in -RRB- and guess what when you go to work you will also have to wear a uniform just like these people ; doctors , soliders , pilots , police , firemen , lawyers , company staff stop whinning , and start taking pride in whatever school you represent !<-->O
marjon , holland schooluniforms are sucks !!!! Lisa - Canada I used to live in England -LRB- about a year ago i moved to Canada -RRB- .<-->N
I used to wear a uniform and i hated it , but than i moved here and it is such stress to get up every morning and have to decide what you are going to wear .<-->O
When you wear whatever you want , you certainly can express yourself a lot more , but it also means that you have to spend more money on clothes and kids that ca n't really afford different clothes every day feel left out .<-->O
lu canada uniforms the word makes me shiver in fear the only thing we have the choice of wearing in our backpakcs how lame is that tho uniforms are eualizers they are to much of one charlie , 15 I have a strong view that school uniforms should be kept as they establish an infranstructure within the school .<-->O
a uniform also affects the way people think and their concentration .<-->N
A uniform is like a football strip .<-->N
It creates a sense of unity within the school .<-->N
If uniforms were abolishied , then this relationship would be tarnished peter from Tavistock Well , I think you young people should all be grateful for being obliged to wear uniforms .<-->O
Left to yourselves , you have a brilliant knack of looking dreadful .<-->O
You stick pieces of metal through your flesh , and have absolutely no sense of style in clothes .<-->N
Wurzel Gummidge himself would laugh at you !<-->N
UnshakeableTeen i think that school uniforms should be abolished .<-->N
it limits our creativity and individuality .<-->N
i believe that by having school uniforms we are causing people to have no sense of themselves .<-->N
they 'll grow up and be used to having decsions made for them and not know what exactly to do .<-->O
if the only reasons they have for keeping uniforms is because they want to stop bullying and stop gangs they are sorely mistaken .<-->O
we will never be able to stop bullying if they dont bully about clothing they 'll find something else trust me .<-->O
the gangs arent stopped either even though they cant express themselves through clothing they will express themselves through something else .<-->O
Gary Vine , Torquay The army will next be turning up to work in Jeans and t-shirts .<-->N
Uniform is a part of everyday life whether at school and should be kept in place for that purpose .<-->N
Aaron , St.Budeaux , Plymouth I think that we shouldent halv to wear school uniforms as we have to wear them and we are not confie , this means that we can not contrait on work .<-->N
I understand that people might not have the ` in ' close but the minoritay is against them .<-->O
Aaron From Tamarside C.C Linda , Florida I think school uniforms should be abolished because their stupid and there 's no point .<-->O
Adults say there goin to stop bullying and fights but most likely they 'll start more .<-->N
okay so they may stop gangs in school but then the students will just recruit more people and show their `` gangs '' outside of school .<-->O
They 'll also figure out some way that they can do it inside the school .<-->N
Also , we 'll all look alike and we 'll feel like we 're in the military or soemthing .<-->O
Or a private or parochial school .<-->N
Which sucks by the way !<-->N
Yeah so that is my opinion on school uniforms !<-->N
shoulderbananas ScHoOl UnIfOrM Is RuBbIsH !<-->N

evan hernadez i am a pro skater and i get home school gut i think studens should be able to wher thier regular cloths so they can exprss them self to evryone .<-->O
i also thnk unifors suck Paul Rodrigez I Really think that unifroms suck and i really think that students should be able to express them selves i recomend every one just stays naked and there wouldnt be any discrimination with people and there brand name colths PS .<-->O
Keep on Sk8ing sara2 i think in uniforms you can sitll express yourself through jewelry and how you wear your uniform .<-->N
Be creative ... dye your hair or wear it differently ... there are always ways to get around these things .<-->N
Ariel , from canada school uniforms do suck .<-->N
they eliminate the freedom for physicle expression.Grown ups have already taken most of our individuality away , just let us dress the way we want !!!<-->O
Deanna - Ontario Canada scool uniforms are good .<-->N
not only to stop the ridicule of those who would usually judge people by their clothing , it would also stop them from saying things like `` you picked a crappy outfit '' .<-->O
plus , there are some girls who like to wear skirts and such , but do n't have ones that are n't like church attire , uniforms would give these females like myself a chance to wear dressier clothing that is n't too dressy .<-->O
Casper from SD California i can see how schools would want uniforms , it makes the children all feel the same , and not have to worry about the latest trends .<-->O
But my opinion is dressing in our normal clothes makes us individuals , to stand out , as long as our dressing does n't show parts of our un seen but cracks than why the heck not ?<-->O
I believe the schools should just put some boundary lines on the dress code , not so much that every student must wear the same thing , just so many people can feel like themself when they step out of their house or onto a school bus .<-->O

Glitch hi there i think the Truff Dress codes ARE GAY !!!!!!!! Darren Canada Uniforms suck Dan Stoner from Brighton , UK School uniform leaves no room for people to expand their individuality and become adults by being able to choose what you wear and especially when appropriate , abolish all school uniform and let people be who they wan na be !<-->O
maurice from south queensferry I already have placed on record in a submission to a Scottish parliament equal opportuntiies enquiry , in 2001 , that all uniforms or dress control are against international law on minority rights .<-->N
this follows from the link , now scientifically understood , between skin sensitivity and active metabolism , that features in Tourette and Asperger syndromes and attention deficit disorder .<-->O
As an adult I wear modest sensible shorts all year round , and while I 'm no supporter of shorts uniforms , they are obviously cruelty to the majority who experience them , how ironic and stupid that I in the minority who would have liked it never had it .<-->O
I was a victim of longs uniforms throughout school , 1973-85 era , and the discriminatory misery of schools encouraging bare legs for girls while forbidding them for boys , which is still the case today .<-->O

nida usa school uniforms have pro 's and con 's i do n't know exactly what i would perfer .<-->O

Nick from Kent I think that school uniform is probably a bad idea .<-->O
It is almost definetely hard to play in it at play.but kids could get teased if they do not have the right stuff .<-->O
It would be better to wear trainers at play times .<-->O
At our school we get lunch time detention if we wear trainers to school .<-->N
Also if we wear a cap to school .<-->F
Own clothes can be more comfortable .<-->N
I think we should be able to wear what we want to and what we think looks smart .<-->O
Some school uniforms can cost a lot which is expensive for parents when children change school .<-->N
Diana H , Bromley , Kent I think that uniforms are a good idea for a number of reasons : - 1 .<-->O
All children are wearing the same so it removes the competitiveness between designer labels , trainers etc. 2 .<-->N
Children look smart 3 .<-->N
It helps identify children who are not in school when they should be !<-->N
If trouble errupts at bus stops etc after school it is easier to identify where the children are from so the school can be made aware if necessary Moggy I really think school uniform should be abolished , and pupils should decide if they want to to Fitness in school , becauser its making children do things they do n't want to change viv from washington I think that a school uniforms shoul bern .<-->O

Uniforms do NOT prevent bullying nor harrassment .<-->N
Uniform-enforcement IS bullying and harrassment , about personal appearance .<-->N
Uniforms institionalise these evils and makes them systematic policy .<-->N
The form of uniform -LRB- Collar/jacket/tie etc -RRB- expressses and replicates outmoded `` white-collar , middle-class '' prejudice .<-->O
We teach children , through uniforms , HOW to be appearance - prejudiced .<-->N
Then we ask them not to mind the colour of different people !!<-->N
All the inconsistencies about uniforms disappear if you realise they are just middle-class white-collar prejudice .<-->O
So NO clothes with manual work origins -LRB- Denim -RRB- and you must be in uncomfortable , old-fashioned `` Sunday-best '' so that you look as if you 're to clever to be asked to do any real work .<-->O
These attitudes belong to the 1920 's .<-->N
`` study & play '' are the activities at school and they are best done in comfortable clothes .<-->N
-LRB- eg jeans & sweat-top -RRB- This school-identity argument for uniforms is in the lead at the moment ; but not because students crave an institutional identity .<-->N
The creeping privatisation of schools means the school needs an identity to brand itself .<-->N
Marketing to parental choice means emphasis on image , brand-identity and packaging .<-->F
i.e.Form over substance .<-->N
Far from despising the designer-label -LRB- mentality -RRB- , schools rejoice in it , and model it .<-->O
Each school wants to market itself as the local designer - label school , and each child is forced to become a hoarding , and a label-bearer , in this campaign !<-->N
To replace a Nike label with a St.Toff s label reinforces the label-mindset , instead of challenging it as education ought .<-->N
The top-labels are private schools with their more old-fashioned uniform image .<-->N
This is what drives the current reversion to caps and blazers ; it offers the private-school-cachet , at your local comprehensive , now !<-->N
And if this isn t stopped we could all end up with 19th Etonian outfits !<-->N
School have to claim to `` cherish diversity '' but they only teach grudging acceptance of imposed natural differances .<-->O
-LRB- Colour , gender etc -RRB- `` Because they ca n't help it '' .<-->N
But no CHOICE of one 's own personal appearance will be respected nor tolerated .<-->N
This is a spirit that detests diversity .<-->N
In fact uniforms are loved by all dictators because they express and facilitate the transformation of individuals into a mass that obeys .<-->N
It is an evil an Draconian situation that compulsory state education means daily control of one 's personal appearance choices by agents of the state .<-->O
It would shock us except that we are so conditioned to it .<-->O
Successful Education systems run without it , therefor it CAN NOT be necessary , therefore these horrendous restrictions are unjustifiable My name is Christy and I am form North America I 'm 12 and I said that students should wear uniform in school.Because in my fact , I have saw many kids calling their parents to bought expensive cloths and if parents do n't , they are going to cried and do everythings that can make their parents to buy expensive clothes .<-->O
Students should wear uniforms in school , because that could make them look more orderly and `` cleaner '' , thy do n't need to spend a lot of time on their dressing and save time , same money and learned how to make godd choice in our life.So this is what i want to say about the School Uniform and I would be happy that if on the voting Results i can see that the `` Yes '' can bit the `` No '' .<-->O
2004.2.22 BAM , Surrey I 've been at both types of schools , uniforms and no uniforms .<-->N
It is my opinion that uniforms take away from an individuals personality .<-->O
They are uncomfortable and expensive .<-->N

ALEX BENDER addison trail The reason I think that school we shouldn t have uniforms is because they are uncomfortable and very expensive .<-->O
And the reason I know this for a fact is because I came from a school with uniforms and most of the kids there hated them .<-->O
The main thing that bothered all of us is that the uniforms are very uncomfortable .<-->N
Another reason not to have uniforms would be a waste because most of the kids would not apply to the dress code .<-->O
The worst thing is the happiness level of the school would be even lower and I would guarantee the raise in dropouts .<-->O
josh school uniform is so rubbish !!!!!!!! Megan from Bay City I think that uniforms are stupid because you do n't get to wear what you want and you do n't get to express yourself .<-->O

Daniel From NZ Uniform sucks !<-->N
Lindsey P - Solon I think that school uniforms in a way are good and bad .<-->O
They are bad because it does not allow students to show their personality/individuality , and students should not be forced to wear something that they do not want to because it says in the law that every person has equal rights , and should be able to do what they want , if it is not illegal , and wearing what you want to wear is not illegal .<-->O
School uniforms are good because if everybody wears the same uniform to school everyday , people could not make fun of other people 's clothing , because they are being forced to wear the same thing .<-->O
Also , it would make the classroom a safer place , and would have kids do better in school because they are not worried about the latest fashions , and how they look .<-->O
Kids would end up being more focused on their studies if there were school uniforms .<-->N
I have mixed feelings about them .<-->N
Amy i dont like uniform Katie , from Atherton , Australia school uniforms are cool !!!<-->N

Most girls at my skewl get detention for bad uniforms !<-->N
Girls complain soooooo much and they arent so cheap !<-->O
Also the ways girls find individuality with them is by adding their own sexuality which is annoying and reallyu boys find uniforms more appealing than regular cloths !<-->O
Down with uniforms !<-->N
Peter Turner School uniforms increase standards and improve behaviour.A school uniform also acts as a distinguishment between work time and play time .<-->N
Pupils need to learn the difference between when to mess around and when to work .<-->O
h e roo I dont think we should have school uniforms as they restrict our individuality.We should all be recognised for who we are and that means not wearing uniform .<-->O
tal , dallas tx I think school uniform are so so so bad if u have a unifrom you cant wear what u want and plus say you want to wear a pair of pant u cant because u have to wear a uniform or a skirt you cant it gives u more freedom Andrea School Uniforms should only be used in big school , where they can be most effective .<-->O

The school blazer is mismatched with the Cheong Sam and doesn t keep us warm .<-->N
They are badly designed and cheaply produced for a captive market .<-->N

If school uniforms are not adopted , we will be free to choose clothes to wear depending on the factors like the habitus of different people , weather and our everyday-different mood , etc. .<-->O
Moreover , the phobia of schooling in some students will be scribed off if school uniforms are not adopted .<-->O
School will no longer be a formal and terrifying place .<-->O
It creates a harmonious environment to study .<-->N
Students may have lessons freely and enjoy them more .<-->N
Lessons will be more appealing and students will be more concentrated on them .<-->O
For instance , they may have more courage to speak up during lessons and find learning is fun .<-->O
Both the atmosphere of learning and the effect of teaching will be better .<-->O
Resources of schools and hence the government will be saved then .<-->N
Without school uniforms , division between teachers and students will not be so obvious .<-->O
They may make friends to each other , and the students will be more willing to share their feelings with their teachers and let the teachers understand them more .<-->O
Relationship between them will be improved .<-->N
Students will love their school lives , which is just like staying in a big family .<-->O
Teachers are like their parents , schoolmates are like their brothers and sisters .<-->O

nerd from kansas We do n't have to wear school uniforms at my school but i beleive we should .<-->N
School uniforms would end the discrimination against people who do n't have the finacial ability to buy name brand cloths .<-->O
Uniforms that are picked by the students for comfort and approved by the school board would be a great way to create school unity .<-->O
Many of the cloths students wear -LRB- especially girls -RRB- are reavealing and morally degrading .<-->O
Required school uniforms would end this thoughtless degradation of our young ladies by popular culture .<-->O
School uniforms that are approved by both school boards and students are a solution to many of the problems in today 's public schools .<-->N

i jimberly , KEVICC we got rid of the uniform or ` dress code ' as they liked to call it because no one stuck to it and all the teachers spent the whole lesson telling people to tuck their shirts in or change out of their trainers into their school shoes and no work got done and every one got annoyed , the no unifrom thing was to concentrate on the learning and it works.now there is no arguments about who should be wearing what and every1 works harder.its a bit of a hassle some mornings deciding what to wear but i wud n't go back to uniform .<-->O
there is n't any bullying about what people are wearing there are divides between kids obviously but every school has that .<-->N

They are far too expensive just for school.I do n't know about other schools but the ones around this area have absolutely minging uniforms !<-->O
I would like to beable to wear what I want to school but if we totally lost them then pehaps others would be teased for not wearing things that are the fashion but if they made them beter looking and alot more comfy then more folk would wear them !<-->O
But still agree they should be abolished Jennifer - Geneva When I first came to Switzerland many years ago I thought the school children looked so scruffy without uniforms and when my son started school I realized how expensive all those `` scruffy '' designer clothes were !<-->O

I have to say that informs are stupid , but there is so many things that A LOT of students do n't like .<-->O
For one , you can not show who you really are when you were a uniform .<-->O
If you had to go out in public after school , you are going to really stand out and no one likes that .<-->N
I do n't care what you teachers and parents think of what I as high school student is standing up for thoes who do n't like uniforms at all !<-->O
Infact they say that you do n't have to pay as much for uniforms then for regular cloths , but that is NOT true .<-->N
You are really spending more for the uniforms , and the prices for them have really gone sky high .<-->O
Students that were the uniforms have more of a chance at being beat up then if your not wereing a uniform .<-->N
School uniforms are UNCOOL !<-->F
DOWN WITH SCHOOL UNIFORMS !!!<-->N
Jenn , Ontario Canada Uniforms are so much easier , you do n't have to think about what your wearing and what you 'll look like coz everyone is gon na look the same.You get to waer your own shoes , bag , jacket however you want you hair and makeup -LRB- in most schools -RRB- I know I 'd rather have uniforms coming from England where I wore a uniform for the eleven yrs I was in school there to Canada with no uniform it was different.I 'm not saying it 's not nice to wear your own clothes , coz it is nice to be able to wear pj 's to school or shorts n t.shirts in the summmer .<-->O
Uniforms do work tho and they are alot cheaper coz I know from my own experiences that people do get bullied coz they do n't have a Tommy Hilfiger sweater or the latest football shirt.Uniforms are a good thing they do n't discrimnate and hey its not a life sentence most schools give you more freedom in sixth form and its only for 12 or 14 yrs .<-->O
Take pride in your uniform and school coz one day it 'll be gone and your look back and wonder what all of the fuss was about and wish you had n't got rid of those uniforms !<-->O
:-RRB- david from loughton I find school uniform very uncomfortable to wear especially if you have to wear ties .<-->O

cuz i wont have to worry about wut im ganna wear to school and i can sleep longer in the morning . .<-->N
i wish my school and all other schools would make students wear uniforms . .<-->N
and since students like to show off their new clothes then maybe they should pick one day out of the week where u get to wear wuteva u want . .<-->O
this way its fair for everyone . .<-->N
Lily from VA I think that it 's hard for kids that have never had to wear uniforms to just swich and be ok with it .<-->O

John F. Miller from Germany No state schools have Uniforms here in Germany.I go to a small private school in the black forest and I wish I had a unifrom .<-->N
British Kids do not realiese how lucky they are .<-->N
There is a lot of about who looks `` in '' and who looks `` out '' with a unifrom all this seperation would stop .<-->N
You can still be `` cool '' after school if you want , we on the other hand have to pretend to be at least semi cool to stop us beeing bullied .<-->O
Bring back school uniforms to german schools , keep uniforms at british school .<-->N
my name is yesinia diaz and am from south bend I think uniforms are stupied and we should not have to waer them Valerie Woodbridge , VA I think That school uniforms are dumb , school is the time we have to express ourselves and if we have uniforms we wont be able to be who we want to be ... or do waht we want to !<-->O
Katie , USA Coming from a high school with no uniforms-I am actually in favor of uniforms .<-->O
With the likes of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera as `` role models '' in our country , many young girls are wearing pants that do n't cover up their `` crack . ''<-->N
If we had uniforms , this unpleasant sight would not exits .<-->N
puggirl-maine I am homeschooled , so I do n't have to wear a uniform !<-->N
I could do my school work in my P.J 's if I wanted to .<-->N
But If I did go to school , I would not mind having a school uniform.Because then I would n't have to take for ever trying to find a cool outfit.And If there was a uniform rule , then It woulde n't take up half of my morning geting ready for school .<-->O
Then again I would hate to wear a school uniform.I woulde n't get to show off my own style , and what I like to wear out in publice !!!<-->O

Alex , Potters Bar I think we should get rid of school uniform because we buy other clothes anyway and school uniform makes us pay for other clothes we would n't otherwise buy .<-->O
I like my school but I would like it more if we could wear our own clothes .<-->O
Kate/Russia I have been to uniform and no uniform school and uniform is better .<-->O
In no uniform school kids compete to wear brand names -LRB- Nike , Tommy etc etc -RRB- which is expensive in my country .<-->N
Do n't give these people your money !<-->N
Also in no uniform school girls can wear trousers .<-->N
This is bad for the moral values .<-->O
Bernice Yes , I think schools should have school uniforms because it is a better way to learn .<-->O
Some believes that wearing uniform decreases amount of bullying .<-->N

Darren from Tavistock Hey Rebecca , have you missunderstood Wendys post ?<-->N
I thought she was having a go at people who think uniforms are for geeks .<-->N
-LRB- She says : `` And if you need to display your individuality through your clothes , you ca n't be much of an individual '' , which seems to favour uniforms . -RRB-<-->O
Well , thats how I read it , have i missunderstood ?<-->N
therese & emma co.down school uniforms do nofing 4 our figures therse magee i lv uniforms and i lv school im just sooooooooo glad 2 be bac after the hols Rebecca from north somerset TO WENDY * VERY FORCED SMILE AS I STRUGGLE TO BE POLITE * Have you ever wondered what it feels like to be considered a `` total geek '' ?<-->O
We ca n't all be perfect .<-->N
I am considered by most people in my school to be a freak mostly because i care about my grades , i do well in school , and i 'm not a size ten .<-->O
the only thing that keeps me vaguely anonymous is the fact that i where the same clothes as everyone else .<-->N
i can not afford the sort of clothes that would make me cool the eyes of people like you , or the body to go in them .<-->O
i have no doubt that the comments , sideways looks and snide remarks my friends and i have to endure would be a million times worse if i wore my own clothes to school .<-->O
i also do not see why i should have to be forced to worry that the things i like will not match up the standards of someone who obviously considers themselves above the rest of us .<-->O
Think VERY hard about your own opinions before you mock others .<-->O
No-one has any problem with you saying that you would like to see uniforms abolished , i agree that uniforms are often uncomfortable , but you have no right whatsoever to call the views of anyone else stupid .<-->O
just bcause you hold a particular view , that does not make unquestionably RIGHT .<-->O
Maybe you only call people geeks because you can not be bothered to find out anything more about them .<-->N
Daddy 's Girl Well , i was in uniforms 4 2 years .<-->N
But , my brother and sister wear it now and they hate it .<-->N
Some little children be having big t-shirts .<-->N
It was n't that bad until if you did n't wear yours you 'd have to put on one that the school provides .<-->N
jo from a little place in the country near tavisto i do n't fink skool uniform should be stopped , it means a bigger bill for clotthing for both kidz and parents and it also makes the skool look too scruffy .<-->O
i hav to wear a blazer + shirt + tie , so i think skool uniform should be less tight and more comfortable Stephanie from Van , TX I was in school uniforms for 5 years before i went to public school ... and before i knew how great it was to be able to express myself through my clothes i just thought they were something else my mom had to pay money for .<-->O
In the Bill of Rights it says that we are allowed to express our opinion and well frankly uniforms take that away from you .<-->O
Sailor shirts , plaid skirts , knee high socks , and closed toed shoes isnt exactly what i would say is being free .<-->O
Ben , Uk Keep the school uniform .<-->N
Its a part of school life , and socity .<-->N
Maby a good compramise would be to let the pupils personalise there uniforms , allowing make up , patches on blasers , shirts to be hung out per haps trainers in stead of shoes .<-->N
I dont see a problem as long as its non Offencive .<-->N
But keeping the basics the same !<-->N
Just an Idea Wendy , BC I love some of your comments , they 're so-let me think-stupid .<-->N
- uniforms are for geeks and dorks - you end up wearing the same clothes as a total geek !!<-->N
- etc. .<-->N
And if you need to display your individuality through your clothes , you ca n't be much of an individual .<-->O
Dingo New England I think that school uniforms should not have to be worn because children should be able to live their life and wear their own clothes because when they are adults they will have to wear uniforms , tuxes , dresses , and dressup clothes .<-->O
So , they should be able to wear their own style of clothes while they can .<-->N
D'Angelo Andrews Lanham MD UNIFORMS ARE THE DUMBEST THING I HAVE HEARD OF IN MY LIFE Paola New York I personally think that uniforms should not be abolished .<-->N
First of all , uniforms make people in a sense equal , which means there would not be bullying .<-->N

When the last day of school comes in our school we get to wear anything what we want but when everyone does that the school looks like a complete mess .<-->O

JAY 14 FROM EASTLEIGH I think school uniform is just one of the governments plan to make teenagers feel depressed.If u think about it , when u wear ur own clothes , u act differantly .<-->O
Plus , uniforms are for geeks and dorks Danielle & Helen , Uk School uniform should be banned because we agree with Tony it is restricting and you end up wearing the same clothes as a total geek !!<-->O
Uniform is a waste of money and it does n't let you show your individualality also teachers moan at you even if you have got uniform on !!<-->O
We think the law should be changed and teachers should let us wear what we want to and not what the whole school -LRB- including geeks -RRB- wear kirsty , uk I do n't like school uniform but some people would get bullied for what there wearing because they might not have alot of money.They wont get bullied if everyones wearing the same so it 's proberly best if we do have school uniform .<-->O
Sex god I dont care wot i wear coz i look good in n e thing even a thong that ur mum wears Jess from Eastleigh Im 14 and i found that school uniform should and should n't be allowed.I think it should because you do n't have to feel ashamed of what you wear and i do n't because its annoying .<-->O

peter wilkes from exeter It 's amusing to see young people complaining about school uniform , and then dressing all the same in their baseball cap , hoodie , joggers ' trousers , and trainers !<-->O
A kind of uniform for the uniform haters !!<-->O
Heather Mi I think that it doesnt matter what we wear even tho it would be alot easier to have them because then we wouldnt have to spend so much time looking for what we are going to wear the next day .<-->O
Well I dont know about all of you who read this but for most of the people at my school they do care what people think and care what they look like !<-->O
I think it is a good idea but then what about the people who cant wear short skirts -LRB- their skirts have to be down to their knees -RRB- or other people who have to dress a way becasue of their religon .<-->O
idk but i just wanted to say what i think like all of the other people have too !<-->O
nicole and zoe portaferry we hate wearing a uniform ... u shud be aloud to wear your own clothes then people wont treat you like the rest of the crowd at school cuz u look diffrent ... but in a uniform every one looks the same Beth from Central I dont like the skirt ... tooooo dammm long Chelsea York , Pa I think school uniforms are not good because it covers up peoples independence of who they are , but on the other hand kids dont get picked on for what they have on .<-->O
caitriona Ireland i think u should n't have to wear ur school uniform cause everyone looks the same Jose from Manchester , PA It doesnt really matter kids .<-->O
Both sides , if you think about it , has its pros and cons .<-->N
The elan for wearing uniforms is ebbing , and at the same time rising .<-->N
it is the same with those against it .<-->N
Basically what this means i sthat there will always be schools that follow the unfirom dress code and others that do n't .<-->N
And that is just life as it unfurls .<-->N
Matt , Holland No one argues about your way of clothing here at school and we do n't use schooluniforms , so i think they should be abolished indeed .<-->O
Larissa from New York I 'm 13 ... and i went to a private school for about 4years of my life having to wear a uniform .<-->N
Their not as bad as everybody says they are .<-->N
When i started going to a public school i realized how unorganized the school was without them .<-->N
I think we should have uniforms to prevent a lot of the problems forced upon students at school .<-->O
mm i agree lissette school uniforms should be abolished .<-->O
they dont allow freedom of expression , and dont allow children to be creative with what they are wearing .<-->O
Hugo Navarro we think uniforms shoul not be used in the Se Sd saunder i think u should abolish school uniforms amanda ireland yes in a way i think that it is right to have to wear school uniform as if u did n't and u wernt as well of as others in ur class it could lead to bullying Canada I think , scholl uniform is good Krystin , Iowa I am also doing a debate in Speech about school uniforms .<-->O
I am on the Affirmative side and i agree with haveing school uniforms because from what i have seen and heard they really do save money and there are many other points that i wont get into , but for people who say no to uniforms ... Is that all you can say ?<-->O
I mean seriously everyone that say yes for uniforms has something to back them up with but the ones that say no , all they can say is `` They dont show individualality '' BIG DEAL !<-->O
Do you really want to be searching EVERY SINGLE MORNING for some `` cool '' clothes to wear .<-->O
Think about that kt from california Our school has uniforms and they are sooo ugly !<-->N
Why does the school have 2 try 2 control every part ov our life ?<-->N
Paul from Stains -LRB- East Stains massive ! -RRB-<-->N
Seriously though , I wore a uniform for two years in a college -LRB- thats like last 2 yrs of highschool for you Americans -RRB- nearby here , and while they do help people maintane a level of conformity , like people have said before , you always know who is who -LRB- who is a punk , who is a goth , who is a partier -RRB- .<-->O
I think while they have many benefits , the majority of the arguements fail -LRB- cost , not really cheaper since parents need to buy two sets of clothes -RRB- with a quick analysis of the end result .<-->O
School uniforms -LRB- I think -RRB- are better at a younger age , -LRB- as kids do n't honestly care usually through age 12/13 -RRB- and then let people express themselves when they get up to highschool age .<-->O
Anonymous from Nowhere Well ... think about it .<-->N
I 'm for and against school uniforms .<-->N
They restrict our indivual identities and it 's annoying wearing the same thing over and over again , but on the up side you do n't have to think about what to wear every morning -LRB- I always have trouble picking clothes -RRB- , and sometimes school uniforms look better and cleaner and neater than regular clothes -LRB- Midriff baring tops ... ugh ! -RRB-<-->O
Melanie from Minnesota I Do n't think there should be school uniforms or school dress codes , I think we should be able to wear what we want !!!!! john gotti new york i am for school uniforms The Irish One from Jersey I read a lot of the previous comments before typing this -LRB- because I am bored -RRB- and I have to say that I am very disappointed at the stupidity of some of them .<-->O
I am not from England and want nothing to do with it .<-->N
I do , however , want school uniforms in my school .<-->N
Almost everyone at my school disagrees with me even though I want something everyone would like -LRB- black everything -RRB- .<-->O
Do n't get me wrong ; I do n't want to wear anything stupid -LRB- see picture above -RRB- and I do n't wish bad clothing on even my worst enemy .<-->O
I guess my whole point is `` why am I commenting about something that means so little to me ? ''<-->O
Tamia i do n't think d uniforms should be abolished because it shows represents the school and shows a sense of dicipline and belonging .<-->O
sometimes casual wear is just 2 inapropriate for school !<-->N
After skool , we can wear wat we want !?!? Jessica - Canada Seems like pre-teen stupidity is global .<-->O
rachel colchester i like school uniform because if you were on a school trip and you got lost people would know where you needed to be taken back to .<-->O
Tori from abilene I think that school uniforms are out of style it 's hard enough trying to fit in with others but uniforms make you complyed to be like everyone else .<-->O
Angela from Houston Uniforms do not help with clicks or the opinions of other students .<-->N
I wore a uniform to school almost my entire life and you can still tell who has the money because of the shoes , how clean their clothes are and the way they wear their hair .<-->O
Uniforms are just expensive and make parents feel better , but really do n't help .<-->O
Helen ... Devon Hehe makes me laugh reading all the negative comments about school uniform ... i left school a few years ago and i cant tell u how much i miss my trusty uniform.I 'm now at college and the pain of deciding wot to wear everyday is tiresome.balancing up comfort verses style verses when u last wore it ... or even if its clean!trust me school uniform has its advantages !<-->O
Cuz I hate school unifoms ames , brigg school uniforms should be abolished because the way we dress has nothing to do with what we learn.plus it cost loads .<-->N
Teachers dont have to wear them y should we !<-->N
amy , Brigg i think school uniforms should be abolished cos the way we look has nothin to do wiv the way we dress and we dont get too express ourselves plus it cost loads to buy them.skool uniforms suck 4eva !<-->O
Sofie from Sweden I 'm 17 and have never used a schooluniform , since we do n't have uniforms in Sweden .<-->N
I think that it does n't matter if you have a uniform or not , since we all look the same anyway .<-->O
We all use jeans and a t-shirt in a fashion colour .<-->N
But of course , I do n't know how it 's like to have one , so I ca n't say what 's best .<-->O
Simon from Truro i 'm 15 and i hate school uniform!it is so uncomfortable and identical to every1 else.they are trying to teach us to be individuals but they wont let us if we can express ourselves which they are restricting!in one way school is like prison !!<-->O
they both run on bells and they both require you to wear uniform .<-->N
so essential school is a prison for us teenagers.although you have the problem with money and your clothes sort of shows your wealth and bullyin could increase due to the more or less money some has , it is the schools priority to prevent that .<-->O
so they are putting us in uniform to save them less work.school uniform sucks !<-->O
tanya 12 i think school uniforms should be worn because it shows respect for your school.but i wouldnt like it if teachers wore uniforms because they do alot for the school.And my friends Katie and Anna got complimated by a women at nutgrove for wearing they uniform .<-->O
now would the women have said anything if the were wearing they own clothea Nicole from Bath School uniform gives people a sense of unity , saves thinking about what to wear each and every single morning , saves bitchyness , lets people concentrate on real things - and helps promote a common purpose for people at the school .<-->O
I hate it when we have a no school uniform day .<-->N
Then it seems all people seem to want to do is be horrible and pick holes in other people 's clothes .<-->O
It 's bad enough deciding what to wear at parties !<-->N
I have chatted with my friends about no school uniform days and they all agree that all they do is start fashion sense aguments .<-->O
We even had two girls fighting the last time !<-->N
People that do n't like uniforms have n't thought it through and seem to think they will be wearing the lastest fashions all the time - but in practice they 'll probably have to wear the same old clothes until they wear out wether they are in-fashion or not -LRB- parents are n't made of money -RRB- .<-->O
Also , there will always some rules on what you can wear .<-->N
Restrictions -LRB- like a bare midrif -RRB- etc. .<-->N
So then it 'll be who 's the coolest and can stretch the rules the most .<-->N
This is all STRESS !<-->N
We have enough to bother about with exams !<-->N
Anyway , that 's my opinion !<-->N
Tony ... Devon so , where do you anti-uniform spouters leave your personalities when you go to school then ?<-->N
cos I work in our local High St and believe you me you youngsters have plenty of mouth on you when going too and fro school ... not everything in life can be ` cool ' ... it seems the favourite arguement is ` Judge the book by its cover ' ... . .<-->O
funny , thought twas what was inside that counts ... .<-->N
but then again I 'm only an adult ` so what do I know , eh ?<-->N
... ... reaching out to the future rulers of this country ... -LRB- God help us -RRB- JEMMA 12 school uniforms make you look really big and people fight about what school they go to by the unifrom if they did not have the uniform we would see what school they would leave it and you go out after school and you have to go home to get changed where if no unitform you would not have to home to go to get changed and people get bully because they look big with out unitform you would not katie dorset i think all of these coments are great because im doing this in ict i personally think that school uniform **** Ellis , From Great Yarmouth I think school uniform is stupid there is no point wearing it because you are in school for 6 hours a day and who is going to see what you are wearing apart from teachers and other students and what has uniform got to do with your learning TahShanda Watson I 'm from Albany Ga. .<-->O
I think studens should not where uniforms because they can where what they want.I 'm not trying to say where any thing but they dont have to where uniforms .<-->O
Plus you are waisting your money spening it on uniforms.When you buy regular clothes you can where them out on the weekend too !<-->N
A Smith Bournemouth I agree with the person who stated that those who have posted here should concentrate more on their education than be concerned about school uniform .<-->O
Proper use of the spellchecker would not go amiss .<-->N
Uniforms are just that -- UNIFORM all are equal , no one need be frowned upon for not wearing the IN thing , whilst learning .<-->O
You are in education establishments to learn , plenty of time for self expression after school .<-->O
Do you think that the question of uniform should apply in all walks of life ?<-->O
reg walker living in swansea Judging by the quality of the postings , you young people would be better off putting all your efforts into learning the rules of spelling and grammar than into tedious and predictable messages which leave us no wiser than we were before .<-->O
marc i like uniform Rachael SA Well School has nothing to do with what you look like or what people think of you !<-->O
So why does it matter what you wear .<-->N
So karla Graceran get over your self and stop trying to look good and learn instead of being stuck up .<-->O
Thankyou that is all i have to say .<-->N
Sorry for being rude .<-->N
carleymi well my opinion is the kids should NOT have to wear the schools stupid uniforms because then that means that they dont have the freedom of speech to express their selfs Sarah , CT I think uniforms are good because that way you dont have to worry about being ridiculed and scorned for what you wear .<-->O
I would rather be judged for who I am personally than what I wear .<-->O
And what is with the BS about not being able to express yourself .<-->N
Everything you do expresses yourself : the way your style your hair , what kind of jewelry -LRB- girls -RRB- you wear or ties -LRB- guys -RRB- you wear , etc. is enough to express yourself and individualize yourself .<-->N
I am doing an essay on this topic for english right now and I have found that in schools where uniforms were introduced that overall school crime decreased 36 % .<-->O
So suck it up and quit the BS , the school district put the uniforms there for a reason , and it is NOT to make YOUR life horrible .<-->O
JLR what are uniforms hayley oz school uniforms shouldnt be abolished they are there for a number of reason being school representation and the health and saftey of the students Jessica Humpherson Australia im doing a debate in emglish why we should wear uniforms .<-->O
how can it take away your individuality its pathetic most public schools like someone said already most schools let you alter it to make you look different .<-->O
and what would you do if some stranger was just allowed to walk into you school and do whatever .<-->O
there was recently an incedent in another school , they dont wear uniform where a stranger from outside the school came into the girls toilets and malestered a young girl all because he was just able to walk in and not be reconised because he looked the same as everyone else .<-->O

Becki from yorkshire I think uniform should be ebolished .<-->O
My reasons for this are that it might be stressful for some people to keep up with the latest fashions , but what about us that do wan na keep up with the latest fashions and express our personality .<-->O
Ebolish uniform !!!!!!!!!!!! ps .<-->N
plz Gina from the Big C School uniforms are awesome !<-->N
im so much more accepted for who i am . .<-->N
because of me and not because of what my school uniform shows and dosent show ... Emma , Devon School and education is about personal development , therefor personal expression should come from personality first and formost .<-->O
Not wearing a uniform really should n't be an issue of expression .<-->O
karla garceran , panama hi , i think school uniforms sucks .<-->N
tey do n't let me show my great body and the skirts are way 2 big.i know boys will love to seee my great legs , that why school uiforms sucks !!!! nancy travis waynesboro the uniform issue shoul depend on the type of kids eg : i came down here from ny a few years ago .<-->O
there some of the shools were turning to uniforms because it kept the kids safe .<-->N
they are not picked on because they cuold not afford the up to date fashion and on the other hand it keeps kids from stealing clothes or jewery from others Annabelle from Cambridge Just an example as to why uniform is necessary , seeing as so many people seem to disagree with a system that has worked for hundreds of years , in eg the army , and in schools .<-->O
Imagine if football teams did not wear their own kit on the pitch - they would not be identifiable : every time a goal was scored , people would be confused about who it was for .<-->O
The kit -LRB- as I 'm sure many fashion-following people who buy football shirts know -RRB- represents the team , in the same way that a uniform represents the school .<-->O
When the England rugby team goes abroad , the white shirts with the English rose are a symbol of the team , and their achievements .<-->N

Eric / St. Louis I think that uniform are bad garret from new york school uniforms suck because we cant express areselves and they shuoldent move to public schools me potown their should be no unifoms because if i had to wear a uniform i would not go to school Louise From Wisconsin Hi , I think that school uniforms should still be worn .<-->O
This is because if we all do n't wear the same thing , then we will be judged .<-->N
Not by the way we think but the way we style ourselves and the type of groups where in .<-->N
So therefore , we should still have uniforms .<-->O

jim mcdoneld school bad RUSSELL WILLIAMS I DO NOT THINK CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE SCHOOL UNIFORM BECAUSE THEY SHOULD HAVE THERE OWN RIGHT TO WEAR WHAT THEY WANT Kerry-Plymouth I am in year 12 and i have had to wear unitorm all my life !!!<-->N
Now that i am in year 12 i dont have to wear one .<-->N
I think that the uniform should be kept because it makes everyone the same and single anyone out .<-->O
jo from IN We are doing a debate on school uniforms.There are alot of pro 's and con 's .<-->N
I work on the pro 's side and i think we should have uniforms .<-->O
B/c it reduces violence and eliminates distractions so you do n't have to worry about what your going to wear .<-->N
Its proven that having uniforms raises test scores .<-->N
It dos n't take away your individuality it opens more oppertunities to see things in a different way .<-->N
There are more pro 's than con 's for school uniforms .<-->N
These are just some of the pro 's .<-->O
I plan on taking this to present to our school board .<-->N
I think we will be able to change some kids minds on the issue .<-->O
That is what i am hoping .<-->N
I would write more but it will take up alot of space .<-->N
I feel very strongly about this .<-->N
Thanks for letting me voice my opinion .<-->N
rhea i am curently doin a speech persuading people against uniforms in english and there are many points either side of the argument but i have founs they are uncomfotable , have a lack of expression , ugli , costly , embarassing and can lead to bullying anway cuz there are lots of different ways a uniform can b altered with it still be accepted in schools .<-->O
ciara oklahoma city i think that we should be able to wear whatever we feel like wearing , but not nothing hoochie , profanity on shirts , or any thing that would represent a drug .<-->O
At hoover middle school we have to have our shirts tucked in , and it makes us not look like our usuall self .<-->N
when i get home i have to change and thats a lot of clothes to do when its time to wash so i dont like the fact of uniforms .<-->O
D'arci from columbia CA my school doesnt ware uniforms , but wat i have read , it sounds like they are bad .<-->O
i 'm doing an essay on pros & cons of unifoms .<-->N
-LRB- im going aganist them -RRB- they take away your individualality.is that how u spell it ?<-->N
uniforms do not stop violence , or make you pay attension more to your work.well i have to go brandon hall form virginia I think we should get rid of uniform s it takes away r freedom YOLANDA FROM B-MORE YES STUDENTS SHOULD WEAR UNIFORMS THIS KEEPS THE FOCUS ON SCHOOL WORK AND NOT WHAT YOUR WEARING .<-->O
CHILDREN CAN BE CRULE JUST BECAUSE ONE IS NOT WEAR THE LASTEST THE OTHERS FEEL LIKE ITS OK TO PICK ON OR TEASE THE OTHER CHILDREN SO YES I 'M ALL FOR UNIFORMS JESS - AUS yer sure uniforms SUCK and yes i agree that the world is a free country and we should be able to do what we want but seriousally do you want to get ridiculed and judged by how you look !<-->O
i mean if you wore the same piece of clothing for a couple of days in a row your peers would probally think oh shes to poor to a new outfit everyday etc. .<-->O
sure you mite get teased bout your uniform but at least you can show others that you take pride in your school though wat you wear !<-->O
Rhode thomas , Philadelphia Ithink that school uniform should be banned , because 1 .<-->N
the teacher 's do n't have to wear them .2 .<-->N
it deos not give us a chance to be ourselves !<-->F
and anywho , parents spend more money a year buying uniforms .<-->N
I do n't really fancy looking like everybody else anyway !<-->O
lollypop laura i think we should stick to uniforms so we are not judged by how we look also having no uniform means people getting bullied for not having top trends or expensive iteams .<-->O
Hannah from Totnes I go to KEVICC 's -LRB- the school that does n't wear uniform -RRB- and I think it 's great .<-->O
The whole school looks more colourful and inviting .<-->N
Some of the teachers have become more relaxed and have made the lessons more interesting and enjoyable to be in .<-->O
Students keep to thier individual styles and any form of bullying because of fashion is non-existent -LRB- as far as I can tell -RRB- .<-->N
I think the rest of Devon should give it a go .<-->N
EMILY CHILDREN SHOULD WEAR UNIFORM jennifer spence , platt bridge , manchester .<-->N
I definitely dont think that school uniform should be abolished , partly because school is somewhere to learn , not a way to show off the latest trends.Secondly because adolescent youths pick up on the smallest differences in their classmate 's appearance and quite often use them as an excuse to make their lives miserable.the only people who would benefit from no uniform are the well off children who have all the latest trends.However on the other hand facial peircings should be personal choice , speaking as a person with facial peircings I dont see why they offend people , it isnt any different to dying your hair.Everyone has the right to look how they feel comfortable.As long as the student is sure that they want a peircing and they have their parents consent , which at their age is the onyl one that matters then that should be enough.they shouldnt have to have goverenment permission to look the way they want to.The nazi 's tried to mold people into how they wanted them to look , seeing as the british government hated the nazi 's way of rulership , its scary that im noticing similarities .<-->O
charlotte from newcastle i think my school uniform is ` nt that bad compard to other schools -LRB- black pants or skirt , black blazer , white shirt , black shoes and a red and black tie -RRB- i dont like waering it but i prefer my own cloths better Philippa from London You are so wrong to think that you lose individuality by having to wear a uniform to school - especially a relaxed one like that at KEVICS !<-->O
Uniform is a great leveller .<-->N
It 's lovely not having to think too much about what you are going to wear first thing in the morning and it allows you to concentrate on much more important things like your relationships with staff and fellow pupils and of course ... your work .<-->O
Some of us are still wearing almost the same style of clothes we wore in the 6th form at Mansion thirty years ago -LRB- ie cords and a t-shirt -RRB- when we do n't have to dress up .<-->N
Because they are practical and comfortable of course .<-->N
And why do you think that denim jeans are such a success still ?<-->O
Surely the same reason plus the fact that we were n't allowed to wear them to school .<-->N
Make the most of your schooldays - you are there to work towards a much more satisfying future - life is so much more than a just a fashion show .<-->O
Kari Smith , Illinois I am currently a Senior in High school and I wish that our school would have a dress code .<-->N
My high school is very concerned about what we are wearing .<-->O
Clothes have always got to be the best and the most expensive .<-->O
I am really sick of spending so much money on clothes .<-->O
Truth be told i 'd be happy to shop at wal-mart but at my school that just is n't acceptable .<-->O
So i would like to have a school uniform , that way i am not constantly being judged by what i am wearing .<-->O
High School is enough of a challange ; I should n't have to worry about my clothes .<-->O
That 's just what i think !<-->O
Bev from HK I think the best conclusion is that students get a choice .<-->O
Optional Uniform !!<-->N
Hahahah ... Katia Kurchatova -LRB- NJ0 yes school uniforms should stay because soo kids like every boy and girl soposed to wear same things soo other people wont make fun of another person wearing ugly or stupid clothes .<-->O
Liz i think school uniforms are a waste of money and they are so ugly !!<-->O
they should amke a law against them Andy Hudson from Ronceverte , West Virginia I think that school uniforms are kinda stupid .<-->O
Graham from Barnstaple They did away with corporal punishment in schools and disciplin went out the door and children do what they like now , they seem to please themselves whether they learn or not or even bother to go to school , do away with uniforms and the kids might as well not bother with education at all , at least it might save the tax payers of this country some money Schrappe -- columbus , ohio I think that school uniforms are a great idea !<-->O
They take away pressure on the student to have the latest fasion and styles .<-->N
They also offer the student an identity and let them be a part of something bigger .<-->N
I only wish my home school would let us wear uniforms .<-->N
Most teens , when they think of the idea of school uniforms , they only think of what they want .<-->O
Yes , it has to do with the indiviual student , but it 's not like deciding what they want for dinner .<-->O
It 's a serious question that deserves a lot of thought from every angle .<-->N
Students need to consider the pros and cons of the situation and not just their own selfish desires !<-->O
james lee harbertonford i think it is a good idea what we want to wear to school Kaylea from Quakertown PA you chinese ppl dont know what you are talking about ... school uniforms are awesome !!!<-->O

Hannah Wilson ~ TN ~ I wouldnt mind school uniforms , Maybe a cute skirt with the right top and i think they would be cute !<-->O
But thats just my oppinion i think people should express themselves and their own feelings by what thye wear . .<-->O
if someone dresses bad , then other kids shouldnt get punished for their mistkaes . .<-->N
im happy right now , ive never had a scool uniform in my life and im just fine withuut them .<-->O

Hans Wilson ~ TN ~ I wouldnt mind school uniforms , but i dont like the fact that youn cant express yourself.I mean its not fair . .<-->O

tom bates - exeter expat in scotland Dear K8/Taylor/Will Australia , Yes I do make sense .<-->N
My posting stated clearly that if schoolkids put more effort into their schoolwork then exams would not be lowered in standard to match the lower academic performance of those schoolkids .<-->N
You can disgaree , of course , but the statement still makes grammatical sense .<-->N
What do you think DOES N'T make sense ?<-->N
oliver dobson Isle Of Wight In my school uniform i think i look more like a boo-bahh than a school boy but i admit i am a bit of a smelly teachers pet Emma , PLYMOUTH I used to go to SJH and I thought that the school uniforms looked smart and you could still mix fashion with them .<-->O
Now I go to college i 'm finding myself getting up earlier just to find something to wear .<-->N
SCHOOL UNIFORM SHOULD STAY .<-->N
It also shows that we can look smart and it makes British schools look better -LRB- although there the best anyway -RRB- .<-->O
I really miss wearing a uniform .<-->O
KEEP UNIFORMS .<-->N
K8/Taylor/Will Australia tom bates does not make sense .<-->N
you complain about the exam results from everybody else , when your own comment does n't make sense .<-->O
` If you lot put as much effort into your school work as you do into posting fatuous -LRB- look the word up -RRB- messages on this board , exams today would n't be the dumbed-down joke they are today .<-->O
Thank you for your kind attention ' worry about ur own exam result , before you worry about everybody else 's .<-->O
Dave frim Australia .<-->N
I am 16 years old and I wear a school uniform .<-->N
I like the fact that I can change out of my uniform when I get home from school , but all of the people that do not wear a uniform are basically still wearing their uniform when they get home .<-->O
I do n't believe that wearing a uniform restrict my personality or individualty .<-->O
I just get on with my studies and show my individualty in this manner .<-->O
My dad told me that he has been in the worforce for 35 years and has had to wear a uniform of some sort or another at the many companies he has worked for .<-->N
So i guess wearing a school uniform will prepare anyone for wearing a corporate uniform when they start work .<-->O
Jena from Pennsylvania If you all would stop complaining about uniforms maybe you would see the good in them .<-->O
When you out into the world -LRB- if you can think that far ahead -RRB- then you cant go against your boss and say that you do not want to dress up , he/she is just going to find some one else to do the job .<-->O
If you are really that much of an individual ... express it some other way , through your writing or artistic ways .<-->N
The clothes you wear are not a reflection of your personality ... personalities should be strong enough that you do not need to use cloth as a facade .<-->O
Sarah Essex I think it should be abolshed cos its old fashioned and really uncomfortable .<-->O
We should be able to wear what we wont and feel comfortable wearing it .<-->O
Loz n ' Jo We are both currently in year 11 and debating this topic in English .<-->N
The compulsory school uniform destroys the students individuality and freedom .<-->O
Our school is very controlling over school uniform and we obtain more detensions from the way in which we wear our uniform than not handing in homework for a whole term .<-->O
In compariison together the way in which our uniform is worn is a much bigger deal than bulling .<-->O
natile england school uniforms are bad some people get teased for whearing stupit uniform so what i say to uniform its BAD !!!!!!!!!!!! alex from leicester i used to think that uniform was the worst thing in the world whilst i was at secondary school.but now im at college where there is no uniform.which can be great because you can create your own individuality , but it means that there 's a LOT more discrimination against each other.u can get picked on by everybody else just for just dying ur hair a different colour or wearing something that u like but others do n't .<-->O
so i think its better to all wear the same rather than get picked on for what you wear .<-->O
sarah school uniform should never be put in any kind of school even privite school uniforms are expensive and sometimes you buy one and find out that they are not the exact color they want so you ca n't wear them and you just wasted $ 30 on something your never going to wear again .<-->O
tom bates - exeter expat in scotland If you lot put as much effort into your school work as you do into posting fatuous -LRB- look the word up -RRB- messages on this board , exams today would n't be the dumbed-down joke they are today .<-->O
Thank you for your kind attention DCW Dorset I wore school uniform at all the schools I attended .<-->N
It did not stop me from achieving the standards and results I needed for the rest of my life .<-->N
Expression of individuality should be reserved for after school and for when one has completed the education necessary to succeed in life .<-->O

pj spayde i dont like uniforms cuz im to small JORDAN willard ohio School unirms are gay brian mahl willard , ohio i think uniform cost more money and then we have to buy more cloths to wear out side of school and that cost our parents more money .<-->O
so i dont think uniform are good anon After reading the comments on the noticeboard , I have come to one conclusion .<-->O
I think some of the contributors should spend less time debating matters such as school uniform and more time working on how to spell and write grammatically correct English .<-->O
I can only say I am shocked at how poor the standard is .<-->N
cole ny school uniform is the gayest ever dark green blazer come on chris young they shuold be baned because they are boring and so horoble and in the summer time kids are geting to hot Jessica ; Columbus GA I think that poeple should not have to wear school uniforms because they do n't even show the students ' indivudality and they shoulde n't have to be forced to wear something that they really do n't like .<-->O

Farooq or Faz Leeds The school uniforms are just a waste of money just because of the logo they put 5 pounds to 10 pounds up Kaleb Secor , Willard Ohio i think that school uniforms i just dumd and stupid because i just want to show that im better than every one .<-->O
Mish Sussex I think we should keep school uniforms !<-->N
Some say that its expensive but it you wear it again and again until you grow out of it .<-->N
If you did n't have school uniform then you would spend just as much money sometimes even more on buying your own clothes and getting the latest fashhion and any way , you should be concerntrating on your work instead of trying to impress everyone else !<-->O
Katie MA I believe that uniforms are a good idea becuase we would n't have to buy another outfit for every day of the week and kids who has less money and could not afford expensive brand-name clothes would not feel out of place .<-->O
T Jang I think we should keep school uniform .<-->O
It 's better than buy another clothes we need at each seasons.It 's also look smart and neat but i tkink it 's style is old .<-->O
Chris P. Bacon School uniform is sad and no one likes so lets just get rid of it .<-->O
a hospital .<-->N
I think that the public schools should not have to force their students to wear uniforms because of the fact it takes away the individuality of the student .<-->O
The students learn much better when they are comfortable and not when they are forced to wear something that they do not like .<-->O
In some cases the parents can not afford or can barely afford the uniform and ends up waisting money on the uniform and not the supplies that the student will need .<-->O
mohamed from Afganisthan Hi my name is Karin and I am from Afganisthan .<-->N

bye michalea no i dont think school uniform should be abolished Ree/nc I think they should abolish the uniform policy number one the we `` kids '' constantly grow making the uniforms smaller and the uniforms are too costly a pair of uniform pand costs about $ 20.00 down here and the shirts maybe about $ 10.00 a whole outfit $ 30.00 it espicially people who ca n't afford uniforms i feel very strongly about this maybe every 4 months or sprit week we have free dress days for people who cant afford uniforms it will be easy to just put on a pair of pants or sorts and a t-shirt and go people are n't being pick on about what they wear to the extreme but mostly people who wants uniforms are PARENTS at my elemtry school they sent home a paper about the parents had to vote if they wanted uniforms or not my mother & father voted NO because they said that clothes express how we feel that day and our personialty of course many parents did n't feel that way and voted YES .<-->O
We come to school and all 1000 students are dressed just like you and i dont like people copying the way i dress and asking you were did you get you clothes from so they can go to the clothing store and get a outfit jus like it .<-->O
Parents of the children sya the reason i voted for the uniforms because guess , this is good because they look `` NICE '' what the world because they look `` NICE '' if you spent $ 100 jus on 3 pair of pants and 4 shirts they better look like a million dollars you know and when you wash the pants and shirts after you wear them guess what they shrink but anyways i vote yes they should abolish this stupid rule philippa havant I dont like uniform i dont see why have to where it and i think that we should stop uniform amediatly nicole -LRB- bradford -RRB- yes because you should be able to wear what you want Paige Georgia I think we should not have uniforms because it keeps us from our freedom and what we like .<-->O
This is a free country and we should be able to wear whatever we like and it should not be up to some one else .<-->O
Some people cant afford uniforms and it would not be fair .<-->O
Jessie & Jessica , Lawndale , NC We think uniforms are gay and they keep people from expressing their individuality .<-->N
amira mexico NO NIO NO NO NO NO N O NO Emma from Ireland Hi Donna , I do n't think it 's bad that you have to wear a short skirt for school , it teaches you to be ladylike -LRB- for instance to sit with your legs together and bend down properly -RRB- and also get used to the cold on your legs -LRB- especially if you 're not allowed 2 wear tights which we 're not -RRB- which can be useful because you might get a job one day where you have to wear skirts .<-->O
Dottie from Bainbridge I believe that the majority of you should put the uniform on and start worrying about your writing ability and speech problems .<-->O
Ruth , Bristol I hated wearing school uniform at school and it was n't even strict .<-->O
I think it seriously affected me dropping out of school .<-->O
I like college now I can wear comfy clothes and no one cares what you wear , at school probably because of the uniform , it was all about clothes !<-->N
Now I can focus on the work .<-->N
It may just be that uniform had negative connotations for me and putting it on therefore put me in a depressed mood .<-->O
When I am down I wear bright colours to cheer me up and fix my hair and make-up nice , so I have confidence to face the world , in my school uniform I had less confidence and therefore I think my education suffered as a result of required school uniform .<-->O
Btw I have no problem with dress codes e.g. no obvious labels and no skirts above a certain height and I suppose I would be ok with a system where you have some choice e.g. .<-->O
A particular style of V-neck in any colour .<-->N
Also what is the point of school uniforms most of the time , most kids do n't take pride in them so they look scruffy and once they finish school having worn a tie -LRB- if required -RRB- they will be very likely not to be required to ever wear one to work .<-->O
Also at a time of growing childhood obesity shouldn t children be encouraged to run around and play , how many 13 yr old girls -LRB- and other kids -RRB- are gon na do that in restrictive uniforms -LRB- e.g. skirts and tights and heeled shoes , white shirts and ties -RRB- .<-->O
And don t get me started on PE kit no wonder some many people turn against sport !<-->N
Chris Fareham School Uni should remain , providing it is comfortable and reasonably priced .<-->O

In many states in the USA S Uni is being introduced to prevent violence .<-->N

April , Louisville , Kentucky In my opinion I think uniforms SUCK !!<-->O

I think that uniforms are an essential part of the school experience as it helps to make you feel like part of the whole .<-->O
Kids these days wear clothes that are way too mature for their ages anyway , not a good idea to take that into schools is it ?<-->O
Sara Dorset couldn t care less im not bothered if we keep school uniform or not !<-->O

it also makes learning sorta fun alswell ???? Tiffanny from Carrollton I 'm 15 and I think we should have school uniforms .<-->O
When students at school where their own clothes they go against the school dress code .<-->N
Some students wear clothes to were a lot of their skin is showing sometimes way to much skin .<-->N
We should wear school uniforms or inforce the school dress code and make it work .<-->N

Asma - South Africa our government is in the process of getting rid of unifoms.here in south africa , all the schools have a uniform.i have two opinions on this topic .<-->O
firstly i think that they shouldnt go coz the unifom indicates that you are part of that school and the pupils discipline just flys out of the window .<-->O
then again i think uniforms should go coz the schools are to strict and the uniforms are too expensive .<-->O
Laura - Co. .<-->N
Durham I think we should keep a uniform but i also think that a blazer is way to much , and at my school girls have to wear navy trousers which are just soo hard to find , while the boys can wear any they like .<-->O

Taha hurstvill puibl school i think kids should be allowed to wear what ever they want and some kids feel comforable in mufti why do the teachers get to wear mufti there not being fair so thats what i think about school uniform KATHERINE SLOAN I strongly believe in school uniforms , i live in usa where kids get beat up , even killed by bullies stealing their shoes etc. .<-->O
Only private schools over here wear uniforms and they are looked upon as the cream of the crop and the most educated pupils .<-->N
It is fine for some kids whose parents can afford to buy `` cool '' clothes for school , but what about the ones who cant .<-->N
IN school photos it looks so nice and orderly when wearing the school colours .<-->O
Alot of schools out here are begging for the school system to regulate clothing and introduce uniforms .<-->N
schools in new york have already instrumented this and everyone , including the kids are happy .<-->N

keara I REALLLY WANT SCHOOL UNIFORMS AND I DONT ' HAVE THEM I WANT THEM SO BAD I WOULD GO OUTSIDE THE DRESS CODE AND SO WOULD MANY OTHERS JUST TO HAVE THEM.ALSO I THINK US GIRLS SHOULD WEAR SKIRT WE WOULD LOOK SO CUTE !!!!!! Ruben Reyes / from ; South Bend IN I think that we should all wear uniforms because of the fact that most of the kids are being discriminated for the close that they wear .<-->O
Most of those kids are either mexicans or black Erin , Invercargill Sosome kids want uniforms and some kids do n't , so why not let them have both .<-->O
Then some kids whoz parents havent got much money do n't have to worry and kids who hate uniforms can wear what they want .<-->O
Still I think uniforms sux and I personly do n't want to wear one Robert I think uniforms suck p.s Im 14 and love girls Mike , Australia I do n't think a uniform is a big deal .<-->O
Mine is n't bad although if you asked me in front of my friends or on TV I 'd say I do n't like it because that 's what every one says in public but I like not having to worry will I look daggy if I have chosen something dumb john invercargill school unifoms sux !!!!!!!!!! Tony invercargill School uniforms ... ... suck they should be banned uniforms do n't let kids wear clothes that we like and some parents ca n't afford uniforms it is n't far get rid of them .<-->O
nadog , invaercargill what are people talking about ... school uniforms suck ... . .<-->N
the government/teachers are trying to make us look like weirdos ... they should atleast ask the students for what they want and not what they think they want in a uniform .<-->O
They should ask the students of what they want so they can get a general idea and make a uniform that the students like and also the government/staff .<-->O
marco school uniforms ... ... . .<-->N
suck they should be banned !!!<-->N
Kane , Invercargill School uniforms are very good .<-->N
Poor kids would be bullied and chubby kids would wear poor clothesd to fit them .<-->O
Imagine in PE when a fat kid would run in shorts or short-shorts .<-->O
Run tubby tubby tubby !<-->N
michelle pearn from yelverton My brother and I think that wearing uniform is very smart it is a very stupid idea to abolish it .<-->O
School uniform should be worn as you are representing your school .<-->O
p.s I am 9 macilamary LA Yap i think school gals like us should wear skiirts ... ... . .<-->O
Mary Beth Georgia I DONT THINK SCHOOL UNIFORMS ARE GOOD BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO LOOK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE .<-->N
I LIKE MY AMERICAN EAGLE AND HOLLISTER CLOTHES .<-->F
I THINK IT MAKES ME DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE ELSE .<-->N
Rhonda from Exeter School uniform should stay We do n't want our schools becomming like American ones where the children are labelled by their clothes and often bullied for them .<-->O
Children take long enough getting ready for school without having to choose clothes every day .<-->O
Parents ' job would be a lot more difficult without it .<-->N
ken yorkshire a a former school govener uniforms should be abolished , when i was child in the war we had free school dinners my dad had died not my fault , in then days thrombosis he was a miner , they used to call out your name and then say free dinners i did not answer so I did without , kids should be all equal if parents have money or not , NO CLASS DISTINCTION distinction Rachel H. - Singapore Well , I guess every single school in the world has its own different and unique set of cultures and traditions .<-->O
Therefore , I think that it should be up to the authorities in charge of that particular school to lay down the pros and the cons about having and not having school uniforms based on the kind of students they have there -LRB- Rich , poor , boys , girls etc. -RRB- But then why blow up the fuss about uniforms ?<-->O
Is it like anyone is blowing up a riot over this issue ?<-->N
Whether or not we can or can not wear school uniforms , the one thing is the same .<-->N
Every school will have its rules , if sticks to uniforms , then there will be the routine checks .<-->O
If you can wear `` anything '' you want -LRB- so to speak -RRB- there will still be rules about what you can or can not wear .<-->O
-LRB- That makes it worst in western countries where there are four seasons , here in s ` pore its practically summer throughout ... so we do n't have to shop for wools -RRB- .<-->O
So basically , having no uniforms does n't mean that one will have more freedom , yah , maybe to express the individuality thing , -LRB- In s ` pore we do it with our personalities and lil ' stuff like our bags etc. -RRB- there will be more restrictions and frustrations.You wo n't be able to express your individuality without breaking a few rules .<-->O
In the end the one thing we all gain from both sides is-discipline Chris from Cornwall Ah , yes , they have abolished school uniform , but what ` rules ' do they still have about ` appropriate ' dress , hair , piercings , language , etc. .<-->O
Is it really such a reactionary move , or just a sensible way to save valuable staff time often wasted on needless uniform checks ?<-->O
Anthony - Leeds School uniforms are good in a way as long as they are not over enforced .<-->N
I have to wear my school uniform after school as well as during the day .<-->N
torbay there are two very strong sides to the argument so i think that schools should think carefully about the effects that removing school uniform will have on their specific school .<-->O
keviccs is a very eclectic school and so will have less drastic effects as individualism seems to be more accepted .<-->O
Kat , Plymouth There are good arguements on either side of this debate and some people have presented good arguements here .<-->O
Many of them however are somewhat incoherant and one ca n't help but think that perhaps they should concentrate in schools rather than complaining about uniforms ?<-->O
Mike ' 22 , from Jansen 's Cornell dude ... how unique can we be from wearing what we like ?<-->N
after all , we 're all brain washed by what is advertised ... do you really think you 're special ?<-->O
now i do n't think wearing a tie and a suit would make the next generation of kids do better in life , i do n't think dressing alike would stop the fights or angry voices in our heads ... if a school wants a dress code , then every kid should shave their heads ... if we increase a kids efficiency , his creativity would decline ... it 's not by choice but by the environment given to him , integrated with his innate consistently changing function ... maybe we should find a equilibrium between efficiency and creativity ... maybe what our children really need is understanding of compassion and self-restraint , rather than pride manifested by the delusion of the exterior ... `` i look smart in my uniform , '' by now , we should all know , that we do more ignorant things than things we do that could be considered as intelligent ... by now , we should all be aware of the fact that we make more mistakes than things we can learn ... since we do n't always learn from our mistakes , and we do n't always see them ... what are the problems we have today ?<-->O
lack of understanding lack of compassion lack of faith God is with us .<-->O
Tiger-H I think School Uniform is a bravo idea .<-->N
Not everybody in school is reach .<-->N
There is poor people .<-->N
You just do n't know a bout them because they did n't show or tell you they are poor .<-->O
Their parents have to use the only money to buy some cool clothes .<-->N
So they do n't feel embarrass in forn of their finds .<-->O
You know as a American Citizen you really have to think about this .<-->O
Sharon O'Neill As a mother i say yes to keeping school uniforms as ther will be too much competition .<-->O
There are people who ca n't just go out and buy BRANDED gear , therefore the school wear stays .<-->O
Sarah , Swansea My school uniform was n't awful , it meant black skirt or trousers , white blous , black v-neck jumper and a red/black tie .<-->O
It was comfortable enough and the only thing we had to complain about was the lenth of the skirts we could wear .<-->O
Mufti days were always fashion parade and for children between 10-16 wearing the right clothes on these days was desperately important so having every day as mufti would be a nightmare for many .<-->O
In 6th form we could wear our own clothes but by that age it seemed far less important to wear the `` right '' thing , so personally I feel that non uniform should be for the highest year groups in school .<-->O
Andrew ex King Ed Totnes Keep it !<-->N
King Eds is the only state secondary school for miles around , so is for rich , poor , cool , uncool .<-->O
All wearing the same removes pressure on kids and parents to have latest and greatest .<-->N
Come back school uniform second hand shop , where are you now ?!<-->N
Update uniform , definitely ; remove , no !<-->N
Tripp , Aberdeen At our school , our uniforms , meant to be - white shirt/blouse/polo , black cardigan or sweater with the logo , black trousers and black shoes with the school tie and most people do wear it .<-->O
However some people i.e - rebels , goths , skaters , punks , moshers .<-->N
etc -LRB- like me -RRB- do n't .<-->N
We wear blouses , jeans and trainers , all black but you can still tell that we 're pupils .<-->N
Yeah OK we might not look as smart as the uniform wearers but we definatly look better .<-->O
I have many facial piercings like my eyebrow , nose , lip , labret .<-->N
etc and I do get nagged sometimes by teachers who do n't think it 's part of school uniform but I 'm just expressing my individuality .<-->O
I hate the idea of everyone looking the same .<-->O
Wear what you want to school and be proud to stand out , just prepare for comments from teachers/staff who do n't have to wear crappy uniforms in the first place .<-->O
Krystal , Georgia Hi my name is Krystal , and I 'm in Highschool .<-->N
I think that we should not have to wear uniforms to school .<-->N
I mean yeah it will take the pressure off of the fashion , but then kids will find more personal stuff to pick on people about .<-->O
They will pick on the things that we ca n't help , things we ca n't change .<-->N
At least with our clothing , we can change what we wear .<-->N
So I think that wearing a school uniform will only cause more problems .<-->O
william No , I 'm a student and I think that our school uniforms reflect our history.I do n't think that we should rid our ourselves of them .<-->O
They have to me always refected prestige and discipline .<-->N
A seeming British trait .<-->N
We 're suffer extremely if the students are allowed to wear what they wish to our schools -LRB- no matter how questionable the attire -RRB- .<-->O
I 'm only 9 years old and I hope that my peers do not win this one .<-->N
Emma , Ireland Hi , I do n't agree that it 's good to get rid of school uniforms and I * definitely * do n't think it 's sexist for schools to say girls have to wear skirts as part of the uniform , or PE skirts or athletics briefs for sport .<-->O
I do n't think schools should just help you to pass some exams , they are there to help you prepare for adult life .<-->O
If you could wear whatever you wanted , most girls would wear jeans in winter and trakkie trousers for sports .<-->O
But if they make you wear -LRB- like at my school -RRB- a skirt and just ankle socks , and PE knickers for sport , your legs get used to the cold .<-->O
This i good because when you 're older you can wear dresses or skirts without getting cold legs .<-->N
shaz for redruth our uniforms not 2 bad as far as it goes but it is a pain i think we should be able to wear what we want because it costs our parents money to but when we could just wear clothes we already own.SCRAP IT .<-->O
Andy I think school uniform should stay in touch with everyone because they keep away the intruders from other schools .<-->O
delia , Singapore In Singapore , every school has its own uniform and that differentiates one school from another .<-->N
I think we look smart in uniforms .<-->O
With uniforms , one need not worry about what he/she will be wearing the next day or buy expensive clothes to keep up with fashion .<-->O
Whether you are rich or poor , we all look the same in uniforms .<-->O
Therefore , there is no discrimination aganist the poor .<-->N
Hence i feel that school uniforms should stay .<-->N
The champ Rocky i dislike school uniforms they arnt cool David Vawdrey school uniforms should be abolished because they arnt cool SAMITA DHANAPALA school clothes should be burned :-RRB- Amy from Sweden I live in a country where school uniforms do not exist and when I was a little girl I wished we would have school uniforms because then I would ` nt have to choose what to wear .<-->O
But is that reason enough ?<-->N
If there would be no uniform , some say that children whose parents can not afford cool clothes will get teased .<-->O
But children get teased for a lots of different reasons .<-->N
If it ai n't the clothes than it 's the glasses , the nose , the accent or their bad spelling .<-->N
The point is that it 's always something .<-->N
And that uniforms would improve children 's behaviour , come on do you honestly believe that good behaviour 's in the clothes ?<-->O
Children are children , with or without uniforms .<-->N
Clara S .<-->N
The idea of school unifoms is not the best idea because it does n't really show safety or unity at school .<-->O
it rather take aways the uniqueness of a person .<-->N
tom fisher i think school clothes should stay karly brogden No school clothes should not be abolished because people will bring there really good clothes and get holes and dirt all on there clothes .<-->O
sam broadhead I think that they should be abolished because people will get teased of what there waring .<-->O
Natarsha Quinlan No school uniforms should not be abolised because there would be to much competion with the clothes .<-->O
jquayle yes school uniforms should be abolished because there gay sam r its should be abolished because it would be easier to find your kids and it sucks clare form torquay i think that although the arguments for school uniform are very competent i think that school uniform should be abolised , although it may seem like a practical idea , when you are in the middle of winter with nothing but a pleated skirt and tights to keep you warm against the elements i think that you might change your ideas about it aswell.the matter about bullying is that i think tat peolpe underestimate childern , i ca n't denie the fact that bullying goes on , but wiether you are fat , slim , short or tall a bully will not stop bullying , the problem is with the child that bullies not with the victims clothing .<-->O
i am a 14 year old school girl and i think we should get rid of uniform Ed While at school I was not keen on school uniform -LRB- all my schools had a formal uniform -RRB- .<-->O
But looking back on them with hindsight I would agree they are a good idea as they did create an instant atmosphere of belonging to the school and were quite smart .<-->O
Also there was no distraction of the latest fashions from academic studies , or bully/victimising people who did n't conform to the latest fashions .<-->N
As for the Individuality/Personality/Uniqueness argument , a persons clothing just shows their fashion sense/deepness of pockets , I think true personality is expressed by a persons actions .<-->O
I find it ironic that following fashion is thought of as showing uniqueness by some people ... james quayle it should be abolished because it sucks bigtime Kali Brown I think uniforms are a great idea .<-->O
First they promote safety .<-->N
It makes it easy for school adminstration to spot people who do n't belong on campus .<-->N
They promote a sense of belonging .<-->N
Provide for less distraction in the classroom .<-->N
Yes they are cheaper .<-->N
Instead of buying an outfit for everyday of the week , an average student would only need three uniforms to rotate through each week .<-->O
Parents and students would not have the `` What to wear issues '' in the morning .<-->N
There are many other reasons that support uniforms , but here are a few to get started .<-->N
dawlish NO school uniform should never be abolished , if you think bulling is bad now you could imagine what it would be like without a uniform think of the children who cant afford the up to date cloths what will they go through .<-->O
anyone who say abollish school uniform is mad Oliver from Bedfordshire I think that uniforms are a very good thing .<-->O
Where people say they are more expensive than brand clothes , that 's comparing them to one peice of clothing !<-->N
If you had to wear a different peice of expensive clothing each day , it would easily top the price of uniform .<-->O
For lots of the people that think they 're bad , you should see what its like without them .<-->O
With uniforms , people are better behaved as it enforces discipline , the more they are enforced , the better .<-->O
If they are not enforced well , then they arent very helpful .<-->O
If enforced well , behavior and discipline , and therefore schoolwork ratings increase .<-->N
Sylvia Hungary Here in Hungary we do n't have to wear a uniform!But In my view wearing a uniform is very good thing!Because in my scool there are very rich and poor students too!And it is very annoying when the elit kids always say that the poor kids are so shabbily dressed!And for example if you wear a uniform there are n't a wild gap betveen the poors and the rich !<-->O
I 'm green with envy that you could wear a uniform !!!! Alistair Myles from Totnes As a former KEVICC student I was thrilled to hear that they had abolished school uniforms , I could never believe they were such a bone of contention for some less than reasonable teachers who quite literally would go bright purple and scream with rage if the code was deviated from .<-->O
I see no reason to make people all look the same at such an early age , how much practice does it take to get into wearing a uniform for work for gods sake ?<-->O
certainly not 11 years .<-->N
How about letting kids enjoy themselves and express themselves freely while they 're still young enough to not have to worry too much about all the presures of adult life .<-->O
And as for those people who are `` furious '' about this move I think I speak for the majority of fun and freedom loving individuals when I say `` Get a life ! ''<-->O
Well done Mr.Jones. :-RRB- Karla - Totnes So Stephen Jones feels that uniform is a British institute , I have no problem I am proud to be British .<-->O
So children should have the right to show individuality through clothing - does this mean the Armed forces should also have that right .<-->O
Are big business like Marks and Spencer going to still employe these children when they refuse to wear the company uniform because Stephen Jones has taught them they have a right .<-->O
I find it interesting Stephen Jones is still wearing his uniform - suit and tie a very British costume for a British headmaster !<-->O
Rowan Hodgson-Newton Abbot I go to Coombeshead College and although our uniform is better then most its about time it were removed .<-->O
The reason every time is that children from less fortunate backgrounds would feel pressured into having to have the latest brands .<-->O
This has no standing because the price of uniforms today is almost double what brand names are .<-->N
Also these less fortunate people have a life outside school anyway and would wear brand names .<-->O
It would be great to do away with uniforms just so I do n't hear another teacher say ` Why are you wearing trainers ' .<-->O
spongebob sqaurepants my school uniform is much more wierd than all of yours as mine is sqaure shaped so you lot better stop complaining or i will clog up this whole page full of pointless letters about nothing in paticular so shut it by by Johnson I love uniform actually ... That was the sign of school and student ... Steve - Okehampton Uniforms give a sense of achievement and of ` belonging ' .<-->O
I was proud to proclaim that I was good enough to make it to my Grammer school in Surrey but the most wonderful moment was having my RAF pilots ` wings ' pinned to my uniform - linking me to people like Douglas Bader , Guy Gibson and the ` few ' who fought the battle of Britain .<-->O
A uniform should be worn with pride - and respect for those who have gone before .<-->O
carla santa cruz i think that we dont need uniforms Misty Melhorn - Florida If you ask me , I think that the school should take uniforms out and let the students wear what they please .<-->O
I mean if they want us to be individual and unique then they should let us ware the cloths that presents our personality , but when we have to wear uniforms that takes our privaledge away .<-->O
So I would think if they took the way we want to dress away then they should n't be able to ban peircings .<-->O
I do believe that it should n't matter what we have peirced just as long as we attend school .<-->O
That is not really the school 's right to say what we can have peirced , it is our parents choice and not the schools.Yes the school may have anavtages of what we ware to school , but they should n't have the authortiy on what our parents allow their children to get pierced.To take you to where I want to go in this message , is if the schools take our rights to wear the cloths we want to present our - selfs then we should at least be able to show our personality through the way we look and that would be by the peircing we may have .<-->O
dan from south brent Totnes is a top place , i had many happy years there .<-->N
School uniform should stay there is far to much darck sarcasm inthe class room scott from plymouth skool uniforms are crap we shunt have them Tooba USA I think school uniforms are a drag ... do n't Americans always say that America is the land of the free ?<-->O
well , then freedom of expression is something they should be able to accept and respect .<-->O
I think making students wear such hideous uniforms takes away a students uniqueness .<-->O
Why should students have to wear uniforms and not teachers ?<-->N
if your gon na make a rule then I think everyone should abide by it .<-->O
stacey , paignton i dont think uniform should be banned , the reason being is that , if you get lots of kids dressed in really nice clothes and one or two people cant afford nice clothes then that can cause bullying .<-->O
anothe reason is that if you are wearing school uniform it advertises the school , even if the jumpers are a pain to wash , as my mum knows from washing my old jumper .<-->O
Matt from Georgia , USA As a person in the USA who has attended one public school , three private schools and going on to a fourth for my post-seconday education , I have experienced that dress does play a vital role in learning .<-->O
To say that dress does not matter or have an affect on behavior and the progress of a school is to reject the practice of business , and church dress .<-->O
It does have an influence on the mind both subconsciously and obviously the conscious .<-->O
Here over the Atlantic , most Public schools do not have uniforms , but they are becoming more and more popular .<-->N
However the word uniform is not as precise , as Americans tend to do to words .<-->N
Anything which limits the wardrobe to a certain brand or certain assortment of colors or styles is deemed a uniform .<-->O
The lack of that structure obtained through a uniform or a dress code -LRB- more common -RRB- does contribute to the general failing of the public education system in the USA While attending public school for my first seven years -LRB- k-6 -RRB- clothing did become an issue and somewhat of a competition .<-->O
At the private schools a dress code did make a difference since I was more accustomed to wear t-shirts and jeans all the time and it did improve my grade and transition into more difficult work .<-->O
In my first year in high school the dress turned into just khaki trousers , dress shoes , and a collared shirt .<-->O
We would walk the campus with some of the teachers commenting on how we were all school clones .<-->N
Indeed , he was correct , we were more of a unit than individuals and I personally felt the atmosphere created by the strict dress code hindered creativity .<-->O
Of course I could continue , but who wants to hear another American ramble eh ?<-->N
david thomas glassgow itsgay cara , brighton i think school uniform is ok , but it is uncool chris Glasgow I just left school , but i wore a white shirt , school tie , blazer , black trousers , black shoes , we also had a school polo shirt but i hated that , school uniforms are cool , they are nice , comfortable , i wore them all the time , even after school .<-->O
Jason Evens , Leeds I have just returned from a 2 week visit to us schools where they have no uniform - all students were well behaved and motivated and I believe the idea that a uniform creates discipline and good standards is a complete fallacy .<-->O
What I have learned in the USA is that the way to obtian good standards and good behaviour is to treat students with respect and as individuals , to provide them with the best faciloities and a wide range of extra-curricular opportunities .<-->O
That way they actually want to be at school and have plenty to keep them occupied rather than resort to misbehaviour to entertain themselves and enliven their otherwise dreary school experience .<-->O
i know that following fashion trends migfht be a concern but this only tends to be the case on non-uniform days which are something of a rarity .<-->O
Make non-uniform standard and students will soon tire of dressing to impress everyday .<-->O
mike hunt its very itchy and red i tried talkin to the teachers about it but they could help , i would like it to be gone , why must i have it , other people dont Dan hi im 12 and i go to oakmeeds in burgess hill i think that school uninform sucks and it is ichy and far to expensive and it is very hot in the summer but now its is time for me to say goodbye i am curently in IT in b9 and we are stuying school uniform ha what a coincedence and the time is 9:24:36 and its is thursday the 26th of june 1934 ben dover school uniform is gay i would rather wear a slimy banana skin Tillikrante i think that school uniform is a marvoulass idea as you can tell which school you go to but i think that it is also a very bad idea because its ichy and not in fashon .<-->O
but those people who think that school uniform sucks are very very very very very very very very very very very very silly.now a little bit about me i am 5 years old and i go to siliasn school in sri lanka.we dont wear school uniiform because non of us can afford it bye .<-->O
daryl page school uniform is so boring and pointless i 'd rather wear a tesco shopping bag paul im 12 and go to oakmeeds in burgess hill and i think school uniform sucks and we all look the same so we called our friends names Jade I do n't like scool unform because people stare at us when we are coming out of school and it spooks us out because wer only in year 7 ponarnie school uniform sucks teachers dont have to wear any uniform atall amy i dont like our school uniform because its plain and boring !<-->O
sexy becca i think that skool uniform should go !!!!!!!!!! 1 Rob I was proud to wear a school uniform and it was good to be associated with the school I attended .<-->O
Now that my children are about to start school , I am pleased that they too will be wearing school uniform for a number of reasons .<-->O
Firstly , I believe it gives pupils a sense of identity and association with their school and the community that that brings .<-->N
It also helps distinguish between school-time and home-time , something I can associate with each even when I replace my suit with jeans and t-shirt .<-->O
The occasional dress-down day then becomes more relaxed and fun .<-->N
Finally , it is one less pressure on parents and children when uniforms are worn - keeping up with the Jones ' tends only to lead to frustration and upset for all concerned .<-->O
I am in favour of school uniforms !<-->N
Richard Mr Stephen Jones , the Principal of King Edward the Sixth Community College will have from September 2003 one less problem to worry about ; No School Uniform .<-->O
Perhaps the `` good atmosphere '' is a reflection of the School having a uniform , but only time will tell if his decision is correct .<-->O
The `` Uniforms '' greatest asset to a School is uniformity .<-->N
If that is not a future requirement for King Edwards ' then Mr Jones ' decision is acceptable .<-->N
The other strong asset of `` Uniforms '' is the automatic reference one has as to what has to be `` ready for school '' .<-->O
This applies in future employment as well , just take a look at the Nurses , Police , Banks , Supermarkets , factories and production centres .<-->O
This discipline is therefore not wasted on young people at school , as the majority who advance their educational qualifications will encounter uniforms for the rest of their working days !<-->O
The universities and colleges will be the `` zone '' free from uniform , where their individuality and personal skills become the important issues for their future .<-->O
It 's quite obvious why a school will drop the uniform if young teenagers are given the opportunity to make comments and decisions on this subject .<-->O
It could be compared with young recruits joining up in the Army , Navy and Airforce and being told that as this is a `` very happy atmosphered '' ship or squadron , that they would be free to dress as required as their individuality can come through as necessary .<-->O
A Parental ballot/referendum would be another important indicator as to whether the decision made by Mr Jones is for the better or worse of King Edward the Sixth Community College .<-->O
Shannon I am doing a Debate in school and it has tought me alot.When I started this project , i did n't want uniforms , but as i learned more i noticed that their are good and bad things about uniforms for example , a bad thing about it is that with uniforms it takes away a uniqueness in a person they need individuality to express themselves.a good thing is that no one gets made fun of because of what they wear ... if you have any questions on uniforms please e-mail me xolildancinangelxox@yahoo.com Lauren i a also doing a debate on school uniforms and i think that when parents make their kids wear something that they want them to wear then the kids dont get a sence of style and that they are copying other people .<-->O
BOB DYLAN I LIKE SCHOOL UNIFORM IT IS WICKED GUY Brent I think uniforms should be gone FOREVER .<-->N
Uniforms take away a person 's unique characteritics .<-->N
These characteristics are what distinguish us from other people .<-->N
louise there are good and bad things about wearing uniform and I think that we should be able to choose the next school we go to only after we have seen the uniform and not have to go with what are parents want Scotty I am doing a debate at school I find that school uniforms limit self expression and for this reason I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABOISHED !<-->O
Holly De Havilland I am doing a debate at school and the topic is `` school uniforms should be abolished '' i am on the negative and apart from just saying that i strongly believe that school uniforms should NOT be abolished i am only 11 and already i see that importance or them .<-->O
i peronally do n't really like wearing a uniform but the good points sure outway the bad points .<-->O
like i mean what about the equality and simplicity that they provide and do n't forget the safety and security !<-->O
like take bullies for instance BIG problem ultimatly no-one can wipe it out but they can help decrease the number of children being bullied because their clothes are n't the latest or they do n't have 1,000,000 pairs of shoes what about all this money where does that come from ??<-->O
like i know a girl who is in this position and every day she comes home more and more miserable that also affects grades .<-->O
what time would it take to choose what to wear everyday ??<-->N
do n't you already waste enough time on the weekends .<-->N
what about the wear and tear on all your favourite clothes .<-->N
soory for taking up so much time but i had to tell someone my opinion .<-->O
Hayley I think that wearing your own clothes to School each day would lead to bullying .<-->N
Quite a lot of parents can only afford to buy one item of expensive clothing .<-->N
With the child wearing this same item every day wont they get bullied ?<-->N
Ian Uniforms give students a sense of identity and pride in their school and community .<-->N
It also saves perhaps less well off parents from being embarassed by the inevitable expense of teenage fashion .<-->O
Craig Hooper - Bournemouth I think everyone has the right to express themself.i understand , as with work you need to be professional.this may include wearing a uniform.however , your hair style and the choice to pierce yourself should be acceptable!it is a part of the individual 's identity.i am currently trying to put this oppinion accross to the work environment and employers.but i alone am just a small voice .<-->O
Vicki I think its sexist that girls have to wear skirts , so I think if schools insist on enforcing a uniform they should allow us girls to wear either trousers or skirts .<-->O
What do other girls think ?<-->N
Fatimah Yes , I believe that School should consider wearing Uniform .<-->O
When i was in high school , it was all about fashion ans WASTE parents ' money on new and expense clothes .<-->N
I wish we had school Uniform .<-->N
Now that I am an college student , in my current shool we do wear uniform and I LOVE it .<-->N
it is easy , you do not have to worry about who will look HOT ... COOL ... or what ever , because we all feel great ... free ... and happy ... to wear our uniform .<-->O
ashley from singapore i think school uniform should never be abolished , because it enhanced one 's sense of belonging to school and we should integrate and not stand out from the rest .<-->O
NIKKY I believe that school uniforms should be DEFINATELY abolished for they do n't make students feel confident and free.Abolishing them would be well appreciated by fellow students of our schools ry they should be abolished because they are plain and are irritating wearing them every day .<-->O
lucy Smith 28 Polperro As a parent i find school uniform very costly and struggle to keep up with the everchanging uniform codes therefore i believe uniform should be abolished -LRB- american high schools cope !!! -RRB-<-->O
John -LRB- Host -RRB- How strongly do you feel about the abolotion of school uniform ?<-->N

Let them know that you saw this on the BBC Devon website and they will call you back .<-->O
Ally I think that school uniforms should DEFINATLY be abolished !<-->N
In school , I was taught to be an indidvidual !<-->N
And then other schools obviously do n't care about individuality .<-->O
Also what if someone ca n't afford it ?<-->N
And I do n't think that clothes have a special power to magically make children get better grades !<-->O
Simon from Tonbridge I attended a school where there was a strict - but sensible - attitude to uniform and I have taught in a school where there is a similar attitude and at a school where there is no uniform .<-->O
I have no hesitation in saying that pupils have a better attitude to their work , a greater pride in their school and behave better when the school has a strict uniform policy .<-->O
Is not following fashion a voluntary act of wearinga uniform ?<-->N
Katrina I went to KEVICs and the uniform there is already really relaxed , no ties are worn -LRB- unless you want to ! -RRB-<-->O
and you basically just have to wear dark blue with a light blue shirt ; it allows for a broad level of individuality , which anyone who has seen a KEVICCs student will already know .<-->O
The uniform does n't differentiate between girls and boys and no stupid and unnecessary sportswear is pressed on students anymore -LRB- unlike the ridiculous briefs that were worn there a few year ago -RRB- .<-->O
Basically , the way I see it , all the bad points against having a uniform -LRB- no individuality , expensive , restrictive , sexist -RRB- have already been removed but all the negative and obvious points against not having a uniform remain ... KEVICCs is a school to be proud of and I know I was pleased to show I was part of it .<-->O
Plus it saves a lot of time in the morning !<-->N
And to Janie Rezner : er , no .<-->N
Do you think a person can only be unique through their clothes ?<-->N
Oh dear .<-->N
Rebecca Regards all this stuff about ` individuality ' , people wo n't actually dress any differently and will still look like clones .<-->O
Look at students , and sixth formers .<-->N
Most of them are in identical clothes .<-->N
Also , uniform is good for discipline , cheaper than having to buy brand new clothes all the time and also prevent bullying about clothes , which is bad enough in schools as it is .<-->O
Carlyn , Age 11 I think that uniforms should be abolished becuase are n't we supposed to be unique .<-->O
Sara I dont mind my school uniform , however when my school insists I wear a gym skirt for pe , I believe we should be allowed to wear what we like for sports .<-->O
Mike Take pride in your school by being identified .<-->N
We live in Canada and it is the exception rather than the rule to have a school unifrom .<-->O
I read about not being able to afford the uniform and not being able to express oneself .<-->O
Please be assured , that although the initial expense is high , in the long run it works out less expensive simply because after the uniform is purchased , you go into a maintenance mode .<-->O
As for expression , does one need cloathing to do that .<-->O
It is my experience that it is the person that stands out and not the cloathing they wear that makes them what they are .<-->N
Stay with the uniform .<-->N
PS I like Kerrys comment re uniform update .<-->O
rosy School Uniform should be worn as u are respenting your school .<-->O
Some people ca n't afford to buy clothes and maybe bullied .<-->N
Janie Rezner I 'm amazed you still make children wear uniforms -- you must be back in the dark ages !<-->O
Always diminishing the uniqueness of the person -- yes ?<-->N
laura gallagher i think that uniforms or good in school as they dont identify not so wealthy families and not giving them the opurtunity to get bullied Kerry If a school is considerng abolishing their uniform , perhaps an update on the style would be more appropriate than totally losing it .<-->O
And after all , where is the fun in destroying your favourite top after your last exam ?<-->N
10 years on I still have the shirt my friends and teachers signed on my last day , complete with my tie glued and stapled to it !<-->O
Kerry School uniform should not be abolished .<-->N
Some families can not afford to dress their children in the latest fashions , therefore adding another level of bullying if some children are not `` appropriately '' dressed .<-->N
A uniform cuts out this sort of discrimination .<-->N
linda my official school uniform had to be bought from a specific - expensive - outfitters which my family could not afford .<-->O
but we were not poor enough to get any grants .<-->N
I stuck out like a sore thumb in my ` not quite right ' uniform .<-->O
Out of school I dressed rather outlanishly - in retrospect a sort of rebellion .<-->N
Tony from Dawlish I 'm 15 and I find it really restricting to have to wear a uniform - we are all just clones of one another , it does n't allow us to express ourselves .<-->O
I think uniforms should be abolished .<-->N

Mr Laws said : Costs at the start of a school term can quickly add up , particularly for families with several school age children .<-->N

Do uniforms make schools better ?<-->N
For the past decade , schools , parents and students have clashed over the issue of regulating student attire .<-->N
In 2007 , cases involving an anti-Bush T-shirt in Vermont , an anti-gay T-shirt in San Diego and Tigger socks in Napa , California , made their way through the courts , causing many to wonder whether this debate will ever be resolved .<-->O
Meanwhile , researchers are divided over how much of an impact if any dress policies have upon student learning .<-->O
A 2004 book makes the case that uniforms do not improve school safety or academic discipline .<-->N
A 2005 study , on the other hand , indicates that in some Ohio high schools uniforms may have improved graduation and attendance rates , although no improvements were observed in academic performance .<-->O
Why do some public schools have uniforms ?<-->N
In the 1980s , public schools were often compared unfavorably to Catholic schools .<-->N
Noting the perceived benefit that uniforms conferred upon Catholic schools , some public schools decided to adopt a school uniform policy .<-->N
President Clinton provided momentum to the school uniform movement when he said in his 1996 State of the Union speech , If it means teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets , then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms .<-->O
The pros and cons of school uniforms According to proponents , school uniforms : Help prevent gangs from forming on campus Encourage discipline Help students resist peer pressure to buy trendy clothes Help identify intruders in the school Diminish economic and social barriers between students Increase a sense of belonging and school pride Improve attendance Opponents contend that school uniforms : Violate a student s right to freedom of expression Are simply a Band-Aid on the issue of school violence Make students a target for bullies from other schools Are a financial burden for poor families Are an unfair additional expense for parents who pay taxes for a free public education Are difficult to enforce in public schools Uniforms vs. dress codes Schools and districts vary widely in how closely they adhere to the concept of uniformity .<-->O
What s a dress code ?<-->N
Generally , dress codes are much less restrictive than uniform policies .<-->O
Sometimes , however , dress codes are nearly as strict , as in the case of a middle school in Napa , California .<-->N
This particular school s dress code required students to wear solid colors and banned images or logos on clothes .<-->N
When a student was sent to detention for wearing socks adorned with the image of Winnie-the-Pooh s friend Tigger , the girl s family sued the school district for violating her freedom of speech .<-->N
In August of 2007 , the district announced it would relax its dress code for the time being to allow images and fabrics other than solid colors .<-->O
The district superintendent , while admitting that banning images on clothes raises concerns about the restriction of political and religious speech , announced his intention to move soon toward implementing uniforms in the district .<-->O
Uniforms are certainly easier for administrators to enforce than dress codes .<-->N
Consider two recent examples of students challenging dress codes through the courts .<-->N
In June of 2007 , the United States Supreme Court upheld a lower court s decision affirming a Vermont student s right to wear a T-shirt depicting President Bush surrounded by drug and alcohol images .<-->O
The school had suspended the student , not for the anti-Bush political statement , but for violating a dress code that prohibits drug and alcohol images .<-->N
The courts , however , disagreed with the school and found that , because the images referred to Bush s alleged past use of cocaine and alcohol , they were protected as free political expression .<-->O

Am I failing as a mom ?<-->N
Dealing with the unpredictable behavior of an ODD child 6 myths about respect When parents disagree | Through a child 's eyes In March of 2007 , the Supreme Court vacated or set aside the decision of a lower court upholding a San Diego high school s suspension of a student for wearing an anti-gay T-shirt .<-->O
The school argued that the T-shirt was hateful and inflammatory .<-->O
The Supreme Court s action essentially struck down the school s argument and upheld the student s right to free speech .<-->O
In both of these cases , the schools attempts to protect students from drug and alcohol images or hateful speech were reversed in favor of free speech .<-->O
To clarify the matter somewhat , the Supreme Court ruled in June of 2007 in favor of a school in Alaska that had suspended a student for displaying a banner reading Bong Hits 4 Jesus .<-->O
The court ruled that the reference to drugs in this case had no political message and could indeed be seen as advocating drug use .<-->O
Check with your school to see what the dress code is , as they can be fairly specific .<-->N
In Tulsa , Oklahoma , for example , the dress code prohibits : Decorations -LRB- including tattoos -RRB- that are symbols , mottoes , words or acronyms that convey crude , vulgar , profane , violent , gang-related , sexually explicit or suggestive messages Large or baggy clothes -LRB- this prohibition can be used to keep students from excessive sagging -RRB- Holes in clothes Scarves , curlers , bandanas or sweatbands inside of school buildings -LRB- exceptions are made for religious attire -RRB- Visible undergarments Strapless garments Bare midriffs , immodestly low-cut necklines or bare backs Tights , leggings , bike shorts , swim suits or pajamas as outerwear Visible piercings , except in the ear Dog collars , tongue rings and studs , wallet chains , large hair picks , or chains that connect one part of the body to another What s a uniform ?<-->O
One school might require white button-down shirts and ties for boys , pleated skirts for girls and blazers adorned with the school logo for all .<-->O
Another school may simply require that all shirts have collars .<-->N
In Toledo , Ohio , elementary school students have a limited palette of colors that they can wear : white , light blue , dark blue or yellow on the top half and dark blue , navy , khaki or tan on the bottom half .<-->O
Toledo girls are allowed a fairly wide range of dress items , however : blouses , polo shirts with collars , turtlenecks , skirts , jumpers , slacks , and knee-length shorts and skirts .<-->O
Boys have almost as many choices : dress shirts , turtlenecks , polo or button-down shirts , pants or knee-length shorts .<-->N
When Toledo students reach junior high , they are treated to one more color choice : maroon .<-->N
What research says about school uniforms Virginia Draa , assistant professor at Youngstown State University , reviewed attendance , graduation and proficiency pass rates at 64 public high schools in Ohio .<-->N
Her final analysis surprised her : I really went into this thinking uniforms don t make a difference , but I came away seeing that they do .<-->O
At least at these schools , they do .<-->N
I was absolutely floored .<-->O
Draa s study concluded that those schools with uniform policies improved in attendance , graduation and suspension rates .<-->N
She was unable to connect uniforms with academic improvement because of such complicating factors as changing instructional methods and curriculum .<-->O
University of Missouri assistant professor , David Brunsma reached a different conclusion .<-->N
In his 2004 book , The School Uniform Movement and What It Tells Us About American Education : A Symbolic Crusade , Brunsma reviewed past studies on the effect of uniforms on academic performance .<-->N
He also conducted his own analysis of two enormous databases , the 1988 National Educational Longitudinal Study and the 1998 Early Childhood Longitudinal Study .<-->N
Brunsma concluded that there is no positive correlation between uniforms and school safety or academic achievement .<-->N
Meanwhile , the movement toward uniforms in public schools has spread to about a quarter of all elementary schools .<-->N
Experts say that the number of middle and high schools with uniforms is about half the number of elementary schools .<-->N
If uniforms are intended to curb school violence and improve academics , why are they not more prevalent in middle and high schools , where these goals are just as important as in elementary schools ?<-->O
Because , says Brunsma , It s desperately much more difficult to implement uniforms in high schools , and even middle schools , for student resistance is much , much higher .<-->O
In fact , most of the litigation resulting from uniforms has been located at levels of K-12 that are higher than elementary schools .<-->N
Of course , this uniform debate is also one regarding whether children have rights , too !<-->O
It s a big issue A new trend is the mounting pressure to establish dress codes for teachers .<-->N
Apparently the same casual mind-set toward revealing outfits is cropping up in the ranks of our teachers .<-->N
The debate over uniforms in public schools encompasses many larger issues than simply what children should wear to school .<-->O
It touches on issues of school improvement , freedom of expression and the culture wars .<-->O
It s no wonder the debate rages on .<-->O
------------------------- 9 .<-->N
Reasons Why Schools Should or Should n't Use Uniforms According to the National Center for Education Statistics , during the 2009 to 2010 school year , about 19 percent of public schools required students to wear uniforms , an increase from only 12 percent in the previous year .<-->N
Proponents of school uniforms claim that the policy makes schools safer and creates a more positive environment , but opponents say that it places unnecessary limits on students and and can be costly .<-->O
Makes Schools Safer Supporters of uniforms claim they can increase school safety .<-->N
Uniforms allow staff to quickly identify people who do not belong on campus and limit the ways that gangs can identify themselves .<-->N
In 1994 , Long Beach United School District in California began requiring uniforms with the hopes of improving safety .<-->N
Just five years later , the overall crime rate in the district was down 91 percent .<-->N
Specifically , sex offenses dropped 96 percent and number of incidents of vandalism had decreased 69 percent .<-->N
Creates a Positive Environment When all students are dressed alike , economic and social barriers between students are reduced .<-->N
There is no peer pressure to wear expensive clothes or bullying of those who ca n't afford designer labels .<-->O
Children have one less distraction , as they do not have to concern themselves with what others are wearing .<-->O
Common dress can also make students feel like they belong to the school community , increase pride and even improve attendance .<-->O
A 2012 study by the University of Houston of 160 public , urban schools , found that student attendance increased after schools began mandating uniforms .<-->N
Academic Achievement Supporters of school uniforms often cite increased academic achievement as a main reason to adopt such a policy .<-->O
While there is some anecdotal evidence to support this claim , overall , studies yield inconclusive results .<-->O
A study by Ryan Yeung analyzed student data collected from 1988 to 2004 .<-->N
His research found that although some test scores were higher for schools that required uniforms , in others , scores were actually lower .<-->N
Limits Rights Some opponents claim that uniforms are not a fix-all for the problems that plague schools , but instead , violate a student 's right to express themselves , as guaranteed by the First Amendment .<-->O
They claim that a dress code can provide guidelines and exclusions for certain types of dress , such as clothing with drug references or vulgar language printed on them , while still allowing students to make their own choices and be an individual .<-->O
Cost Even with uniforms , parents would still need to purchase `` regular '' clothes for when students are not in school , thus creating an additional expense .<-->O
A 2012 presentation by North Brunswick Township Public Schools in New Jersey reported the average cost for families to purchase uniforms would be about $ 300 per student each year .<-->N
Students receiving free or reduced lunch would not be required to purchase uniforms , but instead , this expense would be covered by the school .<-->O
In this particular district , that means needing over $ 700,000 in additional funds .<-->N
------------------------------ 10 What 's the point of school uniform ?<-->N
A shirt , tie and blazer may not be the ingredients for my favourite outfit , but if I were given the choice , I would n't throw away the idea of school uniform .<-->O
Wearing a uniform is a badge of pride , creates an identity for a school and is an important part of being a school student .<-->O
`` Uniforms show that you are part of an organisation .<-->N
Wearing it says we 're all in this together , '' Jason Wing , head teacher at the Neale-Wade academy in Cambridgeshire , says .<-->N
`` Also , if you wear your uniform with pride , it means you are half way there to being respectful , buying into what the organisation is all about . ''<-->O
Claire Howlette , an English teacher , agrees : `` Uniforms give students a sense of belonging to a particular school and create an identity for the school in the community . ''<-->N
My school is one of many that seem to be reverting to a more formal uniform this September I will be wearing a shirt and blazer instead of my old jumper and polo shirt .<-->O
A number of students have complained about the change , but general opinion is that the jumpers and polo shirts were `` childish '' .<-->O
A school uniform teaches students to dress smartly and take pride in their appearance .<-->O
Howlette says : `` Uniforms help students to prepare for when they leave school and may have to dress smartly or wear a uniform . ''<-->O
Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction , sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment , allowing students to perform better academically .<-->O
Perhaps most importantly , a uniform means students do n't have to worry about peer pressure when it comes to their clothes .<-->O
When everyone is dressed the same , worrying about what you look like is n't so important .<-->O
There is no competition about being dressed in the latest trend , which would put a great deal of financial pressure on students and parents .<-->O
Potential bullies have one less target for their insults ; it 's hard to make fun of what someone is wearing when you 're dressed exactly the same .<-->O
In America , where a majority of schools do not have a uniform , roughly 160,000 children miss school every day due to fear of attack or intimidation by other students .<-->O
This might not be directly linked to what they 're wearing , but having a uniform can be a safety net for many students who might otherwise suffer from bullying .<-->O
A strict uniform gives the impression that rules are strict too , perhaps helping maintain a sense of order at school Although wearing a school uniform is less expensive than buying a whole wardrobe of outfits , uniform can still be pricey .<-->O
Many schools have a specific supplier , and wearing cheaper alternatives can result in punishment if the black skirt you 're wearing is n't exactly the right black skirt .<-->O
Finding uniform that fits you , especially if you 're limited to one shop , can also be a struggle .<-->O
Recently the Liberal Democrats held a conference about the cost of school uniforms across England .<-->N
The education minister David Laws is to issue new guidance to end the practice of using a single uniform supplier , enabling parents to shop around for uniform .<-->O
If schools decide to change their uniform , for example with a new emblem or colour , changes should be restricted to one or two items , preferably with sew-on logos .<-->O
Changing from a one-supplier system could help families with the cost of school uniform .<-->O
Although it might seem a shame to miss out on those two years of dressing as you like at school , I welcome the smart dress code .<-->O
Not only does it make getting dressed each morning a lot easier , but it sets sixth formers up as role models for younger students , and that 's important .<-->N
Macy Vallance , a year-eight student , says : `` I like uniforms because everyone is the same and no one can be left out by the way they are dressed .<-->N
Our new uniform looks smarter , which is good . ''<-->O
My uniform might not be what I would wear in my own time , but it gives me a sense of belonging , takes away the pressure of what to wear and deters the bullies .<-->O
School uniform is n't fashionable , but that 's exactly why I think it should be here to stay .<-->O
